[2. 2019_Limiting-Global-Warming] POSTNOTE Number 594 February 2019  Limiting Global Warming to 1.5°C Overview  A 2018 UN Special Report examined how peak global warming can be limited to 1.5°C and the implications of doing so. The UK has a statutory long-term target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which is expected to tighten in future. This POSTnote outlines key features of the Special Report and UK responses to climate change.  Background The Paris Agreement on climate change (Box 1) was agreed in 2015. Its main goal is to limit average global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial temperatures, and to ‘pursue efforts’ to limit warming to 1.5°C.1,2 This is more ambitious than a prior goal of below 2°C.3 In 2018, scientists working with the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reviewed the evidence base on the impacts and implications of a 1.5°C limit. Its resulting Special Report was published in Box 1: UN COPs and the 2015 Paris Agreement The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was established in 1992 with the objective of preventing dangerous climate change,4 via international negotiations at annual Conferences of the Parties (COPs). The 2015 Paris Agreement, agreed at COP21, was the first legally binding global climate deal. It was negotiated and agreed by 196 parties in December 2015, and 184 had ratified in December 2018. The Agreement has three specific goals:1 ◼ Hold global temperature rise at ‘well below’ 2°C above preindustrial levels and pursue efforts to limit this rise to 1.5°C ◼ Increase the ability to adapt to adverse climate change impacts without threatening food production ◼ Use international finance for these aims (Box 4). Paris signatories are required to submit a ‘Nationally Determined Contribution’ (NDC) plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions which takes effect in 2020.5 Current NDCs would result in warming of around 3°C or more,6 though the Agreement’s ‘ambition mechanism’ reviews and seeks to increase NDC ambitions every 5 years.  ◼ The Paris Agreement aims to limit average global warming to well below 2°C, and towards 1.5°C, above pre-industrial levels. There has been 1°C of warming to date. ◼ A 2018 UN assessment examined the implications of limiting warming to 1.5°C. ◼ Global warming of 1.5°C would result in risks to natural and human systems, but many of these risks would be greater at 2°C. ◼ Different options for keeping warming below this level exist. Global net CO2 emissions would likely need to halve by around 2030 and reach zero around 2050. This entails substantial technological and social change. CO2 would likely need to be removed from the atmosphere at unprecedented levels. October 2018 (Box 2).7–12 This POSTnote summarises the key messages of the Special Report on approaches to meeting the target and impacts of 1.5°C global warming. It also examines UK approaches to climate change mitigation and adaptation, and potential changes to emissions targets.  Increasing Global Temperature Global warming is the increasing trend in global average surface temperature which is a key driver of climate change. Greenhouse gas (GHG) from human activity have caused global warming of 1°C since pre-industrial times, and global temperature is currently increasing by 0.2°C per decade.8 This is measured as an average across long timeframes (30 years) and across temperatures over land and ocean.8 Warming has been greater over land than over oceans, and has been greatest in Arctic regions.8 The level of warming to date is almost entirely caused by human emissions of different types:8,13 ◼ Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the GHG emitted in greatest quantity by human activity. It is the most dominant GHG over long time periods,14 as it is chemically stable and can remain in the atmosphere for many thousands of years. Although natural CO2 emissions from plants, soils and oceans are much greater than human emissions, these natural emissions are in equilibrium with removal of CO2 by natural ‘sinks’ (such as oceans and plants). ◼ Non-CO2 GHGs include methane, nitrous oxide and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), among others. Nitrous oxide  The Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, Westminster, London SW1A 0AA; Tel: 020 7219 2840; email: post@parliament.uk www.parliament.uk/post  POSTNOTE 594 February 2019 Limiting Global Warming to 1.5 C  Box 2: IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C Scientific experts emphasise that no specific temperature target should be seen as a safe limit,15 and that “efforts should be made to push the defence line as low as possible”.16,17 Climate negotiations before COP21 focused on a limit of below 2°C above pre-industrial levels.3,18 Interest in a 1.5°C limit increased from 2008, driven by small island states’ concerns around risks from sea level rise at 2°C.19 In 2015 the UNFCCC invited the IPCC to assess the evidence base on the implications of limiting warming to 1.5°C relative to 2°C. The IPCC assessed over 6000 research papers to produce a 2018 Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C.7–12 and some HFCs persist for centuries.20 Others, such as methane and black carbon, are ‘short-lived climate pollutants’ (SLCPs) (POSTnote 480), which generally break down in the atmosphere within decades. SLCPs cause greater warming in the short term.21,22 ◼ Aerosols are particles emitted from human and natural sources (many industrial and transport pollutants are aerosols). They reflect or absorb sunlight and affect cloud growth, and are short-lived (persisting for weeks at most). They have an overall cooling effect.23 Long-term temperature rise is primarily dependent on the cumulative amount of CO2 emitted by human activity since pre-industrial times (as well as some long-lived non-CO2 GHGs such as nitrous oxide).20,24,25 High annual SLCP emissions increase the rate of warming in coming decades, which makes limiting warming to 1.5°C more challenging.26  Reducing Emissions for a 1.5°C Limit All GHG emissions must be substantially reduced for temperature increase to peak at, or close to, 1.5°C. Temperature will peak when CO2 emissions are net zero and SLCP emissions are constant or declining. Different approaches to meeting these aims exist. Slower emissions reductions over the next decade require greater use of unproven greenhouse gas removal (GGR) in later decades, and increase the likelihood that temperature rise temporarily ‘overshoots’ 1.5°C.  Emissions Reduction Pathways Scenarios resulting from ‘integrated assessment models’, which describe the global economy, energy and land use are used to illustrate pathways of how emissions and temperature could develop in the 21st century.9 CO2 Pathways Annual human CO2 emissions are increasing; 2018 global emissions were estimated to be 2.7% higher than in 2017. 27 Most 1.5°C pathways suggest that global CO2 emissions would need to peak in the near future, be halved around 2030, and reach net zero around 2050.24,25,28 Net zero occurs when human CO2 emissions are equal to the amount removed from the atmosphere by GGR. The ‘remaining carbon budget’ (Box 3) for a 1.5°C limit is estimated to be equivalent to 10-15 years of CO2 emissions at 2018 levels.9 Non-CO2 Pathways Pathways for 1.5°C generally require deep reductions in non-CO2 emissions (nitrous oxide, SLCPs and aerosols), but not that net zero is reached for these. For SLCP  Page 2  Box 3: Remaining Carbon Budgets Estimates of the amount of the ‘remaining’ CO2 that can be emitted in the future, before reaching a given level of warming, are known as ‘remaining carbon budgets’. They are given in quantities of CO2. The IPCC estimates a remaining global carbon budget (from the beginning of 2018) for limiting to 1.5°C of 420–580 billion tonnes (Gt) of CO2.9 This is equivalent to 10-15yr of global CO2 emissions at 2018 levels.27 This estimate was revised upwards from a 2014 IPCC estimate of 120Gt,20 due to a better scientific understanding of levels of historical warming and the amount of warming caused by additional CO2 and non-CO2 emissions.9 There are large uncertainties around these factors. Complex ‘feedbacks’ (such as methane release from melting permafrost) (POSTnote 454) could reduce the remaining budget. emissions such as methane, black carbon and HFCs, a constant or declining annual level of emissions is required at the time of peak temperature.8,9,26 Reductions in aerosol emissions would occur naturally along with many GHG emissions reductions measures (for example, closing coal power plants reduces CO2 and aerosol emissions).9 Decreasing aerosol concentrations would act to increase temperature, but these would be offset by GHG reductions.9  Reducing Emissions to Meet Pathways Reducing global emissions in line with 1.5°C pathways would require social and technological changes to: 8,9 ◼ Energy systems, including growth in renewables and less power and fuel production from fossil fuel sources ◼ Transport and buildings, reducing energy demand and increasing the proportion of energy from electricity ◼ Lifestyle and behaviour, reducing demand for high-CO2 transport, meat or GHG-intensive consumer goods ◼ ‘Difficult-to-decarbonise’ sectors in which technical solutions are challenging, e.g., aviation and agriculture. A 1.5°C target can be met using a combination of the above and GGR. Pathways involving greater lifestyle change rely less on GGR.8 IPCC experts suggest that in any case the emissions reductions required imply “rapid, far-reaching changes on an unprecedented scale”.29 Current NDC pledges for the Paris Agreement (Box 1) could result in around 3°C of warming.6,9,30  Greenhouse Gas Removal and Overshoot GGR (POSTnote 549) encompasses a range of processes that remove CO2 from the atmosphere (there are no proven ways of removing non-CO2 GHGs). These include three broad categories of GGR: ◼ Land-based removals enhance natural systems’ ability to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere. This includes growth, restoration or better management of forest, wetlands and soils, among other processes.31,32 ◼ Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) converts plant-based fuel (biomass) into other energy carriers (such as electricity or hydrogen). It stores the waste CO2 using carbon capture and storage (CCS). ◼ Direct Air Capture with CCS (DACCS) captures CO2 directly from the atmosphere, and stores it using CCS.33 All 1.5°C and most 2°C pathways require some level of GGR. In many scenarios, temperature rise temporarily overshoots and then returns, to 1.5°C, by using GGR to make global net CO2 emissions negative.9  POSTNOTE 594 February 2019 Limiting Global Warming to 1.5 C  Most forms of emissions reduction are expected to be less costly and more technologically feasible than most forms of GGR.34,35 It is unclear how feasible it would be to increase GGR at the scales generally required by 1.5°C pathways, because of significant technological, economic and social challenges.9,11,36,37 All GGR techniques (except increasing forest cover) are at early stages of development and all result in competition for resources (land, water or energy). 36 Land-based approaches can only provide a finite amount of GGR.11 BECCS needs large inputs of biomass using land and water, which could impact biodiversity and food production.36–38 DACCS is currently costly and requires a high energy input.34 GGR will be necessary to offset emissions in 2050 and beyond from difficult-to-decarbonise sectors.39 Experts highlight the risks of relying on future developments in GGR techniques which could prove less effective than hoped;40 the Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering suggest pursuing a range of GGR approaches to avoid this.34 To develop GGR at lowest risk, they and other groups recommend focusing on developing CCS technology and infrastructure, improving natural carbon sinks (e.g. forestation and soils), and increasing R&D.34,35 An £8.6m UK research programme examining the feasibility of GGR processes launched in 2017.41 In 2018 a pilot BECCS project began operating at Drax Power Station in Selby. 42  Global Impacts of Climate Change at 1.5°C There is strong evidence that human-induced climate change to date has impacted natural ecosystems, human systems and human well-being globally.10 Future risks to these are expected to be lower at 1.5°C than at 2°C, but impacts vary widely across regions.43,44 A larger and longer overshoot increases these risks, as some impacts at higher temperature, such as ecosystem loss, may be irreversible.10 Adaptation (the process of addressing climate change risks to lower their impact) will be required at any temperature increase, but costs of doing so will be lower at 1.5°C.12 Research on UK climate change impacts at 1.5°C of warming relative to 2°C is limited. Met Office UK Climate Projections 2018 (UKCP18) provide information on potential temperature, rainfall and sea level rise under different future emissions scenarios.45  Changes to Natural Systems Extreme Weather Extreme weather refers to individual extreme events, such as temperature (e.g. heatwaves) and rainfall. Extreme events amplify the risks of increasing temperature within a specific region.46 More frequent and intense extreme weather is expected to occur at 2°C average warming than at 1.5°C.10,47 Limiting warming to 1.5°C may lead to extreme heat being less intense (the hottest days being less hot) than at 2°C, particularly in the mid-latitudes, further from the equator.10 Around 500m fewer people would be frequently exposed to extreme heatwaves at 1.5°C than at 2°C,48 and around a fifth of excess heat-related deaths in cities such as London may be avoided.49 Limiting to 1.5°C would reduce risks from heavy precipitation events, and substantially  Page 3  reduce the probability of extreme drought and other water availability risks in certain regions.10 Sub-Saharan Africa is projected to be at particular risk of extreme heat and drought.50 Sea Level Rise Global warming of 1.5°C is projected to cause sea level rise (SLR) (POSTnote 555) of 26-77cm by 2100 – on average 10cm less than projected for 2°C. SLR at 2°C would affect up to 10.4m more people. Regardless of peak temperature, SLR will continue well past 2100 and could increase by a number of metres after then if polar ice-sheet ‘tipping points’ are reached and the Greenland or West Antarctic Ice Sheet collapse. There is uncertainty around the temperature at which this could happen, but the risk will increase substantially as temperature rise increases past 1.5°C.10,51 Impacts on Marine and Arctic Ecosystems Warming of 2°C and above makes the Arctic Ocean substantially more likely to be ice-free in summer than at 1.5°C.52 This would make animals such as polar bears, whales and seals that depend on Arctic ice, as well as Arctic communities, more at risk.10 Oceans have absorbed about 30% of human-emitted CO2 to date,20 resulting in ocean acidification and changes to marine chemistry that are unprecedented in 65m years.53,54 Upper ocean temperatures have increased and will continue to do so. Plankton and fish species are projected to move to higher latitudes, whereas less mobile species are more at risk. Global warming of 1.5°C is projected to cause a 70-90% decline in warm water coral reefs, whereas at 2°C more than 99% are expected to disappear.10,55,56 Impacts on Terrestrial Ecosystems Terrestrial ecosystems and organisms would be less at risk at 1.5°C than at 2°C.10 The projected area of land affected by significant ecosystem change is reduced (from roughly 13% to 4% of global land area).57 Severe geographic range reduction is approximately half under 1.5°C compared to 2°C for vertebrates and plants, and reduced by two thirds for insects.58 Projected increases in wildfire frequency further threatens terrestrial ecosystems at 2°C.10  Risks to Human Systems Climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply and human security make it more challenging to meet several UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Box 4). These risks are greater at 2°C warming, though adaptation will be necessary at any level of warming. Small island states and economically disadvantaged nations are at greater risk as they have less capacity to adapt. Food and Water Security Climate change affects food availability, quality, access and distribution. Although moderately warmer conditions and greater atmospheric CO2 concentrations can, in theory, act to increase crop yield,59 these effects are complex and do not occur for every crop or region. The combination of wider climate change effects (extreme weather, increasing precipitation and temperature) will have negative effects on crop yields.10 Climate change to date has resulted in more yield reductions than increases.60 Limiting warming to 1.5°C  POSTNOTE 594 February 2019 Limiting Global Warming to 1.5 C  Box 4: Equity in Meeting Climate Change Targets Differentiated Responsibility and Climate Funding Developing countries are, in general, less responsible for historical climate change and less able to pay for adaptation and mitigation. These and other ‘equity’ issues result in disagreement over how much responsibility individual countries should have for the remaining global carbon budget,61–64 and international climate finance. The Paris Agreement contains a commitment to mobilise $100bn annually by 2020 from a range of public and private sources in developed countries to financially assist developing countries for mitigation and adaptation measures.1,18 $57bn of public finance was raised in 2017.65 The UK is the second-largest donor to multilateral UN climate funds.66 Sustainable Development Limiting warming to 1.5°C rather than 2°C would make it easier to achieve a number of SDGs.12 Adaptation measures for 1.5°C would have benefits for sustainable development, poverty and inequality reduction goals. Pathways for 1.5°C would help achieve SDGs 3 (health), 7 (clean energy) and 11 (cities and communities) among others. Some mitigation pathways, if not managed carefully, could make it more difficult to achieve SDGs 1 (poverty), SDG 2 (hunger), 6 (water) and 7 (energy access). Pathways that reduce energy demand would decrease these trade-offs.7,12 is projected to lead to smaller reductions of maize, rice and wheat yield, particularly in West and Central Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central and South America.10 Greater use of GGR increases potential risks to food security. 12 At less than 2°C of warming, changes in population have a stronger effect on water security than climate change.10 However, limiting to 1.5°C rather than 2°C could lead to up to half the number of additional people (compared to now) at risk of water scarcity.10 Human Health and Wellbeing Climate-related negative health outcomes have been observed and will increase with future warming.10,20 Increased transmission of infectious diseases (such as malaria or dengue fever), exposure to heatwaves and fires, undernutrition and reduced labour productivity in vulnerable populations are likely to lead to greater risks of injuries, disease and death. Overall, 2°C poses greater risks to human health than 1.5°C, with regional differences. Adaptation could reduce the magnitude of these impacts.10  UK Climate Change Policy The UK Climate Change Act 2008 (CCA) provides the framework for climate change mitigation and adaptation in the four UK nations.67 The independent Committee on Climate Change (CCC), set up under the CCA, advises the UK and devolved governments on these issues.  Reducing UK Emissions Current UK Emissions and Targets Territorial UK CO2 emissions (those produced in the UK) are 43% lower than in 1990, mainly because most coal power (which is highly CO2 emitting) has been replaced by natural gas and renewable generation.68 There has been much less of a decline in national ‘consumption-based emissions’. These include emissions from manufacturing goods and services that are imported into the UK.69,70 They are not counted towards carbon budgets.  Page 4  Box 5: UK Carbon Budgets Statutory UK carbon budgets (which differ from remaining carbon budget estimates (Box 3)) are interim GHG emissions targets for fiveyearly periods from 2008 onwards. Budgets decrease in each successive period. They are set by the UK Government 12 years in advance following advice from the CCC, and cover territorial GHG emissions from all sectors except international shipping and aviation.71 The CCA sets an overall UK GHG emissions reduction target of at least 80% by 2050 (compared to 1990), as well as interim ‘carbon budget’ targets (Box 5).67 The CCC annually reports on UK progress on carbon budgets.72 The first and second budgets (2008–2018) have been met. However, the CCC has raised concerns that current policies for reducing emissions from heating (in buildings and industry) and transport will be insufficient to meet the fourth (2023–2027) and fifth (2028–2032) budgets.71,72 Future Changes to Targets The UK’s long-term target was designed to contribute to a 2°C global warming target.39 Because of the raised ambition of the Paris Agreement (Box 2), many commentators have suggested that current UK targets should be amended.73,74 Different equity assumptions (Box 4) lead to a UK allocation of between 0.8% and 1.5% of the remaining global budget. 75 The UK Government has indicated that it will legislate for a net zero emissions target.76,77 In October 2018 it requested that the CCC provide advice on the timing and level of UK GHG emissions that would contribute to limiting warming to well below 2°C, and to 1.5°C.78 The UK Government has indicated it does not currently seek to change the level of the fourth and fifth carbon budgets,78 though the CCC is still able to advise greater action before 2032 as the least-cost pathway.72,79 It plans to publish its advice in spring 2019.78  Adapting to Climate Change in the UK Defra assesses potential future impacts in the Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA) (Box 6) every five years.80 The UK Government sets out the responding adaptation framework for England in the National Adaptation Programme (NAP).82 The CCC will present a formal assessment of the NAP in 2019.83,84 Adaptation is also addressed under the Scottish Climate Change Adaptation Programme,85,86 the Welsh Government National Adaptation Strategy and Northern Ireland Adaptation Programme.87,88 Box 6: The Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA) The second CCRA, published in 2017, focused on potential climate impacts at 2°C and 4°C.80 Greatest risks identified include:80,81 ◼ Flood risk to communities, businesses and infrastructure ◼ Exposure to high temperature and heatwaves ◼ Water shortage risk for the public, agriculture and industry ◼ Risks to natural ecosystems and UK wildlife ◼ Risks to UK and international food production and trade ◼ New and emerging pests and diseases. It suggests that more action is needed to address these issues, and that emerging pests should be a research priority. The CCRA also highlights some opportunities for the UK arising from moderate levels of climate change, such as prolonged agricultural growing seasons.80  POST is an office of both Houses of Parliament, charged with providing independent and balanced analysis of policy issues that have a basis in science and technology.

This is otherwise known as a net zero target because some emissions can remain if they are offset by removal from the atmosphere and/or by trading in carbon units. The Order came into force on 27 June 2019. This legislation broadly puts into effect a May 2019 recommendation from the Committee on Climate Change (the independent statutory body set up to monitor and advise on progress towards the UK’s emission targets). However, it diverges from the recommendation that the target be achieved by domestic action only by retaining the ability to use international carbon credits. The new target was announced by then Prime Minister Theresa May in a Downing Street Press release in June 2019 and was widely welcomed by the Committee on Climate Change and other stakeholders including industry and environmental groups. If met, this target would effectively mean that the UK will end its contribution to global emissions by 2050. Before this amendment, the UK had a long-term emissions reduction target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050, compared to 1990 levels, set by the Climate Change Act 2008. Since passing this legislation, the Government has announced a HM Treasury Net Zero Review. This included a priority to ensure a fair balance of contributions from all those who will benefit, including considering how to reduce costs for low income households. The Review will also consider how to avoid offshoring emissions i.e. how to reduce UK emissions without causing those emissions to be created by another country. A final report is expected in Autumn 2020. More information on existing decarbonisation targets and progress against them is available in the House of Commons Library briefing paper on UK Carbon Budgets (20 February 2019). Background on net zero is available in the Library’s October 2018 insight Net zero emissions: A new UK climate change target?  4  Net zero in the UK  1. Net zero recommendations and commitments 1.1 International context The UK is a Party to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and has signed and ratified the Paris Agreement: an international agreement on climate change. The key aim of the Paris Agreement is to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C. The Agreement also included a widelyacknowledged net zero global greenhouse gas emissions aim for the second half of this century. 1 Following the Paris Agreement, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published a Special Report in October 2018 which found that limiting global warming to 1.5°C is possible but would require unprecedented “rapid and far reaching” changes in all aspects of society, including a need to reach ‘net zero’ by around 2050. 2 The UK will host the UN climate change conference (COP26) at the end of 2020 in Glasgow, which will focus on implementing the Paris Agreement’s aims. Claire Perry is the UK nominated President for COP26. Further background and information on international climate change action is available in the Library Briefing paper on the Climate change conference (COP24): Katowice, Poland.  1.2 Committee on Climate Change recommendation On 15 October 2018, following the publication of the IPCC Special Report, the then Minister for Energy and Clean Growth (Claire Perry) wrote to the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) to ask for updated advice on a date by which the UK should achieve a net zero greenhouse gas emissions target (including whether now is the right time for the UK to set such a target). 3 The Scottish and Welsh Cabinet Secretaries co-signed the letter. Prior to this, the UK Government had requested and followed CCC advice on UK action following the Paris Agreement from October 2016: that it was then too early to set a UK net zero target but to keep it under review. 4 In a further commitment to keep the approach under 1  2  3  4  Article 4 includes an aim “to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century” IPCC, Summary for policymakers of IPCC special report on global warming of 1.5˚C approved by governments, 8 October 2018 Gov.uk, UK climate targets: request for advice from the Committee on Climate Change, 15 October 2018 See: PQ 34423 [on Climate Change Convention: Paris] 22 April 2016 and Committee on Climate Change, UK climate action following the Paris Agreement, October 2016  5  Commons Library Briefing, 16 December 2019  review, Prime Minister May’s June 2019 announcement on legislating for net zero retained a review mechanism by including a commitment that the UK will conduct a further assessment within five years to confirm that other countries are taking similar action and to ensure that UK industries do not face unfair competition. 5 On 2 May 2019, the CCC published its Report on Net Zero: the UK’s contribution to stopping global warming which recommended the Government legislate for a new emissions target for the UK of net-zero greenhouse gases by 2050. The executive summary included the following: The UK should set and vigorously pursue an ambitious target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) to 'net-zero' by 2050, ending the UK's contribution to global warming within 30 years. Reflecting their respective circumstances, Scotland should set a net-zero GHG target for 2045 and Wales should target a 95% reduction by 2050 relative to 1990. A net-zero GHG target for 2050 will deliver on the commitment that the UK made by signing the Paris Agreement. It is achievable with known technologies, alongside improvements in people's lives, and within the expected economic cost that Parliament accepted when it legislated the existing 2050 target for an 80% reduction from 1990. However, this is only possible if clear, stable and well-designed policies to reduce emissions further are introduced across the economy without delay. Current policy is insufficient for even the existing targets. A net-zero GHG target for 2050 would respond to the latest climate science and fully meet the UK's obligations under the Paris Agreement […]. 6  1.3 Political support Prior to her announcement, more than 192 cross-party MPs and 53 members of the House of Lords had signed a letter calling on Prime Minister May to back a net zero emissions target ahead of 2050. 7 A net zero target was also backed by opposition parties in the lead up to the new target. An announcement at the Labour Party conference 2018 stated a Labour government would back a net zero emissions by 2050 target, while the Liberal Democrats would legislate for net zero by 2050. The SNP agreed that a net zero target for 2050 or sooner is “the right goal” but that statutory targets must be credible and responsible.

Box 1: 2019 manifesto commitments to net zero The Conservative Party pledged to lead the global fight against climate change by delivering on its world-leading target of Net Zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, as advised by the independent Committee on Climate Change. Pledges included: investment in clean energy solutions and green infrastructure; consulting on the earliest date by which the sale of new conventional petrol and diesel cars can be phased out; and a £640 million Nature for Climate fund with an additional 75,000 acres of trees a year by the end of the next Parliament. 8 The Labour Party pledged to put the UK on track for a net zero carbon energy system within the 2030s; to achieve net zero carbon food production in Britain by 2040; and to phase out combustion engine vehicles by 2030. 9 The Labour Party also pledged to plant two billion trees by 2040 in its Plan for Nature. The Liberal Democrats pledged to deliver a ten-year emergency programme to cut emissions substantially straight away, and phase out emissions from the remaining hard-to-treat sectors by 2045 at the latest. Priorities included: insulating all Britain’s homes by 2030; achieving at least 80% of UK electricity being generated from renewables by 2030; planting 60 million trees a year; electrifying Britain’s railways and ensuring all new cars are electric by 2030. 10 The Scottish National Party pledged to demand that the UK accelerates its action to meet Scotland’s climate change targets of a 75% reduction in emissions by 2030, net zero carbon emissions no later than 2040 and net zero of all emissions by 2045. 11 Plaid Cymru pledged to create tens of thousands of new jobs throughout Wales by kick-starting a multi-billion investment programme in renewable energy, transport infrastructure and digital technology, with the goal of making Wales a carbon free nation by 2030. 12 The Green Party introduced a “Green new deal” with a combined investment of over £100 billion a year and pledged that it would get the UK on track to achieve net zero by 2030. 13  8  9 10 11 12 13  Conservative and Unionist Party Manifesto 2019: Get Brexit Done, Unleash Britain’s Potential The Labour Party Manifesto 2019: It’s time for real change Liberal Democrats Manifesto 2019: Stop Brexit, Build a brighter future Scottish National Party manifesto 2019: Stronger for Scotland Plaid Cymru manifesto 2019: Wales, it’s us Green Party manifesto 2019: If not now, when?  7  Commons Library Briefing, 16 December 2019  2. Amending the Climate Change Act 2008 2.1 Climate Change Act 2008 (2050 Target Amendment) Order 2019 The Climate Change Act 2008 (2050 Target Amendment) Order 2019 (the 2019 amendment Order) amends Section 1 of the Climate Change Act 2008 to change the target for the net UK carbon account from at least 80% lower than the 1990 baseline to at least 100% lower. It came into force on 27 June 2019. It is accompanied by an Explanatory Memorandum. The Government did not produce an accompanying impact assessment for the draft Order. The then interim Minister for Energy and Clean Growth (Chris Skidmore) explained the reason for this as follows: The way that the legislation from the Climate Change Act 2008 has been framed means that impact assessments are not needed specifically for the SI. We did not have an impact assessment when we moved from 60% to 80%, because the risk is incumbent on Government in making the legislation. The impact assessments that are needed under the framework of the Act arise through the carbon budgets themselves. 14  The House of Lords Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee published a report which drew special attention of the House of Lords to the draft Order and stated that the economic and societal changes that will be required should have been acknowledged by the Government: Given the significant economic and wider societal changes that will be required to meet the zero emissions target, the Committee believes that the Department should have acknowledged in the Explanatory Memorandum this far-reaching impact and summarised the work that is underway to assess the significant costs and wider implications of the transition. 15  These points were picked up in the subsequent debate on the draft Order in the House of Lords and are discussed further in section 4 of this paper. Section 2(1) of the Climate Change Act 2008 gives the Secretary of State the power to amend the target (either by amending the percentage or the baseline year) through secondary legislation. The target can only be amended if certain conditions are met. In this case the following are relevant: The power in subsection (1)(a) may only be exercised— (a) if it appears to the Secretary of State that there have been significant developments in— (i) scientific knowledge about climate change, or (ii) European or international law or policy, 14 15  HC Deb 24 June 2019 Col 509 House of Lords Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee, 53rd Report of Session 2017-19, 20 June 2019, HL Paper 838  8  Net zero in the UK  that make it appropriate to do so 16  The 2019 amendment Order states that “there have been significant developments in scientific knowledge about climate change” since the Act was passed that make it appropriate to amend the percentage set out in section 1(1) of the Act. This power has not been used before. When the target was previously increased from 60% to 80% in 2008 under the then Labour Government, the Climate Change Bill was still progressing through Parliament. 17 Section 2(6) of the Climate Change Act 2008 states that an order to amend the target for the net UK carbon account will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, meaning it must be approved by both Houses of Parliament. The draft instrument was debated and approved by the House of Commons on 24 June 2019; 18 and by the House of Lords (with a Labour amendment to the motion being agreed) on 26 June 2019. 19 The key areas of debate in both Houses are discussed further in section 4 of this paper below.  2.2 Devolved Administrations The 2019 amendment Order amends the Climate Change Act 2008 which applies to the whole of the UK. The Explanatory Memorandum confirmed that the Government had taken into account representations from the devolved Administrations who had not raised any issues with the amendment proposed. 20 In its net zero report, the CCC recommended a UK wide target, but suggested that, in order to reflect their respective circumstances, Scotland should set an earlier target (net zero by 2045) and Wales should target 95% emissions reduction by 2050. The CCC’s report noted that in the absence of a Minister, Northern Ireland officials indicated their support for the advice being sought. Northern Ireland does not currently have its own long-term target for emissions but is included within UK targets. 21 In addition to the Climate Change Act 2008, Wales and Scotland have their own legislation on decarbonisation targets. Shortly after the CCC published its report, the Scottish Ministers proposed amendments to the Scottish Climate Change Bill which would set a 2045 target for net-zero in Scotland. 22 The resulting Climate Change (Emissions Reduction Targets) (Scotland) Act 2019 amends the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 and set new targets for Scotland to reduce Scotland's emissions of all greenhouse gases to net zero by 2045 at the latest, with interim  16 17  18 19 20  21  22  Section 2(2) Climate Change Act 2008 HC Deb 16 October 2008, Col 939.

The Environment (Wales) Act 2016 places a duty on Welsh Ministers to ensure that net emissions are 80% lower than the baseline by 2050. The Welsh Government said that it accepts the CCC’s recommendation but wants to go beyond it. The Welsh Minister for Environment, Energy and Rural Affairs announced in June that the Welsh Government will therefore bring regulations before the Assembly in 2020 on a net-zero by 2050 target for Wales. 23  23  Welsh Government, Wales accepts Committee on Climate Change 95% emissions reduction target, 11 June 2019  10 Net zero in the UK  3. Commentary and analysis In its debate on the draft amendment Order, the House of Lords approved a Labour amendment to the motion “That the draft Order laid before the House on 12 June be approved” (155 Contents; 116 Not Contents) as follows: “and that this House supports the objective of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, and acknowledges the substantial implications of this Order for the United Kingdom; but regrets that Her Majesty’s Government have (1) given little detail of how the emissions target will be met; (2) made a substantial change in policy without the full and proper scrutiny that such a change deserves; and (3) not introduced regulations under section 30 of the Climate Change Act 2008 to include greenhouse gases from (a) international aviation, or (b) international shipping, as part of the emissions target” 24  These points, along with some others, are discussed in more detail below.  3.1 An earlier target? While the net-zero target commitment has widespread support, some argue it should be met earlier. For example, the environmental charity WWF and the campaign group Extinction Rebellion have both suggested that the net zero target could be met by 2045 and 2025 respectively. See Box 1 for the main political party’s views on when the target should be. These calls were examined further by the Business Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Committee as part of its Clean Growth Strategy inquiry. On 18 June 2019 the BEIS Committee examined the rationale for alternative targets proposed by environmental organisations in an evidence session with Extinction Rebellion, WWF and the Environmental Defense Fund. 25 The Labour Chair of the BEIS Committee summed up the views as follows in a subsequent House of Commons debate: Our Committee took evidence last week, including from the World Wide Fund for Nature, which said that a target of 2045 was eminently possible. We heard other evidence that by 2050 we should be looking not at net zero, but at taking carbon out of the atmosphere, as my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test (Dr Whitehead) said earlier, with a 120% target to do exactly that. I hope that when we have the five-year review we can look at being more radical and going further, so that we achieve net zero before 2050 and continue to be a world leader and ensure that we are at the forefront of creating green jobs and taking the opportunities that meeting this target will offer. 26  The Committee on Climate Change advised against an earlier target at this time and explained 2050 was an appropriate target for the following reasons: 24 25  26  HL Deb 26 June 2019 Col 1087 BEIS, Oral evidence: Clean Growth Strategy and International Climate Change Targets, HC 871, 18 June 2019 HC Deb 24 June 2019 Col 524  11 Commons Library Briefing, 16 December 2019  Based on our current understanding, it is the latest date for the UK credibly to maintain its status as a climate leader and the earliest to be credibly deliverable alongside other government objectives. 27  The CCC’s Report goes onto to explain further: We have considered whether an earlier date than 2050 should be targeted. An earlier date has been proposed by some groups and might send a stronger signal internationally to those considering increasing their own ambition, but only if it is viewed as credible. While our scenarios demonstrate that some sectors (e.g. the power sector) could reach net-zero emissions by 2045, for most sectors 2050 currently appears to be the earliest credible date. An earlier date would also give less time to develop currently speculative options as alternatives to make up for any shortfall from other measures. That could lead to a need for punitive policies and early capital scrappage to stay on track to the target. 28  3.2 International credits The CCC recommended that the target should be met through UK domestic effort only, i.e. that international carbon credits should not be used. International carbon credits refer to the international emissions trading market, which is explained further by the UNFCCC pages on international emissions trading. Counter to the CCC recommendation, the Government press release stated that it would “retain the ability to use” international carbon credits in meeting the target, explaining that: Using international credits within an appropriate monitoring, reporting and verification framework is the right thing to do for the planet, allowing the UK to maximise the value of each pound spent on climate change mitigation. 29  The then Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industry Strategy subsequently reassured the House of Commons that the Government did “not intend to use” international credits: While we retain the ability in the Act to use international carbon credits that contribute to actions in other countries, we want them to take their own actions and we do not intend to use those credits. 30  However, some commentators, such as Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, have called for the use of international credits to be explicitly ruled out, in line with the CCC’s recommendation: The second door that has been left open is to the offshoring of our remaining emissions using international carbon credits. When I asked the Business Secretary to close that loophole earlier this month, he attempted to reassure me by saying that the Government would not be making use of these credits, but I am not reassured simply by those words. This Government might 27  28  29  30  Committee on Climate Change, Net Zero – The UK’s contribution to stopping global warming, 2 May 2019, p.17 Committee on Climate Change, Net Zero – The UK’s contribution to stopping global warming, 2 May 2019, p.21 Gov.uk press release, PM Theresa May: we will end UK contribution to climate change by 2050, 12 June 2019 (updated 19 June 2019) [accessed 24 June 2019] HC Deb 12 June 2019 Col 663  12 Net zero in the UK  have no intention of using international carbon credits, but who can say whether a new Administration in five years’ time—or, dare I say it, five weeks’ time—will share such scruples? 31  Cross-bench Peer Baroness Worthington took a different view, arguing that international credits could be used to go even further than the 100% target: However, the Government have not fully accepted all the advice from the Committee on Climate Change and have said that they do not rule out using international offsets to get to our target. I do not object to this if they are well done and well regulated, and it will make no practical difference in law, because we do not set out limits and offsets until 18 months before the start of any budgetary period. However, having deviated from the very clear advice of the CCC, we can now go even further than the 100% reduction target because it will be far cheaper and easier should we allow international offsets into this system. In meeting this goal, if we want to stay at the costs we have accepted—1% to 2% of GDP—we can go further. It opens up the opportunity to go into minus figures—minus 120% or minus 150%. This is now possible, and it would be the right thing to do. 32  3.3 International aviation and shipping The CCC recommended that the target should include the UK’s share of emissions from international aviation and shipping. To date the UK’s legally binding emissions reduction targets have not formally included such emissions but they have been taken into account by setting aside “headroom” within the carbon budgets. 33 Box 2: Action on international aviation and shipping emissions Together, international shipping (816MtCO2e in 2012 34) and aviation (895MtCO2e in 2018 35) are responsible for around 4-5% of global CO2 emissions. Without policies or new technologies to reduce emissions, these sectors are forecast to be responsible for an even larger share of total emissions in the future. Recognising this sizeable contribution to global emissions, the two UN agencies responsible for international aviation and shipping have resolved to find ways to reduce emissions in accordance with the Paris Agreement. • In 2016, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) reached an agreement to implement a global Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) system. CORSIA stipulates that airlines are obliged to offset their increases in emissions after 2020 by purchasing credits from projects that reduce emissions outside the aviation sector. • In April 2018, the International Maritime Organization adopted an “initial strategy” on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from ships. 36 This initial strategy set a target of reducing GHG emissions by at least 50% by 2050 with a strong emphasis by many countries on reducing this to 100% by 2050 wherever possible.  The Government press release was silent on international aviation and shipping but a Carbon Brief article analysing the new target quoted the 31 32 33 34 35  36  HC Deb 24 June 2019 Col 528 HL Deb 26 June Col 1098 See Library Briefing Paper on UK Carbon Budgets for further information.

However, there is a need for further analysis and international engagement through the appropriate frameworks. For now, therefore, we will continue to leave headroom for emissions from international aviation and shipping in carbon budgets to ensure that emissions reduction strategies for international aviation and shipping can be developed within International Maritime Organisation and International Civil Aviation Organisation frameworks at the appropriate pace, and so that the UK can remain on the right trajectory for net zero greenhouse gas emissions across the whole economy. 38  This approach was questioned by opposition MPs in the debate on the 2019 amendment Order, including the Labour Chair of the BEIS Committee: Other such areas are international aviation and shipping, which I am disappointed are not included in the SI we are debating today. The chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change, Chris Stark, who gave evidence to our Select Committee, said that it was absolutely imperative to include international aviation and shipping in our climate change commitments, because they contribute 10% of our carbon emissions. I hope the Government will look at that evidence again and update our legislation in light of it. 39  Labour Peer Lord Grantchester, who moved the Lords amendment to the motion referenced above, referred to the Explanatory Memorandum explanation as a “hollow commitment”: […] this is a hollow commitment, as the Government are already failing to abide with the fourth and fifth carbon budgets, which were drawn up within the pathway of reaching 80% carbon emissions reduction at 2 degrees of global warming. Let us state it again: this order is to reach 100% reductions to reach net zero at 1.5 degrees of warming. The latest, updated emissions projections from the department are that we are some 7% over the requirements for the fourth carbon budget and 13% over those for the fifth. What urgent steps are the Minister and the Government taking to get the UK back on track to meet the already-agreed carbon budgets? 40  3.4 Potential costs of net-zero The CCC stressed that the overall costs of reaching net zero by 2050 are “manageable but must be fairly distributed”. The Committee estimated the cost of meeting the net-zero target as 1-2% of GDP, the same as the previously predicted cost of the current 80% target, due to rapid 37  38  39 40  Carbon Brief, In-depth Q&A: The UK becomes the first major economy to set netzero climate goal, 12 June 2019 Explanatory Memorandum to the Climate Change Act 2008 (2050 Target Amendment) Order 2019, para 10.5 HC Deb 24 June 2019 Col 524 HL Deb 26 June 2019 Col 1088  14 Net zero in the UK  cost reductions in key technologies such as offshore wind. It also recommended that HM Treasury should review how the transition will be funded: HM Treasury should undertake a review of how the transition will be funded and where the costs will fall. It should develop a strategy to ensure this is, and is perceived to be, fair. A broader strategy will also be needed to ensure a just transition across society, with vulnerable workers and consumers protected. 41  Following the publication of the CCC’s net zero report there were press reports of a leaked letter from the then Chancellor of the Exchequer (Philip Hammond) warning the Prime Minister the new target would hurt public spending and could render key industries economically uncompetitive. The article highlighted the Chancellor’s concerns about the potential costs of “more than £1trn” to achieve netzero. 42 These concerns were contested as “simply incorrect” by a commentary piece by a visiting research fellow at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, which presents the findings of the Report to the Committee on Climate Change of the Advisory Group on Costs and Benefits of Net Zero as the evidence for this. 43 44 The potential economic impact of the proposed changes was picked up by the House of Lords Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee and debated in more detail in the House of Lords debate on the amendment Order. Some, such as Conservative peer Viscount Ridley, argued that the Treasury review should have been run before the amendment Order was debated and agreed. 45 On 2 November 2019, HM Treasury launched a Net Zero Review to “assess how the UK can maximise economic growth opportunities from its transformation to a green economy”. This included a priority to ensure a fair balance of contributions from all those who will benefit, including considering how to reduce costs for low income households. The Review will also consider how to avoid offshoring emissions i.e. how to reduce UK emissions without causing those emissions to be created by another country. A final report is expected in Autumn 2020. 46 On 5 June 2019, the House of Commons Treasury Committee launched an inquiry into the decarbonisation of the UK economy, scrutinising the role of HM Treasury, regulators and financial services firms in supporting the Government’s climate change commitments.

Policy actions to meet net zero 4.1 Progress so far The Chart below shows the UK’s net emissions, performance against existing carbon budgets and projections of emissions. The Climate Change Act 2008 has been a tool for driving down emissions in the UK as it sets a long-term legally binding emissions reduction target, as well as requiring interim five-yearly carbon budgets to be set. This Chart shows progress and budgets that were achieved and set before the net zero target was legislated for. The Committee on Climate Change is expected to publish its advice on the sixth carbon budget in September 2020, which will take into account the new net zero target. 48 Its call for evidence is open until 5 February 2020.  Sources: Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, Updated energy and emissions projections: 2018 (16 May 2019); Final UK greenhouse gas emissions national statistics: 1990-2017 (28 March 2019)  Further information on carbon budgets and the UK’s progression against them is set out in the Library Briefing paper on UK Carbon Budgets.  4.2 Commentary and debate The CCC emphasised that the target is “just the first step” and needs to be reinforced by credible UK policies. 49 The BEIS Secretary of State acknowledged this in his statement to the House of Commons on 12  48  49  Committee on Climate Change, CCC to publish Sixth Carbon Budget in September 2020, 17 October 2019 Committee on Climate Change, Response to Government plan to legislate for net Zero UK emissions target, 11 June 2019  17 Commons Library Briefing, 16 December 2019  June 2019, pointing to existing strategies in place (such as the Clean Growth Strategy) that form the foundations for the changes needed: In fulfilling the scale of the commitment we are making today, we will need technological and logistical changes in the way we use our land, with more emphasis, for example, on carbon sequestration. We will need to redouble our determination to seize the opportunity to support investment in a range of new technologies, including in areas such as carbon capture, usage and storage, and in hydrogen and bioenergy. However, as the committee also found, the foundations for these step changes are already in place, including in the industrial strategy and the clean growth strategy. Indeed, there is no reason whatever to fear that fulfilling this commitment will do anything to limit our success in the years ahead—quite the reverse. In our industrial strategy, we have backed technology and innovation, including the UK’s biggest ever increase in public investment in research and development. 50  Calls for concrete action were echoed in the House of Commons debate on 24 June 2019, including by Labour MP Ed Miliband: “if you will the end, you have to will the means” 51; and Conservative MP Peter Aldous: Other pieces of the jigsaw are missing, however, such as a route map for decarbonising transport, a flexible policy framework for promoting local bespoke heating schemes and a comprehensive plan for meeting the domestic energy efficiency targets in the clean growth strategy, as put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Truro and Falmouth (Sarah Newton) in her tenminute rule Bill last week. The UK has made significant strides in decarbonising the nation’s power supply, with offshore wind providing a means of regenerating coastal communities such as Lowestoft, but more work needs to be done, including providing a clear route to market for other clean energy technologies and getting on with delivering those big-ticket items of nuclear power and carbon capture, utilisation and storage, which are absolutely vital to delivering on the zero carbon goal. It is important for us not to be not a one-trick pony and concentrate only on power. We must immediately set about making significant strides in decarbonising transport and heat, as well as improving our performance in relation to energy efficiency. 52  The then interim Minister, Chris Skidmore, committed to an energy White Paper and a number of other documents and consultations to demonstrate forthcoming actions from the Government: My hon. Friend is right that the legislation today is not simply about warm words or passing a law. We need to be able to demonstrate the action that lies beneath it. Action will come relatively quickly with the publication of an energy White Paper in the summer that will look at the future of our energy supply, at a household level and an industrial level, and the energy network itself. The White Paper will demonstrate the action that the Government are taking and it will lead to a series of future consultations. 53  50 51 52 53  HC Deb 12 June 2019 Col 663 HC Deb 24 June 2019 Col 522 HC Deb 24 June 2019 Col 521 HC Deb 24 June 2019 Col 510  18 Net zero in the UK  The energy White Paper was not published before the general election.  4.3 Citizens’ Assembly On 20 June 2019, six Select Committees of the House of Commons 54 announced plans to hold a Citizen’s Assembly on combatting climate change and achieving the pathway to net zero carbon emissions. In early November 2019, some 30,000 invitations were sent across the UK to randomly selected households inviting people to join Climate Assembly UK. The project is being run by the House of Commons, with involve, Sortition Foundation and mySociety. The Climate Assembly will have over 100 members representative of the UK population and will meet over four weekends in early 2020. More information is available on the Climate Assembly UK webpages.  4.4 Removing emissions Net zero allows for emissions to be removed from the atmosphere to reach the 100% target. There are a number of ways that emissions can be removed from the atmosphere. Broadly speaking, these can be split into natural processes or technologies. A POST Note on Greenhous gas removal provides further discussion of the potential options.  Natural solutions The best-known natural approach is planting trees. Trees absorb and store CO2 from the air as they grow (see Box 1 for manifesto 2019 pledges to plant trees). Other natural solutions include restoring peatlands and restoring natural ecosystems (sometimes referred to as rewilding). Avoiding deforestation and destruction of existing ecosystems and peatland would also serve to ensure CO2 that is already stored in plants and the soil is safeguarded. Some natural solutions, such as rewilding and planting trees, can be controversial as they have been seen by some as conflicting with continued agricultural land use. 55 Farmers can currently voluntarily improve practices under an industry Greenhouse Gas Action Plan. Financial incentives could support farmers to act further and the Committee on Climate Change has called for England’s Farm Emissions Reduction Plan (due out in 2020) to include firm policies and an implementation plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture. The Conservative Government’s Agriculture Bill 2017-19 included measures to pay farmers for taking steps like reducing emissions or sequestering carbon. There was a House of Commons debate on an e-petition to “restore nature on a massive scale to help stop climate breakdown” on 28 October 2019. 56 The Government response to the petition included the following:  54  55  56  BEIS; Environmental Audit; Housing, Communities and Local Government; Science and Technology; Transport and Treasury Civil Society, Rewilding Britain pulls out of £3.4m project after concerns about its involvement, 22 October 2019 HC Deb 28 October 2019  19 Commons Library Briefing, 16 December 2019  Our woodlands and wetlands provide vital services, such as carbon sequestration and flood prevention that can help to mitigate climate change and help us adapt to its impacts. Tree planting is one of the main contributors to nature-based carbon sequestration and the Government supports this in a number of ways. Our manifesto committed to planting 11 million trees by 2022, and in addition a further 1 million trees in our towns and cities, and we also have a long term aspiration to increase woodland cover from 10% to 12% by 2060. To achieve these goals, in the Autumn Budget the Chancellor announced £10 million for an Urban Trees Challenge Fund and £50 million to help plant new woodlands through the Woodland Carbon Guarantee. Peatlands are our largest terrestrial carbon store. Drained peatlands release their carbon, adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Organic or peat soils make up 11% of England’s total land area, over 70% of which are drained or in poor condition. We have committed to publishing an England Peatland Strategy. The strategy will set out our vision to reverse decline in peatlands and restore them, which is in line with the Government's commitment to be the first generation to leave the natural environment of England in a better state than we found it. Work is underway on four large-scale peatland restoration projects across England, to which we have allocated £10 million, and will restore 5,851 ha of degraded peatlands. 57  Technologies There are a number of emerging technologies which remove emissions from the atmosphere which are at various stages of development. The most well-known is carbon capture and storage (CCS) which involves capturing CO2 and then transporting it to storage in deep geological formations. The CCC identify CCS as a “necessity not an option” to achieving the UK’s net zero target. 58 More recently carbon capture and usage (CCU) has been focused on. This involves capturing waste CO2 from power production and industrial processes, and using it in a broad number of economically productive ways such as: the production of chemicals, minerals, synthetic fuels, plastics, or as a solvent. Further information is available in the POST Briefing on Carbon Capture and Usage (2 November 2018).  57  58  UK Government and Parliament Petitions, Closed petition: Restore nature on a massive scale to help stop climate breakdown.

[4. 2019_Threats] Threats Presented by Climate Change Debate on 24 January 2019 Summary On 24 January 2019, the House of Lords is scheduled to debate a motion moved by Lord Teverson (Liberal Democrat) on the “threats presented by climate change”. This briefing considers risks arising from climate change—identified as increasing at both global and national level—and summarises recent coordination efforts and programmes intended to mitigate them. International bodies charged with examining the scientific evidence have identified risks associated with: • • • •  changing weather; rising sea levels; land and marine-based biodiversity and ecosystems; and human systems such as health, security and the economy.  Negotiations on how to meet these challenges have continued, most recently at a United Nations summit in Katowice, Poland, held in December 2018. The UK has identified several priority climate risk areas including: • • • • • •  flooding and coastal change; health, wellbeing and productivity; water supply shortages; natural ecosystems, soils and biodiversity; food production and trade; and new and emerging pests and diseases.  A selection of recommended reading, including detailed evidence reports, is identified at the end of the briefing for further information on this broad and evolving subject. Introduction It is widely held within the scientific and international policy-making communities that emissions generated from human activity have affected the Earth’s climate in recent decades. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)—the United Nations body charged with assessing the science related to climate change—has concluded that there is “clear” evidence that the climate has warmed since the 1950s and that the dominant cause of such temperature increases is “extremely likely” to have been greenhouse gas emissions resulting from human activity. In a 2014 report summarising the scientific evidence available at that time, the IPCC stated: Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes 1 Thomas Brown | 17 January 2019  2  are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, and [the] sea level has risen. Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have increased since the pre-industrial era, driven largely by economic and population growth, and are now higher than ever. This has led to atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide that are unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years. Their effects, together with those of other anthropogenic drivers, have been detected throughout the climate system and are extremely likely to have been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.1 In respect of the scientific consensus behind climate change—widely defined as a large-scale, long-term shift in the planet’s weather patterns and average temperatures, including climate system warming—the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has observed that “97% of climate scientists agree that climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities, and most of the leading scientific organisations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position”.2 It should be noted, however, that questions relating to climate change, including in respect of causes, remedies or its very existence as a phenomenon, remain contested by some observers and have become increasingly politicised in recent years. ‘Climate scepticism’ spans a range of viewpoints, and includes individuals or groups of people who are sceptical that the world is warming; the influence of humans in climate warming; the pace and extent of the impacts of climate change; and/or whether urgent action and spending are necessary to address changes in the climate.3 Climate Change as a Global Challenge The very nature of climate change means that its effects are global in scope. In 2015, an international agreement was reached at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in which 195 nations committed to “‘holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels”.4 This agreement is widely known as the Paris agreement after the city in which the COP21 meeting was held. Following the adoption of the Paris agreement, the UNFCCC invited the IPCC to produce a special report on the environmental and societal effects of a global temperature rise of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.5 The IPCC agreed and published this special report in October 2018. It noted that human activities were estimated to have caused approximately 1°C of global warming above pre-industrial levels and predicted that, on current trends, this was likely to reach 1.5°C between 2030 and 2052.6 The authors of the report used available scientific evidence and models to identify the impacts that such an elevated rise would have globally. They noted that the level of future climate-related risks for natural and human systems would depend on the “magnitude and rate of warming, geographic location, levels of development and vulnerability, and on the choices and implementation of adaptation and mitigation options”.7 Having noted this caveat, the report identified a series of risk factors associated with a 1.5°C global warming model, in line with the ambitions outlined in the Paris agreement. Differences in Regional Climate Characteristics First, the IPCC report identified that a warmer climate was likely to increase the risk of extreme weather in different regions. According to the authors of the report, regional climate differences in a 1.5°C global warming scenario would include higher mean temperatures in most land and ocean regions; hot extremes in most inhabited regions; heavy precipitation in several regions; and the probability of  3  drought and precipitation deficits in some regions. In particular, the number of hot days was projected to increase in most land regions, with the highest increases in regions located in the tropics.8 Global Sea Level Rise Second, the report noted that an increase in global temperatures was likely to lead to higher sea levels. The authors cited projections suggesting that a 1.5°C rise in temperatures would result in a 0.26 to 0.77 metre global mean sea level rise by 2100. Sea levels were likely to continue to rise beyond this date, and marine ice sheet instability in Antarctica and/or an irreversible loss of the Greenland ice sheet “could result in multi-metre rise in sea level over hundreds to thousands of years”. The authors contended that increased warming “amplifies the exposure of small islands, low-lying coastal areas and deltas to the risks associated with sea level rise for many human and ecological systems, including increased saltwater intrusion, flooding and damage to infrastructure”.9 Land-based Biodiversity and Ecosystems Third, the report cited estimates, based on studies of 105,000 species, that 6% of insects, 8% of plants and 4% of vertebrates were projected to lose over half of their climatically determined geographic range in a 1.5°C global warming scenario. Other noted risks from increased temperatures for land-based biodiversity and ecosystems included a higher risk of forest fires; spread of invasive species; and permafrost thaw. Also noted as a potential risk was the transformation of ecosystems from one type to another—with high-latitude tundra and boreal forests identified as at risk of “climate change-induced degradation and loss”.10 Marine Biodiversity, Fisheries, and Ecosystems Fourth, the report noted that warming of 1.5°C was expected to result in continued increases in ocean temperature as well as associated increases in ocean acidity and decreases in ocean oxygen levels. In a 1.5°C warming scenario, evidence cited suggested that: • • • •  one sea ice-free Arctic summer would be likely per century; the ranges of many marine species would move to higher latitudes; an increase in damage to many marine ecosystems could be expected, including coral reefs and other coastal ecosystems; and ocean acidification caused by increasing carbon dioxide concentrations would “amplify” the adverse effects of warming, including the relative abundance and/or survival of a broad range of species.  In addition, the authors argued that climate change was likely to continue affecting fisheries and aquaculture. They cited a model suggesting that the global fisheries catch could decrease by “about 1.5 million tonnes” should global temperatures rise by 1.5°C.11 Human Systems Fifth, the report observed that climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security and economic growth were projected to increase in a 1.5°C global warming scenario. The authors added that disadvantaged and vulnerable populations, some indigenous peoples, and local communities dependent on agricultural or coastal livelihoods were at a “disproportionately higher risk  4  of adverse consequences”. Additionally, “poverty and disadvantage” were expected to increase in some populations as global temperatures increased. Other noted risks included: • • • •  potential increases in heat-related morbidity and mortality; potential net reductions in yields of crops such as maize, rice and wheat and potential reductions in the nutritional quality of rice and wheat; climate change-induced increases in water stress; and economic growth-related risks, particularly for countries in the tropics and southern hemisphere subtropics.12  Limits to Adaptation and Adaptive Capacity Lastly, the report noted that a wide range of adaptation options were available to reduce risks in particular areas. These included: • • •  ecosystem restoration and biodiversity management for risks associated with natural and managed ecosystems; coastal defences as a tool to mitigate against rising sea levels; and options including efficient irrigation and green infrastructure to address issues relating to health, livelihoods, food, water, and economic growth.  However, the authors noted that there was evidence to suggest that limits to adaptive capacity existed in a 1.5°C warming scenario, and that such limits, though varying by sector, became “more pronounced at higher levels of warming”.13 Two further IPCC special reports—focused on how climate change affects the oceans and cryosphere and the use of land, respectively—are expected to be published later this year.14 Ongoing International Response The October 2018 IPCC report concluded that limiting global warming to 1.5°C with “no or limited overshoot” would require “rapid and far-reaching transitions in energy, land, urban and infrastructure (including transport and buildings) and industrial systems”.15 Global net human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide would need to fall by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching “net zero” around 2050.16 The report added that to achieve this “systems transitions” would have to be “unprecedented in terms of scale, but not necessarily in terms of speed, and imply deep emissions reductions in all sectors, a wide portfolio of mitigation options and a significant upscaling of investments in those options”.17 However, the report noted that the international community was not on track to limit warming to 1.5°C on current plans. It observed forecasts suggesting that those mitigation measures currently announced to be in place up to 2030 were likely to lead to significantly higher global warming of about 3°C by 2100, with further warming continuing afterwards.18 At the most recent COP—COP24 held in Katowice, Poland, between 2 and 15 December 2018— signatories to the UNFCCC sought to secure agreement on how international action to mitigate climate change could be strengthened.19 The conference concluded with the adoption by all parties to the convention, including the United States and China, of a single rulebook that will apply to all countries in relation to emissions reporting and climate targets to facilitate practical implementation of the Paris agreement to limit the increase in global average temperatures to below 2°C above pre-industrial levels.20 Claire Perry, Minister of State for Energy and Clean Growth at the Department for Business,  5  Energy and Industrial Strategy, summarised the UK Government’s assessment of this outcome in a written statement following the conference: COP24 was an important moment, representing the culmination of three years of negotiations and following shortly after the publication of a landmark scientific report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that highlighted the severe consequences of failing to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. In the negotiations we succeeded in securing our main objectives by delivering an operational rulebook to drive genuine climate action, creating a level-playing field, while allowing for flexibility and support for those countries that need it, in light of capacity. Inevitably there is still work to be done, particularly on carbon markets, but the overall picture is of a rulebook that enables the Paris Agreement to be taken forward in practice, marking a move from negotiation to implementation.21 In a statement issued at the conclusion of COP24, Lord Stern of Brentford (Crossbench), chair of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science, commented that the conference had “ultimately succeeded in its crucial primary task of agreeing the so-called rule book for the Paris agreement”. He added that, in his view, countries “must now get on with the crucial implementation of their contributions to the Paris agreement” and plan how to “increase their reductions in emissions to allow them to submit stronger commitments” ahead of the expected COP26 meeting in 2020. He argued that the progress the world was currently making was “inadequate given the scale and urgency of the risks we face”.22 The UN Secretary General, António Guterres, characterised the COP24 agreement on a rulebook to implement the Paris agreement as the “basis for a transformative process which will require strengthened ambition from the international community”.23 Mr Guterres will host a climate summit in September 2019 to facilitate international efforts to mitigate climate change.24 Climate Change as a Domestic Challenge As well as being global in scope, climate change can affect particular regions and countries in different ways. The UK Government’s view is that there is “clear evidence to show that climate change is happening” and that the UK is “already affected by rising temperatures”.25 The Climate Change Act 2008 sets out the framework in which the UK approaches climate change.26 The act commits the Government to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% of 1990 levels by 2050 through a system of carbon budgets that restrict the volume of greenhouse gases that can be legally emitted over a five-year period.27 The act also established the independent Committee on Climate Change, which advises the Government on how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over time.28 The committee is currently chaired by Lord Deben (Conservative). Baroness Brown of Cambridge (Crossbench) serves as the committee’s deputy chair and chairs the separate adaptation subcommittee, which provides independent advice on preparing for and adapting to climate change.29 In June 2018, the committee cautioned that although emissions had fallen by 43% from 1990 levels, the Government was “not on course to meet the legally binding fourth and fifth carbon budgets”.30 In July 2016, the Committee on Climate Change published a synthesis report produced by its adaptation sub-committee, then chaired by Lord Krebs (Crossbench), to inform a government climate change risk assessment then due in January 2017.31 The synthesis report concluded that changes to the UK climate were “likely to include periods of too much or too little water, increasing average and extreme temperatures and sea level rise”.32 The report identified 56 individual risks and opportunities arising  6  from global warming, organised within four urgency categories.33 In particular, it identified six “interrelated” and “urgent” climate change risks facing the UK. These priority risks, together with the committee’s headline observation and urgency rating for each, are set out below.34 Priority Risk Area Flooding and coastal change risks to communities, businesses and infrastructure Risks to health, wellbeing and productivity from high temperatures Risk of shortages in the public water supply, and for agriculture, energy generation and industry, with impacts on freshwater ecology  Risks to natural capital, including terrestrial, coastal, marine and freshwater ecosystems, soils and biodiversity  Risks to domestic and international food production and trade New and emerging pests and diseases, and invasive non-native species, affecting people, plants and animals  Headline Observation “The impacts of flooding and coastal change in the UK are already significant and expected to increase as a result of climate change”. “Heatwaves in the UK like that experienced in 2003 are expected to become the norm in summer by the 2040s”. “Climate change is projected to reduce the amount of water in the environment that can be sustainably withdrawn whilst increasing the demand for irrigation during the driest months. At the same time the growing population will create additional demands on already stretched resources in some parts of the country”. “Climate change presents a substantial risk to the UK’s native wildlife and to the vital goods and services provided by natural capital, including food, timber and fibre, clean water, carbon storage, and the cultural benefits derived from landscapes”. “The affordability of food for the UK population is subject to domestic and international risks affecting production and prices”. “The impacts of new and emerging pests and diseases are potentially high for otherwise healthy people, animals and plants. The warmer, wetter conditions expected with climate change will allow some pests and diseases to extend their range”.  Conclusion More action needed (highest urgency rating) More action needed (highest urgency rating) More action needed (highest urgency rating)  More action needed (highest urgency rating)  More action needed (highest urgency rating) Research priority (second-highest urgency rating)  Government Policy In January 2017, the Government published a climate change risk assessment in line with its obligations under the Climate Change Act 2008. This drew on the report commissioned from the Committee on Climate Change’s adaptation sub-committee. The Government endorsed the six priority risk areas identified in this earlier report and broadly endorsed the urgency level given to individual risks identified, with the exception of some relating to food security.35 It provided details of actions being taken in each risk area, adding that further details of adaptation measures would be published in 2018.36 Following the 2017 climate change risk assessment, in July 2018 the Government published its most recent national adaptation programme (NAP) and strategy for climate adaptation reporting. This document set out over 100 “key actions” for the 2018–2023 period, including actions intended to: • • •  protect ecosystems, such as ancient and native woodland and marine areas; establish or maintain various environmental schemes and networks; and update climate change-related plans and guidance, amongst many other measures.  7  The Government said that the document was “intended to communicate the extent, nature and immediacy of different climate risks and what we are doing to address them, which will help inform a more mature debate on how we adapt as a society”.37 The Committee on Climate Change’s adaptation sub-committee is expected to publish a report evaluating the Government’s progress on implementing the NAP in June 2019.38 However, in an article published on the same day as the NAP was published, Kathryn Brown, Head of Adaptation at the Committee on Climate Change Secretariat, contended that the NAP appeared to be only a “partial plan” and that it was “hard to say at this stage” whether the programme was “sustainable and effective”.39 She added: The main risks we have highlighted—flooding and coastal change, high temperatures, water shortages and many others—are centre-stage in the opening pages of the new NAP. But only some of the relevant urgent risks are dealt with in the list of actions in the report. Of the 56 risks and opportunities we have previously identified, a quick count shows that 27 are missing from the list of actions, including 16 urgent risks. Diving into the content, we have previously raised the risks to the UK from climate change impacts abroad. But there are no actions in the NAP to help manage these risks, with the exception of an honourable mention of the Food Security Strategy. Another key gap is around actions to manage the transition period ahead of the withdrawal of ‘Flood Re’, which helps people who live in flood risk areas to get affordable home insurance. The implications of removing this scheme are profound for those living in flood risk areas. And in many other cases the actions the Government identifies in response to the risks are not new: many are based on work that has been underway for several years. In particular, actions to reduce the risks to people from overheating in homes, which was one of the highest priority risks identified in the [2017] climate change risk assessment, are absent.40 In a speech delivered in November 2018 to mark the launch of the Met Office’s UK climate projections 2018 analysis tool, Michael Gove, Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, commented further on the impact of climate change on everyday life and the Government’s climaterelated plans.41 He referred to the UK climate projections tool showing that, in a high emission scenario, average summer temperatures could be up to 5.4°C warmer across the UK by 2070. The Environment Agency has stated that such an increase would be likely to lead to an increased risk of drought and an increase in heat-related morbidity and mortality rates, amongst other effects.42 The projections had also shown that average summer rainfall could decrease by up to 47%, while winters could be up to 4.2°C warmer and there could be up to 35% more precipitation in winter, resulting in flooding and other issues, by the same year.43 Mr Gove stated that flood defence work, amongst other activity, had been informed by such projections. In respect of internationally coordinated action, he added that the UK was “leading international efforts on climate resilience” ahead of the UN climate summit in 2019. The Government has commissioned the Committee on Climate Change to produce a new evidence report, due to be published in 2021, to support the next climate change risk assessment. This study is expected to be supported by new research, including projects on future water availability; flooding; how climate-related risks interact; and how behavioural change can affect climate risks and opportunities.44 Leaving the European Union In 2017, the House of Lords European Union Committee observed that UK climate change policy had, in recent years, “become increasingly enmeshed in EU policy”.45 For example, the UK participates in the  8  EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) set up in 2005.46 Both the UK and EU are parties to the UNFCCC and the Paris agreement.47 However, it is not yet clear whether the UK will continue to participate in EU climate mitigation initiatives such as the EU ETS following its withdrawal from the EU, and to what extent the UK and EU will cooperate on other climate change-related policies and mitigation mechanisms in the future.48 Further Information • • • • • •  1  United Nations, ‘Climate Change’, accessed 15 January 2019; and ‘Climate Change: A Global Issue—Major Reports’, accessed 15 January 2019 IPCC, ‘Reports’, accessed 15 January 2019 Committee on Climate Change, ‘Publications’, accessed 15 January 2019; and ‘Implications of the Vote to Leave the EU’, accessed 15 January 2019 House of Commons Library, Brexit: Energy and Climate Change, 9 November 2018 House of Lords Library, Leaving the European Union: UK Climate Change Policy, 15 June 2017 House of Lords European Union Committee, Brexit: Environment and Climate Change, 14 February 2017, HL Paper 109 of session 2016–17; and Government Response, April 2017  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Climate Change 2014: Synthesis Report—Headline Statements from the Summary for Policymakers, 5 November 2014, p 1.

The Government is required to consider—but not follow—the advice of the Committee on Climate Change (CCC, also created under the 2008 Act) when setting these budgets. The headline target of the Act was amended in June 2019 to reflect the Government’s net zero ambitions. The aim is to meet the 2008 Act’s target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 100% by 2050 compared to 1990 levels. Carbon budgets 1, 2, 3 and 4 The first three budgets are for the following five-year periods: 2008-12, 2013-17 and 2018-22. These budgets were set in May 2009 and implemented via the Carbon Budgets Order 2009. The fourth carbon budget (2023-2027) was set at 1,950 MtCO2e and implemented via the Carbon Budget Order 2011. Setting the fifth carbon budget The CCC’s proposals for the Fifth Carbon Budget were published in November 2015, recommending a budget on a cost-effective path to a then 2050 target of an 80% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990 levels. The CCC proposed the budget should be set at 1,765 MtCO2e for 2028-2032 (or 1,725 MtCO2e if international shipping emissions were excluded), which would equate to a 57% reduction in emissions compared to 1990 levels. The UK Government agreed the fifth Carbon Budget at 1,725 MtCO2e, passing the Carbon Budget Order 2016 in July 2016. The Government published its Clean Growth Strategy in October 2017, setting out a “possible pathway” for meeting the fifth carbon budget. The CCC’s independent assessment of the Strategy (January 2018) praised the Government’s strong commitment to achieving the UK’s climate targets, but called on the Government to close the gaps it identified in meeting the fourth and fifth carbon budgets. Furthermore, the CCC’s Progress Report to Parliament in June 2018 called on the Government to bring forward new fully funded policies to ensure the fourth and fifth carbon budget are met. Progress in meeting carbon budgets The first carbon budget (2008-2012) was outperformed by one per cent and official statistics indicated that the second budget (2013-2017) was outperformed by around 14%. The Government’s energy and emissions projections 2018 (published April 2019) predicted that the third carbon budget would be outperformed by around 3% but (taking into account existing and new policies and proposals) predicted a projected shortfall of around 6% and 10% against the fourth and fifth budgets respectively. In the Clean Growth Strategy, the Government confirmed that it may consider using flexibilities available to it on when and how to reduce UK emissions on route to 2050, but that it would obtain the advice of CCC and consult the devolved Administrations before making a decision. The CCC does not support the use of outperformance being carried over to help meet later budgets.  Number CBP7555, 9 July 2019  1. Carbon Budgets 1.1 What does the Climate Change Act 2008 require? The Climate Change Act 2008 (the 2008 Act) initially established long term statutory targets for the UK to achieve at least a 34% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 and an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 against a 1990 baseline. Since the 2008 Act became law, the UK ratified the Paris Agreement with more ambitious aims to limit global temperature increase (see further in section 4.1 below). Following advice from the Committee on Climate Change (CCC, the independent statutory body set up to monitor and advise on progress towards the 2050 climate targets) the Government amended the 2050 target to reflect more ambitious aims in June 2019.1 The target was increased to 100% (net zero) from a previous 80% target.2 Further information on this amendment is available in the Library Briefing Paper on Legislating for net zero (12 June 2019). Under the 2008 Act, the Government must set five-yearly carbon budgets, twelve years in advance, from 2008 to 2050. The Government is required to consider—but not follow—the advice of the CCC when setting these budgets. The CCC is also required to publish an annual progress report to Parliament and the devolved legislatures on the progress that has been made towards meeting the carbon budgets and the 2050 target, the further progress that is needed to meet those targets, and whether or not the budgets and target are likely to be met.  1.2 Devolved Administrations The devolved Administrations have their own targets to reduce emissions and also contribute to the UK’s overall progress towards meeting carbon budgets. The CCC also provides advice to the devolved legislatures on carbon budgets and targets and reports on progress. The CCC’s 2018 Progress Report to Parliament stated that: Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland together accounted for 22% of UK emissions in 2016 (8%, 10%, and 4% respectively), while they account for 16% of the UK’s population and 13% of economic output measured by GVA.3  Each devolved nation has varying levels of devolved powers in areas related to emissions reduction, but key areas of devolved responsibility include: transport, agriculture, land use, energy efficiency and waste.  1 2 3  CCC, Net Zero - The UK’s contribution to stopping global warming, 2 May 2019 The Climate Change Act 2008 (2050 Target Amendment) Order 2019 CCC, 2018 Progress Report to Parliament, Note: Emissions data for each devolved administration is produced one year later than the UK-wide data. The CCC use the recently published data for 2016, unlike the rest of the Progress Report which is mainly based on 2017 data.  4  5  UK Carbon Budgets  Detailed information on the devolved Administrations progress in reducing emissions and the CCC’s work and advice to each of the governments is set out in the CCC’s 2018 Progress Report to Parliament (Chapter 9).  Scotland Scotland has its own Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 which set a longterm target to achieve an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 against a 1990 baseline, with an interim target of 42% reduction by 2020. These targets include Scotland’s share of emissions from international aviation and shipping. The Scottish Parliament sets annual targets in secondary legislation at least 12 years in advance. The Scottish Government published its climate change plan in February 2018 which sets out how it plans to meet Scottish climate change targets to 2032. The Climate Change (Emissions Reduction Targets) (Scotland) Bill was introduced to Scottish Parliament on 23 May 2018 and includes a more ambitious 2045 target of a 100% reduction on 1990 emissions, reflecting the CCC’s May 2019 net zero advice.4 If passed, the Bill will amend the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009. The Scottish Parliament’s Environment Committee voted in favour of this target on 18 June 2019.5 More information is available on the Scottish Government webpages on climate change, including a progress page on the new Climate Change Bill.  Wales The Environment (Wales) Act 2016 places a duty on Welsh Ministers to ensure at least an 80% emissions reduction from 1990 levels in 2050 and five-yearly carbon budgets. The Climate Change (Carbon Budgets) (Wales) Regulations 2018 were passed in December 2018 and set the first two carbon budgets for Wales. Following the CCC’s May 2019 advice on net zero,6 the Welsh Minister for Environment, Energy and Rural Affairs announced that the Welsh Government will bring regulations before the Assembly in 2020 on a net zero by 2050 target for Wales.7 Further information is available on the Welsh Government webpages on climate change, including a page on reducing Welsh emissions.  Northern Ireland Northern Ireland does not currently have its own long-term target for emissions but is included within UK targets. Northern Ireland has a draft Programme for Government that contains indicators for future emissions reductions. Further information is available on the Northern Ireland Executive pages on climate change.  4 5 6 7  CCC, Net Zero - The UK’s contribution to stopping global warming, 2 May 2019 Scottish Government, Climate Change Bill [accessed 8 July 2019] CCC, Net Zero - The UK’s contribution to stopping global warming, 2 May 2019 Welsh Government, Wales accepts Committee on Climate Change 95% emissions reduction target, 11 June 2019 [accessed 8 July 2019]  Number CBP7555, 9 July 2019  1.3 UK carbon budgets 1-3 The first three budgets run from 2008-12, 2013-17 and 2018-22. These budgets were set in May 2009 and implemented via the Carbon Budgets Order 2009. They were set as follows based on the advice of the CCC:  Carbon budgets  Budget 1  Budget 2  Budget 3  (2008-12)  (2013–17)  (2018–22)  3018  2782  2544  25  31  37 by 2020  (MtCO2e)8 Percentage reduction below 1990 levels  The carbon budget is set out as an average percentage reduction compared to 1990 levels and as the resulting total emissions for the whole five-year period. Gov.uk guidance on carbon budgets and the CCC’s webpage on Carbon budgets: how we monitor emissions targets contain further resources on each of the UK’s carbon budgets.9 10  1.4 The fourth carbon budget In line with the main recommendation from the CCC, the fourth carbon budget (2023-2027) was set at 1,950 MtCO2e and implemented via the Carbon Budget Order 2011. While announcing the fourth budget, the then Minister (Chris Huhne) also made clear that the budget would be reviewed by 2014.11 This intention to review the budget within three years of accepting it (in light of whether or not the EU committed to a 30% reduction in emissions) was criticised by the Environmental Audit Committee in its report on Carbon Budgets published in October 2011: A review of the carbon budgets threatens to undermine the benefit of the Climate Change Act, producing uncertainty about the trajectory for emissions reductions upon which key Government policies will be formulated and technologies developed. 12  The Government commissioned the CCC to carry out the review, which it did in 2013, publishing its conclusions in December 2013. The Committee  8  9 10 11  12  Metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) is the unit of measurement used. The unit CO2e represents an amount of a greenhouse gas whose atmospheric impact has been standardised to that of one unit mass of carbon dioxide, based on the global warming potential of the gas. Gov.uk, Carbon Budgets, last updated 22 July 2016 CCC, Carbon budgets: how we monitor emissions targets [accessed 20 February 2019] DECC, Fourth Carbon Budget: oral ministerial statement by The Rt Hon Chris Huhne MP 17 May 2011, 17 May 2011 EAC, Carbon Budgets, 7th Report Session 2010-12, HC 1080, October 2011  6  7  UK Carbon Budgets  concluded that there was no basis for scaling back targets and argued for early action: There has been no change in the circumstances upon which the fourth carbon budget (2023 – 2027) was originally set in 2011 that would justify a lowering of ambition. (…) The report compares a strategy of reducing emissions through the 2020s with one where action is delayed until the 2030s. It shows that there are significant savings associated with early action (e.g. over £100 billion in present value terms under assumptions that the gas price remains at the current level, with much higher savings in a world with a high gas price). The only situation where early action would be more costly is if there were to be a combination of a low carbon price and low fossil fuel prices. This would be counter to UN ambition and to expectations for the oil and gas markets. 13  1.5 Setting the fifth carbon budget The CCC’s proposals for the Fifth Carbon Budget were published in November 2015 recommending a budget on a cost-effective path to the 2050 target. CCC’s recommendation to the Government was that the target for the fifth carbon budget (2028 to 2032) should be set at 1,765 MtCO2e, including emissions from international shipping. This would equate to an average 57% reduction in emissions compared to 1990 levels. The CCC noted that on the current accounting basis (i.e. if international aviation and shipping emissions were excluded) then an emission limit of 1,725 MtCO2e would be appropriate over the 2028-2032 period: 1. The budget. The fifth carbon budget should be set at 1,765 MtCO2e for 2028-2032, including emissions from international shipping. On the current accounting basis (i.e. excluding emissions from international aviation and shipping), the budget would be 1,725 MtCO2e. 2. International aviation. Emissions from international aviation should continue to be allowed for by setting the budget on the path to meeting the 2050 target with international aviation emissions included. However, the accounting for these emissions remains uncertain, so they should not be formally included in the fifth carbon budget. 3. Credits. The budget should be met without the use of international carbon units (i.e. credits) outside the EU Emissions Trading System. If unexpected circumstances mean the budget cannot be met costeffectively without recourse to purchase of credits, the Committee would revisit this advice, including an assessment of the strength and validity of the credit market at that time. Credits could also be used to go beyond the proposed budget to support international action to reduce emissions. 4. Policy: low-carbon power. The Government should develop policy approaches consistent with reducing carbon intensity of the power  13  CCC, CCC concludes that there is no basis to change the fourth carbon budget – 11 December 2013  Number CBP7555, 9 July 2019  sector to below 100 gCO2/kWh in 2030 (compared to 450 gCO2/kWh in 2014 and 200-250 gCO2/kWh expected by 2020). 5. Policy: other sectors. For sectors outside the EU Emissions Trading System the Government should develop policies to drive an average rate of emissions reduction of 2% (6 MtCO2e) per year from 2014 to 2030. The Carbon Accounting Regulations should be set to ensure that emissions from these sectors are limited to 1,175 MtCO2e over 2028-2032 (1,135 MtCO2e excluding emissions from international shipping), which is the Committee’s best estimate of the costeffective path to the statutory 2050 target. 14  The Committee set out some of its thinking behind the recommendations in a 2016 blog post: The basic premise behind the Committee’s advice is that the budget should follow the lowest cost path to the long-term target. That lowest cost path is likely to involve steady action, avoid stop-start investment and ensure sufficient lead time for making more difficult changes. That has been the clear message from the Committee’s extensive discussions with businesses and other stakeholders. It is also borne out by the analytical evidence set out in the Committee’s reports. By following that steady-action path, the Committee’s recommended budget best satisfies the multiple criteria, including affordability, competitiveness and security of supply, laid out in the Climate Change Act.15  The UK Government accepted the CCC’s advice and agreed the fifth Carbon Budget at 1,725 MtCO2e (excluding international shipping and aviation emissions from the formal total for the budget). According to the 2008 Act, the fifth carbon budget should have been set no later than 30 June 2016.16 The draft Carbon Budget Order 2016 was laid before the House on 30 June 2016. It was subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. The Carbon Budget Order 2016 was made 20 July 2016 and came into force on 21 July 2016.17  International shipping and aviation emissions International aviation and shipping emissions are not currently included in the UK’s carbon budgets, nor are they explicitly included in the Paris Agreement. However, the UK’s long-term target of at least a 100% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for 2050 (compared to 1990 levels) covers all sectors, including international aviation and shipping.18 The CCC’s recommendation on net zero stated that it is “essential” that a commitment to net zero by 2050 is comprehensive and covers international aviation and shipping.19 The Government’s views on including international  14  15  16 17 18  19  CCC, The fifth carbon budget – The next step towards a low-carbon economy, November 2015: page 12 Mike Thompson, CCC, The fifth carbon budget – a balanced path to a necessary goal, 31 March 2016 Section 4 of the Climate Change Act 2008. The Carbon Budget Order 2016, SI 2016/785 See: CCC, Building a zero carbon economy – Call for Evidence [accessed 20 February 2019] CCC, Net Zero - The UK’s contribution to stopping global warming, 2 May 2019  8  9  UK Carbon Budgets  aviation and shipping emissions in the net zero target were set out in June 2019 as follows: The Government recognises that international aviation and shipping have a crucial role to play in reaching net zero emissions globally. However, there is a need for further analysis and international engagement through the appropriate frameworks. For now, therefore, we will continue to leave headroom for emissions from international aviation and shipping in carbon budgets to ensure that emissions reduction strategies for international aviation and shipping can be developed within International Maritime Organisation and International Civil Aviation Organisation frameworks at the appropriate pace, and so that the UK can remain on the right trajectory for net zero greenhouse gas emissions across the whole economy. 20  This is further discussed in the Library Briefing Paper on Legislating for net zero (27 June 2019). Further information on the CCC’s views on UK aviation are set out in its aviation letter from February 2019. The (then) Energy and Climate Change Select Committee21 published a report, Setting the Fifth Carbon Budget, in April 2016 in which it supported the CCC’s recommendation that the fifth budget should be broadened to include shipping emissions and that progress and international developments on aviation emissions should be kept under review. The 2015 Government did not agree to include international shipping emissions in carbon budgets: The Government has considered the CCC recommendation and has come to the conclusion that it is not the appropriate time for the inclusion of international shipping emissions in carbon budgets. A decision to include international shipping emissions in carbon budgets at this stage could be seen as the UK taking unilateral policy action on this issue, which could undermine our ability to achieve a global solution within the International Maritime Organization (IMO)—our preferred approach to dealing with these emissions.22  Shipping is regulated by the UN body, the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Since the fifth carbon budget was set, in April 2018, the IMO agreed the first ever international shipping emissions reduction target as part of a wider climate deal for the shipping sector. The main target is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% by 2050, compared to 2008 levels. The agreement also calls for emissions to be phased out completely, but without a timeframe.23 CO2 emissions from aviation have been included in the EU emissions trading system (EU ETS) since 2012, encompassing all airlines operating in Europe. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) agreed a Resolution in 20  21  22  23  Explanatory Memorandum to the Climate Change Act 2008 (2050 Target Amendment) Order 2019, para 10.5 On 10 October 2016 the House of Commons approved changes to Standing Orders to establish a Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee with a remit covering the energy and climate change brief. Energy and Climate Change Committee reports are archived.

It aims to stabilise CO2 emissions at 2020 levels by requiring airlines to offset the growth of their emissions after 2020.24 This policy has an end date of 2035 and the Government has committed to negotiate in the ICAO for a long-term goal for global international aviation emissions that is consistent with the Paris Agreement. The CCC has welcomed this commitment, stating that: A new long-term objective would provide a strong and early signal to incentivise the investment in new, cleaner, technologies that will be required for the sector to play its role in meeting long-term targets. This is particularly important in aviation given the long lifetimes of assets.25  More information on both these approaches is available on the European Commission pages on Climate Action: reducing emissions from aviation.  24  25  See: Gov.uk press release, UK secures historic deal to combat global aviation emissions, 6 October 2016 [accessed 20 February 2019] CCC, Aviation letter from Lord Deben to Chris Grayling, 12 February 2019 [accessed 20 February 2019]  11 UK Carbon Budgets  2. Policies for meeting the fifth carbon budget 2.1 Publication of the Clean Growth Strategy The Climate Change Act 2008 requires the Secretary of State to publish a report setting out an indicative annual range for the net UK carbon account for each year within a carbon budget; and a report setting out the Government’s proposals and policies for meeting the carbon budgets for the current and future budgetary periods (sections 12 and 14 of the 2008 Act). In response to a PQ in January 2016, the then Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change (Amber Rudd) committed to publish an Emission Reduction Plan before the end of the year.26 It was subsequently renamed the Clean Growth Plan and then the Clean Growth Strategy. The Clean Growth Strategy was published by Government to meet the requirements of section 12 and 14 of the Climate Change Act 2008 on 12 October 2017.27 The Government received criticism for the publication delay, particularly in relation to the requirement under the 2008 Act which requires that the plan is published “as soon as is reasonably practicable after making an order to setting the carbon budget”.28 In the executive summary to the Strategy, the Government highlighted the different sectors it focused on: We have achieved significant results in the power and waste sectors and now need to replicate this success across the economy, particularly in the transport, business and industrial sectors. We also need to reduce the emissions created by heating our homes and businesses, which account for almost a third of UK emissions. 29  The Strategy also notes that the 25-year environment plan would also contain details of future actions. The Library Briefing Paper on the 25 year environment plan (17 January 2018) provides further information on the content of the plan.  2.2 Meeting the fourth and fifth carbon budgets In order to meet the fourth (2023-2027) and fifth carbon budgets (20282032) the Government stated that it needed to “drive a significant acceleration in the pace of decarbonisation” and set out domestic policies that “keep us on track to meet our carbon budgets”.30 The Government stated that the Clean Growth Strategy set out a “possible pathway” for meeting the fifth carbon budget:  26 27 28  29 30  PQ 20813 [on carbon emissions] 7 January 2016 HM Government, The Clean Growth Strategy, October 2017 See, for example, HC Deb 27 June 2017, Col 455. Requirement set out in section 14(1) of the Climate Change Act 2008 Gov.uk, Clean Growth Strategy, 12 October 2017, p8 Gov.uk, Clean Growth Strategy, 12 October 2017, p9  Number CBP7555, 9 July 2019 12  Our Clean Growth Strategy sets out in detail a possible pathway for meeting the fifth carbon budget through domestic action, including many of the policies and proposals set out here. The route we ultimately take to meeting our targets will depend on a range of factors, in particular ensuring we are mindful of any impact on energy costs for households and businesses, and changes in costs as a result of innovation.31  However, the Government went onto state that its approach was “pragmatic”. The Strategy used the latest available projections at the time of publication which was the Government’s updated energy and emissions projections 2016 (March 2017) (see Box 1 on comparing data). Box 1: Comparing data The Clean Growth Strategy quoted data based on the latest available projections available at that time: the Updated Energy and Emissions Projections 2016. The emissions projections from the Clean Growth Strategy are therefore not directly comparable to the projections in the Updated energy and emissions projections 2017 or any subsequent projections. Much of the commentary and publications referenced in this Library Briefing Paper refer to the Clean Growth Strategy data. These remain relevant to the issue, debate and analysis, but more recent data is now available. The CCC comment on the new projections as follows: Emission projections are of course uncertain and subject to change (e.g. new projections are published annually). New government energy and emission projections were published in January 2018, and these imply a smaller policy gap than previously projected: • The new projections reduce 'business-as-usual' baseline emissions by around 3% in 2025 and 2030, compared to the previous projections used in the Clean Growth Strategy. This reflects a range of factors unrelated to Government policies. These include changes in projected fossil fuel prices, and inclusion of outturn data for the previous year on energy demand and temperatures. • The implication of this change is that future emissions are now projected to be lower than they were previously, and the gap to meeting the carbon budgets is smaller than previously projected. • The total change is a lowering of emissions by around 50 MtCO2e over both the fourth and fifth carbon budgets. This implies that the policy gaps may have reduced to around 10 MtCO2e, rather than 65 MtCO2e under the previous projections, although it may also be appropriate to revise down estimates of emissions savings. Policy and ambition should be consistent in the face of these changes, whilst evolving over time in response to sustained changes. In particular, we would not expect a reduction in policy ambition in response to a downward adjustment to the projections given the risk that this is reversed in later years and given the commitment in the Paris Agreement to increase effort and deliver beyond existing targets. Overall, these new projections do not change our key conclusion: there remains a gap to meeting the fourth and fifth carbon budgets, and new policies beyond those in the Clean Growth Strategy are required to close this gap.32  Using flexibilities to meet budgets? There are powers under section 17 of the Climate Change Act 2008 to "borrow" or "bank" amounts from one budgetary period to another. This allows the government to increase the budget by borrowing up to 1% from the succeeding period, which is consequently reduced by the amount 31 32  Gov.uk, Clean Growth Strategy, 12 October 2017, p54 Committee on Climate Change, An Independent assessment of the UK’s Clean Growth Strategy, January 2018, Box 1 [accessed 9 March 2018]  13 UK Carbon Budgets  borrowed. Conversely, if it has a surplus in a budgetary period, it can carry all or some of it forward to the next period. These powers are subject to consulting with the other national authorities and subject to obtaining and taking account of the advice of the CCC. The Clean Growth Strategy referenced these powers and stated that the Government was “prepared to use the flexibilities available to us to meet carbon budgets, subject to the requirements in the Climate Change Act, if this presents better value for UK taxpayers, businesses and domestic consumers”.33 It went onto say that it may not need to use this option and will make the decisions following consultation with the devolved Administrations and advice from the CCC: The Act allows Government some flexibility on when and how to reduce UK emissions on route to 2050 but before doing so the Government must obtain and take into account the advice of the Committee on Climate Change and consult the Devolved Administrations. There are three options: 1. Carry forward over-achievement from earlier budgets: The Act allows for Government to carry forward overachievement from one carbon budget to the next, so that early action to reduce emissions increases the following budget. 2. Carry back from later carbon budgets: The Act allows for the Government to increase the carbon budget in one period with a corresponding tightening of the next carbon budget. This ‘borrowing’ is limited to one per cent of the later carbon budget. 3. Use international carbon credits: The Act allows for the purchase of good quality international carbon credits to contribute to meeting carbon budgets but with a limit on the use of these credits set 18 months in advance of the relevant carbon budget.34  The Committee on Climate Change initially commented on the Strategy as follows: New policies included in the strategy will begin to close the significant gap between existing policies and what is required to meet the carbon budgets. We welcome the new thinking and ambition. We also recognise that the Government has identified areas where it will aim to do more and acknowledges there is work to be done to develop effective new policies.35  The press release went on to indicate that the CCC would not support the use of flexibilities to meet the fourth and fifth carbon budgets, emphasizing that the goal should be to deliver the budgets through domestic action alone: We note that the Clean Growth Strategy suggests that ‘flexibilities’ in the Climate Change Act could be used to meet the carbon budgets in place of domestic action. This should not be the plan. The clear intention of the UK’s fourth and fifth carbon budgets is that they are  33 34 35  HM Government, The Clean Growth Strategy, October 2017, p.40 Gov.uk, Clean Growth Strategy, 12 October 2017, p41 Committee on Climate Change, CCC Welcomes publication of the UK Government’s Clean Growth Strategy, 12 October 2017  Number CBP7555, 9 July 2019 14  delivered through domestic action to keep the UK on the lowest cost path to the 2050 target to reduce emissions by at least 80% compared to 1990 levels. That should be the goal, without the use of accounting flexibilities or reliance on international carbon credits.36  The CCC subsequently published its Independent Assessment of the Clean Growth Strategy (Jan 2018) which repeated its opposition to the use of flexibility mechanisms to help meet the fourth and fifth budgets, explaining (amongst other things) that the Committee’s recommendations for the levels of these budgets were based on an assumption that outperformance of earlier budgets would not be carried forward. 37 The CCC also pointed to the Paris Climate Change Agreement, stating that: The Paris Agreement is likely to require more ambitious long-term emissions targets than currently legislated. Should any carbon budget be outperformed, these lower emissions should provide the basis to prepare for tighter targets to be met in future; outperformance of carbon budgets should not be used to reduce ambition under existing targets.38  The Government’s approach was criticised by Opposition Members, including that the Strategy does not set out measures to fully meet the fourth or fifth carbon budgets. For example Dr Alan Whitehead (Labour) stated: Even with the additional measures set out in this plan, as the report states on page 41, it is estimated that the UK will over-emit at the conclusion of the fourth carbon budget by 6% above that budget and at the conclusion of the fifth carbon budget by 9.7%. What additional proposals does the Minister have in mind to rectify that deficit—or does she consider that somehow we will get there without anything other than what is in this plan?39  The Minister for Climate Change (Claire Perry) responded that her intention was that the Government would not have to use the flexibilities between budgets: […] we can use flexibilities. My intention is that we do not have to use them.40  The CCC wrote to the Minister for Energy and Clean Growth on 18 February 2019 about the carry-forward of surplus emissions from the UK’s second carbon budget. The letter stated that “carry forward of the surplus undermines the integrity of the framework for emissions reduction under the Climate Change Act”. It went onto state: Our conclusion is made stronger in the context of the UK’s commitment to the Paris Agreement and the possibility of a strengthened UK emissions target, on which you have asked my Committee for advice. Reducing ambition in Carbon Budgets 3-5 by carrying forward surplus emissions would not be consistent with the 36  37  38  39 40  Committee on Climate Change, CCC Welcomes publication of the UK Government’s Clean Growth Strategy, 12 October 2017 Committee on Climate Change, An Independent assessment of the UK’s Clean Growth Strategy, January 2018, Box 2 [accessed 9 March 2018] Committee on Climate Change, An Independent assessment of the UK’s Clean Growth Strategy, January 2018, Box 2 [accessed 9 March 2018] HC Deb 12 October 2017, Col 486 HC Deb 12 October 2017, Col 488  15 UK Carbon Budgets  Paris Agreement. It makes the existing 80% target for 2050, and any more ambitious target(s) that might be set, more difficult and expensive to meet. It would also make the Government’s commitment to clean growth harder to deliver at a time when even greater ambition is required. The aim should be to meet and outperform carbon budgets through actions to reduce emissions, rather than relying on statistical revisions which can go both up and down.41  More recently, a letter exchange between the interim Minister (Chris Skidmore) and the CCC Chairman (Lord Deben) discusses the carry-forward of surplus emissions from the second carbon budget (2013-2017). The Minister has restated that the Government has “no intention” of using surplus emissions from carbon budget 2 to meet carbon budget 3, but has confirmed that pending advice from the CCC on potential technical changes to the baseline, the Government will “carry over a small proportion of the surplus (88 megatonnes of CO2 – out of the surplus 384 megatonnes – which is around 3% of Carbon Budget 2) whilst this work is completed”.42 Lord Deben has replied reiterating that the position of the CCC remains that the surplus emissions in the second carbon budget were not due to policy (see section 3.2 of this paper below) and that the surplus should not be used to reduce the ambition of Carbon Budget 3.43 The CCC will follow up with further advice on technical changes to the baseline.  41  42 43  CCC, Letter from Lord Deben to Claire Perry on carry-forward of surplus emissions, 18 February 2019 [accessed 20 February 2019] CCC, Letter from Chris Skidmore to Lord Deben, 6 June 2019 [accessed 8 July 2019] CCC, Letter from Lord Deben to Chris Skidmore, 6 June 2019 [accessed 8 July 2019]  Number CBP7555, 9 July 2019 16  3. Performance against carbon budgets 3.1 The UK Net Carbon Account Under the 2008 Act, performance against carbon budgets is measured by the ‘net UK carbon account’. This measure is currently defined as the sum of three components: 1  Emissions allowances allocated to the UK under the EU ETS: the ‘traded’ sector refers to those sectors of the economy covered by the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), primarily electricity generation and energy-intensive industry. The emissions attributed to the traded sectors is the UK’s allocation of allowances under the EU ETS, rather than the actual UK territorial emissions in those sectors  2  UK emissions not covered by the EU ETS: the ‘non-traded’ sector covers all emissions outside the EU ETS, including transport, heating in buildings, agriculture, waste and some industry. The emissions attributed to the non-traded sectors reflects the actual emissions from the UK in those sectors.  3  Credits / debits from other international crediting systems.44  The measure therefore allows carbon credits bought from the EU ETS to improve budget performance, by decreasing the measurement of emissions. Conversely, carbon credits sold to the EU ETS can worsen performance, by increasing the overall total emissions attributed to the UK account. This has been the subject of Parliamentary debate, with some arguing that the UK’s performance should be measured using actual UK territorial emissions only (see Box 2). Box 2: amending the UK net carbon account? The Energy Bill 2016 was introduced in the Lords, and was amended there to include a clause that would have adjusted the performance measure used in the carbon budgets so that performance was measured using actual UK territorial emissions only. With this change, credits or debits from the EU ETS would no longer contribute towards the UK’s performance against its carbon budgets. The amendment was removed in the Commons. On returning to the Lords, opposition amendments were tabled to require the Secretary of the State to review whether the net carbon account for the Fifth Budget should include EU ETS credits, and requiring regulations to be introduced. None were successful. The Energy Act 2016 does not therefore adjust the performance measurement. The change would have meant that the CCC would need to produce a new Fifth Carbon Budget recommendation. Any new budget recommendation may well have been based on the cost effective path for territorial emissions that the CCC outlined (but did not recommend) in the 5th Carbon Budget Executive Summary.  Moreover, if the UK leaves the EU ETS following Brexit, there will be consequential impacts on the way that the UK measures its performance 44  Gov.uk, Updated energy and emissions projections 2017, 2 January 2018, Box 1 [accessed 15 March 2018]  17 UK Carbon Budgets  against domestic carbon budgets by the net UK carbon account. One clearcut change would be to measure the UK carbon budget by actual UK emissions, although previous attempts to make this change have been unsuccessful (see Box 2). The UK Government has not yet indicated what its approach might be. Any such change to measuring the net UK carbon account would likely require the UK’s future carbon budgets to be revisited. Detailed discussion of the potential impact of Brexit on climate change policies in the UK (including the EU ETS and carbon pricing) is set out in the Library Briefing Paper on Brexit: energy and climate change (section 6).  3.2 Performance to date The UK met the first and second carbon budgets. The first carbon budget (2008-2012) was outperformed by one per cent, and official statistics indicate that the second budget (2013-2017) was outperformed by around 14%.45 The CCC attributed the outperformance of the second budget “very largely due to accounting changes in the EU Emissions Trading System and the lasting effects of the recession” and stated it was “not due to policy”.46 The Government attributed the overachievement in the second budget largely to the technical impacts of the way the EU ETS allowances were accounted for but also, to a lesser extent, to actual emissions reductions: Overachievement in the second carbon budget is partly due to differences between actual UK EU ETS allowances and those assumed when the budget was set (296 MtCO2e). This is purely an accounting impact and not related to actual UK emissions. The remaining 88 MtCO2e is due to non-traded emissions being lower than the target level.47  Overall, UK emissions were 43% below 1990 levels in 2017.48 The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy attributed the reduction in emissions largely to a decrease in the use of coal for electricity generation and identified transport as the largest emitting sector of UK greenhouse gases in 2017.49 Government projections in April 2019 expected the UK to outperform against the third carbon budget (2018-2022) with headroom of 3.5% (88 MtCO2). However, based on existing policies and a subset of early stage policies and proposals from the Clean Growth Strategy, there was a predicted shortfall for the fourth and fifth carbon budgets (5.6% and 9.6% respectively).50  45  46  47  48  49  50  Gov.uk DBEIS national statistics, Final UK greenhouse gas emissions national statistics: 1990-2017, 5 February 2019 [accessed 8 February 2019].

This means that we have reduced emissions faster than any other G7 nation, while leading the G7 group of countries in growth in national income over this period. This progress has meant that we have outperformed the target emissions reductions of our first carbon budget (2008 to 2012) by one per cent and we project that we will outperform against our second and third budgets, covering the years 2013 to 2022, by almost five per cent and four per cent respectively. Our economy is expected to grow by 12 per cent over that time. This will be a significant achievement.52  The Committee on Climate Change published its independent assessment of the UK’s Clean Growth Strategy in January 2018. Its conclusions included that gaps remained of around 10-65 MtCO2e to meeting both the fourth and fifth carbon budgets on the basis of central projects and that these gaps must be closed (see Box 1 on comparing data): Gaps to meeting the fourth and fifth carbon budgets remain. These must be closed. Whilst the Strategy sets out a '2032 Pathway' for sectoral emissions that would just meet the fifth carbon budget, there is no clear link to the policies, proposals and intentions that the Strategy presents. Our assessment of the policies and proposals set out in the Strategy indicates that, even if these deliver in full, there remain gaps of around 10-65 MtCO2e to meeting both the fourth and fifth carbon budgets on the basis of central projections. ‒ Fourth carbon budget (2023 to 2027). There is a particular risk around meeting the fourth carbon budget, given that it begins in only five years’ time and that plans set out so far are insufficient. The Government should set out in 2018 the additional policies that will close the remaining gap to meeting the budget (e.g. on energy efficiency, low-carbon heating, afforestation, waste). By 2020 there should be a plan that provides confidence that the fourth carbon budget will be met through UK domestic action. ‒ Fifth carbon budget (2028 to 2032). There are only 10 years until the start of the fifth carbon budget. Lead-times, particularly for UK supply chains, mean that clarity is required soon in order to drive the necessary investments. It is urgent that the Government sets out how the Strategy's ambitions and intentions will be delivered in full, and develops new policies to close the remaining gap. 53  The CCC subsequently published its 2018 Progress Report to Parliament in June 2018.54 The Committee’s headline findings included: •  UK greenhouse gas emissions have reduced by 43% compared to 1990 levels, on the way to a target of at least an 80% reduction by 2050.  52  Gov.uk, Clean Growth Strategy, 12 October 2017, p5 Committee on Climate Change, An Independent assessment of the UK’s Clean Growth Strategy, January 2018, Executive Summary [accessed 9 March 2018] CCC, Reducing UK emissions: 2018 Progress Report to Parliament, 28 June 2018  53  54  Number CBP7555, 9 July 2019 20  •  75% of emission reductions since 2012 have come from the power sector, but all other sectors are flat (transport, industry, buildings, agriculture, waste and F-gases).  The CCC’s 2018 Report echoed its 2017 Progress Report to Parliament55 with a clear message to the Government that the UK is not on course to meet the legally binding fourth and fifth carbon budgets, calling on the Government to bring forward new fully funded policies to address this: The UK is not on course to meet the legally binding fourth and fifth carbon budgets. It will not be on course unless risks to the delivery of existing policies are reduced significantly and until Government brings forward new fully funded policies, beyond the achievements to date on electricity generation and waste.56  The Committee went on to lay out four key messages: •  Support the simple, low-cost options Low-cost, low-risk options to reduce emissions are not being supported by Government. This penalises the consumer. There is no route to market for cheap onshore wind; withdrawal of incentives has cut home insulation installations to 5% of their 2012 level; woodland creation falls short of stated Government ambition in every part of the UK. Worries over the short term cost of these options are misguided. The whole-economy cost of meeting the legally binding targets will be higher without cost-effective measures in every sector.  •  Commit to effective regulation and strict enforcement Tougher long-term standards, for construction and vehicle emissions for example, can cut emissions, while driving consumer demand, innovation, and cost reduction. Providing long line of sight to new regulation also reduces the overall economic costs of compliance. Regulations must also be enforced to be effective: the consumer is cheated when their car's fuel consumption and real emissions exceed the quoted test-cycle numbers; or when higher energy bills are locked-in for generations when stated building standards are not enforced.  •  End the chopping and changing of policy A number of important programmes have been cancelled in recent years at short notice, including Zero Carbon Homes and the CCS Commercialisation Programme. This has led to uncertainty, which carries a real cost. A consistent policy environment keeps investor risk low, reduces the cost of capital, provides clear signals to the consumer and gives businesses the confidence to build UK-based supply chains.  •  Act now to keep long-term options open An 80% reduction in emissions has always implied the need for new national infrastructure - to transport and store CO2 for example, or to provide decarbonised heat. The deeper emissions reductions implied by the Paris Agreement make these developments even more important. We cannot yet  55  56  CCC, Meeting the Carbon Budgets: closing the policy gap, 2017 Report to Parliament, June 2017 CCC, Reducing UK emissions: 2018 Progress Report to Parliament, 28 June 2018, p.12  21 UK Carbon Budgets  define the 2050 systems for carbon capture, zero-carbon transport, hydrogen or electrification of heat, but the Government must now demonstrate it is serious about their future deployment. Key technologies should be pulled through to bring down costs and support the growth of the low-carbon goods and services sector.  In response the Government recognised the CCC’s view that further action was needed to reduce the risks to delivery of future carbon budgets, and that “ambitious implementation of the policies and proposals set out in the Clean Growth Strategy” was its “priority”: […] Our approach has two guiding objectives – to meet our domestic commitments at the lowest possible net cost to UK taxpayers, consumers and businesses, and to maximise the social and economic benefits for the UK from this transition. To meet these objectives, we need to support innovation in both technologies and processes, to help drive down costs and secure the UK’s economic advantage. We also need to acknowledge that we cannot predict every technological breakthrough. Therefore we need to ensure that we are creating the best possible environment for the private sector to innovate and invest. We also acknowledge the areas where we face the greatest uncertainty and challenge. For these areas, we are laying the groundwork for the major decisions our analysis shows we need to make. To help demonstrate the steps needed to make these decisions, we have updated the milestones and actions table from the Clean Growth Strategy, with the actions we will be taking over the coming months. We agree with the CCC that ambitious implementation of the policies and proposals set out in the Clean Growth Strategy is vital to meet our carbon budgets, and that is our priority. Looking forward, we recognise the CCC’s view that further action and detailed policy measures are needed to reduce the risks to delivery of our future carbon budgets. Our key focus in the coming months and years will be to ensure we are addressing those risks. As part of this we have set up new processes to ensure that departments across the Government are delivering on the commitments made in the Clean Growth Strategy and looking for opportunities to go further, including through our Environment and Clean Growth InterMinisterial Group. […]57  In light of the net zero for 2050 target which was introduced in June 2019, the CCC has emphasised that the target is “just the first step” and needs to be reinforced by credible UK policies.58 BEIS Secretary of State acknowledged this in his statement to the House of Commons on 12 June, pointing to existing strategies in place (such as the Clean Growth Strategy) that form the foundations for the changes needed: In fulfilling the scale of the commitment we are making today, we will need technological and logistical changes in the way we use our land, with more emphasis, for example, on carbon sequestration. We will need to redouble our determination to seize the opportunity to 57  58  HM Government, Delivering Clean Growth, Progress against meeting our carbon budgets – the Government Response to the Committee on Climate Change, October 2018 Committee on Climate Change, Response to Government plan to legislate for net Zero UK emissions target, 11 June 2019  Number CBP7555, 9 July 2019 22  support investment in a range of new technologies, including in areas such as carbon capture, usage and storage, and in hydrogen and bioenergy. However, as the committee also found, the foundations for these step changes are already in place, including in the industrial strategy and the clean growth strategy. Indeed, there is no reason whatever to fear that fulfilling this commitment will do anything to limit our success in the years ahead—quite the reverse. In our industrial strategy, we have backed technology and innovation, including the UK’s biggest ever increase in public investment in research and development.59  This is further discussed in the Library Briefing Paper on Legislating for net zero (27 June 2019).  59  HC Deb 12 June 2019 Col 663  23 UK Carbon Budgets  4. International commitments and Brexit 4.1 Implications of the Paris Climate Change Agreement The Paris Agreement’s central aim is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. More detailed information on the Paris Agreement is available in the Library Briefing Paper on Climate Change Conference (COP24): Katowice, Poland. The CCC published advice in light of the Paris Agreement in October 2016 where it concluded that at that time the most important contribution the UK Government could make was publishing a robust plan to meet the UK carbon budgets and delivering policies in line with the plan.60 The CCC’s independent assessment of the UK’s Clean Growth Strategy reiterated its previous view and noted that proposals for meeting the carbon budgets should “also leave open the possibility of reducing emissions more quickly than required by the budgets, given that the Paris Agreement has more ambitious aims to limit global temperature increase than the aims on which the UK’s carbon budgets are based”.61 It also said that once the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published its Special Report on the implications of the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C ambition, the Government should request further advice from the CCC on the implications of the Paris Agreement for the UK’s long-term emissions targets.62 The IPCC Special Report was published in early October 2018.63 The IPCC press release noted that limiting warming to 1.5°C is possible but would require “rapid and far-reaching” transitions across multiple sectors: “The good news is that some of the kinds of actions that would be needed to limit global warming to 1.5ºC are already underway around the world, but they would need to accelerate,” said Valerie Masson-Delmotte, Co-Chair of Working Group I. The report finds that limiting global warming to 1.5°C would require “rapid and farreaching” transitions in land, energy, industry, buildings, transport, and cities. Global net human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) would need to fall by about 45 percent from 60 61  62  63  CCC, UK climate action following the Paris Agreement, 13 October 2016 Committee on Climate Change, An Independent assessment of the UK’s Clean Growth Strategy, January 2018, p32 [accessed 9 March 2018] Committee on Climate Change, An Independent assessment of the UK’s Clean Growth Strategy, January 2018, p31 [accessed 9 March 2018] IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C, October 2018 [accessed 20 February 2019] The IPCC is the leading international body for the assessment of climate change.

This means that any remaining emissions would need to be balanced by removing CO2 from the air. “Limiting warming to 1.5ºC is possible within the laws of chemistry and physics but doing so would require unprecedented changes,” said Jim Skea, Co-Chair of IPCC Working Group III.64  On 15 October 2018, the Minister for Climate Change (Claire Perry) wrote to the CCC asking them to update their advice from October 2016, in order to “inform consideration of the UK’s long term targets” including advice on a possible net zero greenhouse gas or carbon target.65 The letter explicitly excluded carbon budgets 3, 4 and 5 from the scope of the advice. On 2 May 2019, the CCC published its Report on Net Zero: the UK’s contribution to stopping global warming which recommended the Government legislate for a new emissions target for the UK of net-zero greenhouse gases by 2050. In June 2019, an amendment to the Climate Change Act 2008 was approved by both Houses to change the target for the net UK carbon account from at least 80% lower than the 1990 baseline to at least 100% lower (net zero). It came into force on 27 June 2019.66 In a House of Lords debate on 8 July 2019, the Parliamentary UnderSecretary of State, Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (Lord Henley) was asked what plans the Government had to adjust carbon budgets in light of the Paris Agreement. He responded: […] our existing carbon budgets are already among the most ambitious in the world. They continue to set the right level of challenge for the years ahead. Our priority is to deliver against these stretching targets through our clean growth strategy.67  4.2 Potential impact of Brexit The Clean Growth Strategy explained the Government’s view of the potential impact of Brexit on climate change policies, stating that domestic commitments would not be affected but the exact nature of the UK’s future relationship with the EU, including in areas such as the EU ETS were “still to be determined”: Leaving the EU will not affect our statutory commitments under our own domestic Climate Change Act and indeed our domestic binding emissions reduction targets are more ambitious than those set by EU legislation. The exact nature of the UK’s future relationship with the EU and the long-term shape of our involvement in areas like the EU Emissions Trading System are still to be determined. There are also emerging opportunities to drive more action – for example by putting emission reductions and land stewardship at the heart of a post EU agricultural support policy. We will therefore carefully examine each area of common interest with our EU partners and work to deliver  64  65  66 67  IPCC Press Release, Summary for Policymakers of IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C approved by government, 8 October 2018 [accessed 20 February 2019] Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Letter to CCC, 15 October 2018 [accessed 11 February 2019] The Climate Change Act 2008 (2050 Target Amendment) Order 2019 HL Deb 8 July 2019 Vol 798  25 UK Carbon Budgets  policies and programmes that are at least as beneficial as the current arrangements.68  The future of the UK’s participation in the EU ETS has an impact on UK carbon budgets insofar as the UK net carbon account is measured (see above).

The UK is currently in the transition period as set out in the Withdrawal Agreement, which entered into force with the UK’s departure. Until the transition period ends (expected to be at the end of 2020), the UK will continue to have the same relationship with regards to rules, including on energy and climate change, as when the UK was a Member State of the EU. This paper sets out the existing relationship between the UK and EU in relation to energy and climate change and the position of both parties regarding these areas in the negotiations for the future relationship. Energy Member States of the EU are ultimately responsible for the energy supply to their citizens, and for deciding on the most appropriate energy mix. However, the UK and EU energy sectors remain integrated through trade, legislation, and interconnection of energy supply, as well as sharing joint research and development aims. Civil nuclear - Euratom The European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) provides the basis for the regulation of civilian nuclear activity in its members. Euratom’s roles include implementing a system of safeguards to monitor the use of civil nuclear materials, controlling the supply of nuclear materials, and funding research. The UK left Euratom as part of its departure from the EU, though the arrangements between Euratom and the UK will continue through the transition period. Both the UK Government and EU negotiating directives for the future relationship refer to an intention for “cooperation” on civil nuclear. The UK Government has already legislated to replicate Euratom’s nuclear safeguards regime and negotiated agreements for nuclear trade with certain countries. More information is available in the Library paper on Euratom. Energy trading The UK has five electricity interconnectors with continental Europe and the island of Ireland and more are either under construction or planned. As part of the transition period, the UK remains a member of the EU internal energy market (IEM) which allows harmonised, tariff-free trading of gas and electricity across Europe through interconnectors. This harmonised market makes trading more efficient and can reduce costs to consumers. The future of the UK relationship with the IEM is subject to the negotiations. Both parties have published draft texts detailing provisions on cooperation on trade in electricity and gas. While there are areas of overlap, there are also differences between the positions including on the details of energy trading, membership of bodies, and governance. Implications for the island of Ireland The island of Ireland operates a Single Electricity Market (SEM) which allows free trade of power across the island. A new Integrated Single Electricity Market designed closely around the rules of the IEM, launched in 2018. Provisions to allow the continued functioning of the SEM were set out in the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland in the Withdrawal Agreement. The UK’s future relationship with  4  Brexit: Energy and Climate Change  the IEM may have an impact on the operation of the SEM as currently the only connections between the island of Ireland and mainland Europe are through interconnectors via Great Britain. The Withdrawal Agreement did not cover trading between the island of Ireland and GB; stakeholders have called for the future relationship negotiations to consider arrangements to facilitate this trading. Climate change The UK Government is committed to domestic and international efforts to tackle climate change, neither of which have been impacted by leaving the EU. However, the level of the UK’s involvement, future cooperation and alignment with EU climate change efforts remains subject to ongoing negotiation. As an example, on carbon pricing, the UK Government and devolved Administrations have designed a new UK emissions trading scheme for 2021 onwards, which may or may not be linked to the EU emissions trading scheme. The inclusion of enforceable climate change obligations, including those at an international level such as the Paris Agreement, within the UK-EU trade agreement also remains subject to ongoing negotiations.  5  Commons Library Briefing, 19 June 2020  1. Introduction The UK left the European Union (EU) on 31 January 2020. The UK is currently in the transition period as set out in the Withdrawal Agreement which entered into force with the UK’s departure. Until the transition period ends (currently expected to be at the end of 2020) the UK will continue to have the same relationship with regards to rules, including on energy and climate change, as when the UK was a Member State of the EU. The UK’s energy and climate change sectors are largely governed by domestic policy, but aspects are also integrated with the EU, meaning the future relationship could affect several energy and climate change policies. This remains subject to the outcome of the ongoing negotiations. On energy, although Member States remain ultimately responsible for security of energy supply to citizens, and for deciding their energy mix, the UK and EU energy sectors remain integrated through trade, legislation and interconnection of energy supply. Consequently, the future relationship between the UK and EU has the potential to affect the UK’s civil nuclear industry, including nuclear power and research, and the trade of electricity and gas through interconnectors. Additional areas that may be affected include the island of Ireland’s energy market, energy efficiency regulations, and general energy infrastructure through wider changes to trade and the movement of people. On climate change, the UK has standalone domestic legislation in the form of the Climate Change Act 2008 including a net zero by 2050 target. The UK is also part of an international effort to combat climate change, which, until the end of the transition period, is intertwined to some extent with the EU, including contributing to the EU’s international commitments and direct participation in the EU emissions trading scheme. The UK’s future alignment with EU climate change mechanisms is subject to negotiations, but there will be some domestic changes including a new UK emissions trading scheme which is due to be put in place by 2021. The Withdrawal Agreement contains technical information relating to the civil nuclear industry. The Ireland/Northern Ireland protocol within the Withdrawal Agreement will come into force at the end of the transition period and provide for the continued operation of the Irish Single Electricity Market including Northern Ireland’s continued participation in the EU ETS. The Political Declaration includes references to future cooperation on a number of areas, including energy trading, nuclear cooperation, and tackling climate change in international fora and under international agreements. In relation to the future relationship negotiations, the UK Government has not included energy or climate change in its proposed comprehensive free trade agreement. Instead it has proposed a separate  6  Brexit: Energy and Climate Change  draft energy agreement 1 which includes provisions on trading in gas and electricity, as well as proposals on climate change co-operation, climate change laws and policies and carbon pricing. The UK has also published a separate draft civil nuclear agreement. 2 In contrast, the EU has included energy, climate change, and civil nuclear within its draft treaty. 3 The draft treaty includes measures to facilitate nuclear cooperation, promote energy efficiency and renewable energy, maintain competitive markets and use gas and electricity interconnectors “efficiently”. The EU includes the fight against climate change as an “essential element” of the partnership as well as within its proposed level playing field provisions. This paper focuses on the EU and UK Government positions. The Northern Ireland Executive, 4 Scottish Government 5 and Welsh Government 6 have all made statements setting out their position on the future relationship negotiations. The research services in Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, have also published briefings on the negotiations and the specific implications for each of the devolved nations.  1 2  3  4  5  6  UK Negotiating Team, Draft working text for an agreement on energy, 19 May 2020 UK negotiating team, Draft working text for an agreement […] on Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy, 19 May 2020 European Commission, Draft text of the Agreement on the New Partnership with the United Kingdom, 18 March 2020 The Executive Office, Statement from the First Minister and deputy First Minister on the publication of the UK negotiating mandate, 27 February 2020 Scottish Government, EU-UK future relationship negotiations: statement by the Cabinet Secretary for Constitution, Europe and External Affairs, 3 June 2020 Welsh Government, Written Statement: Welsh Government’s analysis of the UK Government’s negotiating mandate for the Future Relationship with the EU, 28 February 2020  7  Commons Library Briefing, 19 June 2020  2. Civil Nuclear - Euratom The European Atomic Energy Community, better known as Euratom, was established in the 1950s as part of the creation of the European Community. The UK became a member of Euratom on 1 January 1973 7 and left on 31 January 2020 as it entered the transition period in line with the Withdrawal Agreement. Euratom provides the basis for the regulation of civil nuclear activity (meaning non-military uses of nuclear such as power production and medicine). Euratom’s role includes implementing a system of safeguards to monitor the use of civil nuclear materials, controlling the supply of fissile materials within EU member states, and funding leading international research such as the Culham Centre of Fusion Energy in Oxfordshire. For more information, see the Library’s briefing paper on Euratom.  2.1 Background on Civil Nuclear The UK’s future relationship with Euratom could have implications for the UK’s current nuclear operations, including fuel supply, waste management, cooperation with other nuclear states, and research. The UK Government has said it wants a “close” and “effective” future relationship with Euratom. 8  Nuclear Safeguards Nuclear Safeguards are measures to verify that countries comply with their international obligations not to use civil nuclear materials for nuclear weapons. 9 The Nuclear Safeguards Act 2018 provided for a new domestic safeguard regime to replace the Euratom regime. Before the UK left Euratom, funding was allocated to the UK’s existing body, the Office of Nuclear Regulation, to implement the new regime. 10 As such, there was not a disruptive impact on nuclear safeguards as part of the UK’s exit from Euratom. The Library Briefing on the Nuclear Safeguards Act 2018 provides further detail.  Nuclear Cooperation Agreements for trade Nuclear Cooperation Agreements (NCAs) facilitate trade, for example, in nuclear materials including fuel. An NCA is not a legal requirement for trade in many countries (where export licences can be used) but is a requirement in Australia, Canada, Japan and the US. The UK already had an agreement with Japan, and agreed new NCAs with the US in 7 8  9  10  Treaty of Accession of Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom, 1972  HM Government, The Future Relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, 12 July 2018, Cm 9593, para 144 Office for Nuclear Regulation, What are nuclear safeguards?

Radioactive isotopes 13 are used in medicine for the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases, including cancers, cardiovascular and brain disorders. 14 In the UK, around 700,000 nuclear medicine procedures using radioisotopes are carried out each year. 15 Medical isotopes are imported into the UK; mainly sourced from a few research reactors. 16 Many of these reactors are in EU countries such as the Netherlands, Poland, Belgium, France, Germany and the Czechia. 17 Although radioisotopes can be sourced from beyond the EU, the materials often have short half-lives meaning they can decay rapidly and cannot be stored. This creates the need for constant supply which has failed in the past, creating global shortages. 18 Prior to the UK’s departure from Euratom, some health specialists 19 and MPs 20 expressed concern that any changes to import arrangements as a result of leaving Euratom could impact on the delivery of health treatments. In a letter to Prime Minister Johnson on 1 August 2019, three groups who procure and use radioisotopes (the Royal College of Radiologists, the British Nuclear Medicine Society, and the UK Radiopharmacy Group) said they were “encouraged” by the work being undertaken by the Government to secure supplies of radioisotopes after Brexit (at the time various Brexit scenarios were possible). However, they continued that they “remain[ed] apprehensive” about supplier readiness and the impact of supply changes on patients. They asked the Prime Minister for clarity on issues including supplies in relation to a no deal Brexit which was a possibility at the time (see Section 6) but also on what action would be taken to address the “increased costs caused by Brexit”. 21 In response to a parliamentary question concerned with the supply of radioisotopes if the UK ends the transition period on 31 December  11 12  13 14 15 16 17 18  19  20  21  HCWS983, Energy Policy, 10 October 2018 Gov.uk, [CS Canada No.1/2018] UK/Canada: Agreement for Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy, 12 November 2018 POSTnote 558, Supply of medical Radioisotopes, July 2017 European Commission, Supply of medical radioisotopes, [accessed 16 June 2020] Supply of Medical Radioisotopes, POSTnote 558, July 2017 Some radioisotopes can also be produced in particle accelerators.

Research The UK collaborates with the EU on a number of nuclear research projects. Horizon 2020 Euratom’s research and training (R&T) programme is aligned with Horizon 2020. Horizon 2020 is the biggest EU Research and Innovation programme to date with nearly €80 billion of funding available over 7 years (2014 to 2020) in addition to private investment – this is for many sectors, not just nuclear. 23 Before Brexit, in August 2016 the Government announced it would underwrite funding for approved Horizon 2020 projects applied for before the UK left the EU, this included Euratom R&T funds. 24 In July 2018, the Treasury extended the Government’s guarantee to underwrite the UK’s allocation for funding until the end of 2020. 25 Fusion: JET and ITER The UK is also involved in EU nuclear fusion research as part of the JET (Joint European Torus) and ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) projects. JET is a magnetic fusion device, designed to prove the feasibility of fusion as an energy source. The project is based at Culham in Oxfordshire. Euratom provides 87.5% of the funding for the project and the UK Government provides the rest. 26 JET is helping to inform a larger fusion reactor – ITER - which is being built in France. The UK’s future involvement in JET and ITER remain subject to the negotiation. Government guidance states that from the end of the transition period in January 2021, JET operations will continue, but the UK will not be a member of the European contribution to ITER. 27 A contract extension announced in March 2019 means the EU and UK funding for JET will continue until the end of 2020. The UK Government press release also stated that the contract “leaves open the option of a 22 23 24  25 26  27  PQ HL4534, 20 May 2020 European Commission, What is Horizon 2020?

The ITER council has acknowledged “for decades, the UK has been a leader in the global fusion research community” in a statement on the possibility of future UK involvement in ITER. 29 UK Government guidance states the UK will leave the European contribution to ITER at the end of the transition period, but the guidance doesn’t mention whether the UK will seek to rejoin as a nonEuropean member. In the short term, the ITER council and UK Government have confirmed that current contracts with UK nationals and operators will be considered valid until their contractually agreed end date. 30  2.2 Negotiating positions for the Future Relationship Withdrawal agreement and Political declaration The Withdrawal Agreement includes civil nuclear provisions relating to nuclear safeguards, the ownership of materials and equipment, and nuclear waste. 31 Detail on these provisions is set out in Section 4.12 in the Library briefing paper on The UK’s EU Withdrawal Agreement (April 2019). The Political Declaration on the Framework for Future EU-UK relations includes references to nuclear safety, trade, research, and the supply of radioisotopes. Detail on these provisions is set out in Section 4.13 in the Library briefing paper on The Political Declaration on the Framework for Future EU-UK Relations (December 2018).  EU and UK Future Relationship Negotiating Positions On 18 March 2020, the EU published a draft treaty 32 which included provisions on civil nuclear. On 19 May 2020, the UK Government published a series of documents setting out its approach to the negotiations on the future relationship with the EU, including a draft civil nuclear agreement. 33 There are broad areas of overlap between the two draft documents: •  28 29 30 31  32  33  Safeguards: Within the current published draft texts, there is no substantial difference between the positions on the safeguards that will apply to the UK and EU as part of the future relationship.

The EU draft treaty states that the UK may participate in Euratom programmes such as ITER, with specific terms and conditions (such as financial contributions) to be determined in accordance with the Treaty’s provisions for Union programmes.  •  Other provisions: There is also overlap on technical provisions such as enrichment and intellectual property.  The fourth round of negotiations were completed in June 2020. Both Michel Barnier (representing the EU) 34 and David Frost (representing the UK) 35 said overall progress had been limited. Michel Barnier referred to civil nuclear cooperation as an area where he considered the UK was seeking to “distance themselves” from the “common basis” of the Political Declaration. Specifically, Barnier referred to distance from the objective of “maintain[ing] existing high standards of nuclear safety” (paragraph 66 of the Political Declaration). 36 David Frost did not mention nuclear or energy in his statement after the fourth round of negotiations. 37 However in a letter to Barnier in May 2020, Frost said that the UK’s legal texts “draw on precedent where relevant precedents exist” and included the example of nuclear, “ our draft civil nuclear agreement is very close to similar cooperation agreements that Euratom (and indeed the UK) has concluded with other third countries”. 38  Commentary Most commentary on the UK’s relationship with Euratom was published before the UK’s departure from Euratom. In December 2017, the House of Commons Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Committee published its report on ‘Leaving the EU: implications for the civil nuclear sector’. The report concluded: The UK’s departure from Euratom is an apparently necessary but unwanted consequence of exiting the European Union. The Government’s task is to minimise the potential adverse impacts of this departure. 39  34  35  36  37  38  39  European Commission, Statement by Michel Barnier following Round 4 of negotiations for a new partnership between the European Union and the United Kingdom, 5 June 2020 Gov.uk, No 10 media blog, David Frost’s statement following the conclusion of round 4 of negotiations with the EU, 5 June 2020 European Commission, Statement by Michel Barnier following Round 4 of negotiations for a new partnership between the European Union and the United Kingdom, 5 June 2020 Gov.uk, No 10 media blog, David Frost’s statement following the conclusion of round 4 of negotiations with the EU, 5 June 2020 Letter from David Frost to Michel Barnier regarding UK draft legal texts, 19 May 2020 House of Commons BEIS Committee, Leaving the EU: Implications for the civil nuclear sector, Second Report of Session 2017-19, 12 December 2017, para. 4  12 Brexit: Energy and Climate Change  Overall the Committee recommended an association with Euratom that replicates the existing functions. 40 The Government responded that it wanted a “close and effective association with Euratom” but that the nature of the relationship would be different, and subject to the negotiations on the future relationship. 41 The Library briefing paper on Euratom includes more information on the preparations the UK made for its departure from Euratom (in January 2020) along with details and commentary on the Government’s position on the future relationship with Euratom.  40  41  House of Commons BEIS Committee, Leaving the EU: Implications for the civil nuclear sector, Second Report of Session 2017-19, 12 December 2017, para. 43 House of Commons BEIS Committee, Leaving the EU: Implications for the civil nuclear sector: Government response to the Committee’s Second Report, Sixth Special Report of Session 2017-19, 6 March 2018, para 30  13 Commons Library Briefing, 19 June 2020  3. Energy Numerous aspects of the UK energy sector could be affected by the future relationship between the UK and EU. One of the key aspects, is the trading of energy across interconnectors operating in the EU’s internal energy market (IEM). Other aspects include energy efficiency, and cooperation on renewable development. This section sets out background on energy issues and provides the positions of each party to these areas in the future relationship negotiations. Some of these areas, specifically the UK’s relationship with the IEM, have implications for energy trading on the island of Ireland. This is considered in Section 4.  3.1 The Internal Energy Market (IEM) As part of the transition period, the UK remains part of the EU’s internal energy market (IEM). The IEM allows harmonised, tariff-free trading of gas and electricity across Europe (through interconnectors), leading to lower prices and greater security of supply. 42 The UK Government has been “a leading advocate for the development of the IEM and has heavily influenced the EU-wide rules, which draw on UK practice.” 43 Energy trading, and the degree of UK participation in the IEM, is being considered as part of the negotiations on the future relationship.  Development of the IEM During the 1990s, the EU and its Member States decided to liberalise energy markets, opening them to competition gradually. The EU-led changes, which have been developed through a series of legislative packages affecting the gas and electricity sectors, initially followed the more advanced liberalised status of the UK market: •  The first liberalisation Directives were adopted in 1996 (electricity) and 1998 (gas) and transposed into Member States' legal systems by 1998 (electricity) and 2000 (gas).  •  The second liberalisation Directives were adopted in 2003 with transposition of the Directives into national law by Member States in 2004. In the UK, these Directives were transposed into law largely by the Energy Act 2004.  •  Further measures have been introduced since to improve the functioning of the market. This includes the what was known as the third energy package, 44 transposed into UK law through the Electricity and Gas (Internal Markets) Regulations 2011 for Great Britain and separate regulations for Northern Ireland.  42  43  44  DexEU The United Kingdom’s exit from and new partnership with the European Union White Paper, C9417, 2 February 2017, p. 43 House of Commons Exiting the EU Committee, Electricity and Renewables Sector Report, 21 December 2017 European Commission, Third energy package, updated 16 March 2020  14 Brexit: Energy and Climate Change  •  A further update to EU energy policy was completed in 2019 with the ‘Clean energy for all Europeans’ package. In addition to provisions on energy performance in buildings, renewable energy, and energy efficiency, the package also contained elements relating to electricity market design with the aim of making the market “more flexible, more market-orientated, and better placed to integrate a greater share of renewables”. 45  Whether and to what extent these and future EU regulations will apply to the UK as part of the future relationship are subject to the outcome of the negotiations.  UK energy trading Interconnectors can operate in both directions, meaning they can import and export electricity and gas. The UK exports some gas and electricity through interconnectors at various points during the year, but overall the UK is a net importer of both gas and electricity. The extent of these imports has varied over time as the UK used to be a net exporter of gas, but has been a net importer for more than a decade. Trends over the last two decades are shown in the graph below. In 2018, the UK imported 5.4% of its electricity through interconnectors with EU or EEA countries (Norway, which is part of the IEM as an EEA member), and 40.7% of its gas. The gas comes from both EU or EEA interconnectors (85% of total gas imports) and LNG imports (4% of LNG imports from Norway and the rest from non-EU/EEA countries). 46,47  Source: DBEIS, Digest of UK Energy Statistics 2019.

Tables 5.5 and G.5  15 Commons Library Briefing, 19 June 2020  Electricity interconnectors and the IEM Great Britain has five completed electricity interconnectors with mainland Europe and the island of Ireland providing around 5GW of electricity interconnector capacity: •  2GW to France (IFA);  •  1GW to the Netherlands (BritNed);  •  500MW to Northern Ireland (Moyle);  •  500MW to the Republic of Ireland (East West) and  •  1GW to Belgium (NEMO).  These are shown in the Figure below (reproduced with permission from National Grid - the 1GW link to Belgium is now completed).  Source: Provided to the Library by National Grid, reproduced with permission.  In 2018, 67% of net electricity imports came from France, 32% from the Netherlands and 1% from the interconnectors with Ireland. The UK’s trading with the island of Ireland has fluctuated over time; in 2018 the island was a net importer of electricity from the UK. 48 Electricity interconnection capacity is due to nearly double by 2022 with numerous projects under construction, and further projects have sought regulatory approval. 49 The May Government’s 2017 Clean Growth Strategy set out the Government’s support for 9GW more capacity than was currently operational or under construction at the time. 50 The IEM facilitates harmonised tariff-free trade across these electricity interconnectors (see Box 1).

When the price of electricity is lower in one market, energy will flow from that market to the higher priced market. The effect of this is to make the prices in each converge – i.e. they increase in the exporting market and decrease in the importing market. As wholesale gas and electricity prices in the UK are generally higher than elsewhere in Europe, interconnection has caused a reduction in wholesale prices, and hence consumer prices, in the UK. 51 Interconnector cables also provide flexibility that can help to integrate intermittent renewable sources of electricity into power systems. This is because they prevent the need to curtail (i.e. disconnect from the grid) this power when supply is greater than demand by exporting any excess power. 52 Box 1: The IEM and Market Coupling As part of the development of the IEM, trade across electricity interconnectors is increasingly integrated via ‘market coupling’. Market coupling uses an algorithm to set prices and trading volumes across interconnected markets. Markets are said to be coupled when interconnector capacity and electricity are sold in a single market transaction, whereas in uncoupled markets these are sold separately. 53 Market coupling is a more efficient means of trading, which reduces system costs. Decoupling markets can therefore increase the costs of imports. Great Britain is currently coupled to north-west Europe and the island of Ireland in the ‘dayahead market’ (referring to electricity that is bought and sold a day ahead of delivery). Several EU countries are also coupled on the ‘intraday’ markets (for electricity that is sold between an hour and 24 hours ahead of delivery) 54 and work is underway for further countries to couple with the EU intraday market. The UK has set out its position on maintaining and extending its market coupling in its draft energy agreement (see section 3.4).  More information on electricity interconnectors is available from the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology’s note on Overseas Electricity Interconnection (February 2018).  Gas interconnectors The UK imports natural gas via pipelines from Norway, the Netherlands and Belgium (all IEM members) and by ship in the form of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). As most LNG comes from outside the EU (from countries such as Qatar), this section discusses interconnectors (with EU and EEA countries) only. As domestic gas production from the North Sea has declined, imports have risen. In the years from 2012 the UK has imported 25-40% of its 51  52 53  54  Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, Overseas Electricity Interconnection, February 2018.

Table G.5  18 Brexit: Energy and Climate Change  The rules of the IEM (known as European Network Codes - ENCs) are determined by European Network Transmission Systems Operators (ENTSOs), European Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and the European Commission (see Box 2). ENCs are ultimately upheld by the Court of the European Union (ECJ). Ending the jurisdiction of the ECJ in the UK has been a key part of the UK Government’s approach to Brexit. 56 The UK Government has proposed alternative governance and dispute arbitration mechanisms for the future relationship (see section 3.4). Integration with the IEM could require the UK’s compliance with current and future EU energy market rules, as well as some EU environmental legislation. 57 Box 2: IEM governing bodies A number of European bodies coordinate national energy institutions at the European level to help the IEM function. ACER Regulation (EC) No 713/2009 established the Agency for Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER), which has been fully operational since March 2011. ACER is largely responsible for promoting cooperation between national regulatory authorities at regional and European level and for monitoring development of the network and the internal electricity and gas markets. Ofgem (the GB energy regulator) 58 and the Utility Regulator (the Northern Ireland energy regulator) are currently members of ACER. ENTSO Two EU Regulations created structures of cooperation for European Network Transmission Systems Operators (ENTSOs): Regulation EC/714/2009 for electricity; and Regulation EC/715/2009 for gas. The ENTSOs, together with ACER, form detailed network access rules and technical codes, and ensure coordination of grid operation through the exchange of operational information and the development of common safety and emergency standards and procedures. UK Transmission System Operators, such as National Grid, are currently members of ENTSO-E and ENTSO-G. 59  3.2 Considerations for the Future Relationship The UK’s future participation in the IEM remains subject to the outcome of the future relationship negotiations (see section 3.4). It is important to note that whatever the outcome, interconnector trading is expected to continue: a number of countries outside of the EU currently trade energy through interconnectors with the EU. The EU does not currently apply tariffs to these imports. 60 56  57  58 59  60  Gov.uk, The government’s negotiating objectives for exiting the EU: PM speech, 17 January 2017 Lords EU Committee, Brexit: energy security, 10th Report of Session 2017-19, HL Paper 63, 29 January 2018, para. 70 Ofgem, Ofgem and Europe, [accessed: 16 June 2020] A full listing of Member Transmission System Operators is available on the ENTSO- E website and the ENTSO-G website. Gustav Frederiksson, Alexander Roth, Simone Tagliapietra, Georg Zachmann, The Impact of Brexit on the EU Energy System, 23 November 2017, p. 25  19 Commons Library Briefing, 19 June 2020  However there may be other costs to a different relationship with the IEM. These costs have the potential to impact EU countries, who either export or import energy from the UK, as well as the UK itself. Cost of Energy Leaving the IEM may cause an increase in the cost of energy imports. One estimate given by National Grid to the House of Commons Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Committee, in 2017, was that “UK consumers could face £500 million a year of costs by the early 2020s as a result of being outside the IEM”. This estimate was described by Paul Hallas, Director of Regulation and Strategy at Centrica, as “at the bleak end of the plausible envelope of possible outcomes. 61 Any extra cost is largely due to the likelihood the UK would need to be de-coupled from the EU market, making trading less efficient and more expensive (see Box 1). Energy security The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and the energy regulator Ofgem produce an annual Statutory Security of Supply report. The 2019 report said leaving the EU did not pose an energy security threat: The UK’s exit from the EU will not alter the fact that our energy system is resilient and secure and drawn from a number of sources. GB has one of the most reliable energy systems in the world and we remain confident in maintaining our secure energy supply. 62  However, it is possible that in future, in the event of leaving the IEM, the UK’s plans for further interconnectors could be more difficult. 63 More interconnectors are of benefit to the UK to increase the flexibility and resilience of grids, especially with increasing supply from intermittent renewable energy sources. For more information, see the Library briefing paper on Electricity grids. Influence on rules Depending on the relationship the UK negotiates with the EU in relation to the IEM, the UK’s influence on future rules may change (see Box 2). In May 2017, the BEIS Committee recommended that the Government “seek continued UK influence over the rules of the IEM [and] explore continued full membership of the technical institutions for developing the detailed rules of the Internal Energy Market.” 64 In January 2018, the Lords EU environment and energy sub-committee’s report on Energy Security said, “there is strong support across the energy industry for the UK to continue to participate in the Internal Energy Market (IEM) post-Brexit.” However, witnesses stated that if 61  62 63  64  BEIS Committee, Leaving the EU: negotiation priorities for energy and climate change policy, Fourth Report of Session 2016–17, HC 909, 2 May 2017, p. 12 BEIS and Ofgem, Statutory Security of Supply Report 2019, 2019 Andrew Ward, Our friends electric: interconnection and Brexit, Financial Times, 15 January 2018 BEIS Committee, Leaving the EU: negotiation priorities for energy and climate change policy, Fourth Report of Session 2016–17, HC 909, 2 May 2017, para. 39  20 Brexit: Energy and Climate Change  remaining in the IEM required the UK to comply with all EU standards, and potentially losing their representation ability to influence the IEM, then the UK would need to review the pros and cons of remaining in the IEM in that situation. 65  3.3 Other energy impacts While trade over interconnectors is a key part of the energy aspects under consideration in the future relationship negotiations, there may also be implications for some other areas of energy policy.  Energy efficiency Energy efficiency regulations limit the amount of energy that products consume which can reduce costs for consumers and reduce energyrelated emissions. Before the Brexit referendum, there were press reports that supported the case to leave the EU, as it would allow the UK to remove EU energy efficiency laws on household items such as vacuum cleaners and lightbulbs. 66 Existing EU energy efficiency directives have been implemented into UK law and so continue to apply now the UK has left the EU. The UK Government’s domestic policy, before Brexit and at present, is to keep costs down for consumers, and also to meet emissions targets (see section 5 below). The Government has said that after the transition period ends, the UK will meet or exceed existing product standards: From 1 January 2021, the UK will uphold common high product standards wherever possible and appropriate, or even exceed them where it is in the UK’s interest to do so. All EU ecodesign and energy labelling requirements which enter into force and apply before 31 December 2020 will have effect in the UK. Further legislation is being prepared to ensure that all of these requirements continue to function in the UK from 1 January 2021. 67  Trade There has been some concern that Brexit could affect investor confidence, the movement of industry specialists, or the import/export of materials linked to renewable energy technologies. 68 The House of Lords EU Energy and Environment sub-Committee has cautioned that any possible tariffs on products used in the construction and maintenance of the energy system could affect the energy industry. 69 This possible impact on new energy infrastructure has also  65  66  67 68  69  Lords EU Committee, Brexit: energy security, 10th Report of Session 2017-19, HL Paper 63, 29 January 2018 20 reasons you should vote to leave the European Union, The Telegraph, 22 June 2016 BEIS, Meeting climate change requirements from 1 January 2021, 28 April 2020 Jonathan Gaventa, The impact of Brexit on Europe’s energy and climate transition, E3G, 30 June 2017 Lords EU Committee, Brexit: energy security, 10th Report of Session 2017-19, HL Paper 63, 29 January 2018, para. 85  21 Commons Library Briefing, 19 June 2020  been reported in the media, with concerns raised about projects such as Hinkley Point in relation to general trade and movement of labour. 70 The impact of these potential issues will depend on any trade arrangements agreed as part of the future relationship negotiations. The professional services firm EY’s 2018 Renewable Energy Country Attractiveness Index, which ranks 40 countries based on the attractiveness of their clean energy markets to investors, saw the UK slip one place from 7th to 8th, with Brexit referred to as being one of the possible causes. 71 However in the most recent Index (May 2020), the UK rose to 6th place with new policies on renewable energy credited for the rise. 72  3.4 Negotiating positions for the Future Relationship 2018 White Paper and previous Withdrawal Agreement The May Government’s July 2018 White Paper on the Future Relationship between the UK and the EU made no commitment on the IEM and contained options to either leave or remain in the market. The paper said the UK was seeking “broad energy cooperation with the EU” and wanted to “explore the options” on the IEM. This included options of leaving and maintaining trading or retaining access and using a common rulebook for certain technical rules, though not, in the UK’s view, for wider environmental and climate change rules. 73 The Withdrawal Agreement negotiated by the May Government was not ratified and was superseded by the 2019 Withdrawal Agreement (below). The provisions on energy trading were the same in both texts.  Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration While the Withdrawal Agreement did not mention the IEM (other than in the Northern Ireland Protocol – see section 4 below) the Political Declaration setting out the framework for the future relationship between the EU and the UK stated there should be mechanisms to ensure “security of supply” and “efficient trade over interconnectors over different timeframes”. 74 More information on the provisions relating to energy in these documents are available in Section 8.6 of the Library briefing paper on The UK’s EU Withdrawal Agreement (April 2019) and 4.13 of the paper 70  71  72  73  74  Rob Davies, Energy projects including Hinkley Point threatened by Brexit, experts warn, The Guardian, 5 April 2017 EY, Renewable Energy Country Attractiveness Index, Issue 52.

EU and UK Future Relationship Negotiating Positions On 25 February 2020, the EU published negotiating directives for the future relationship, 75 including on electricity and gas. Detailed provisions building on these principles were included in the EU draft treaty published on 18 March 2020 76 (these texts refer to energy with raw materials, this paper focuses on energy). While the EU negotiating directives state clearly that “the UK will leave the internal market in energy”, the EU documents suggest a future partnership covering areas such as investment in renewable and energy efficiency technologies, measures to maintain competitive markets, and the efficient use of interconnectors. The UK Government published its approach to the negotiations in February 2020. 77 On 19 May 2020, the UK Government published a series of documents setting out its approach to the negotiations on the future relationship with the EU, including a draft energy agreement. 78 The UK position has some areas of broad overlap with the EU position, such as promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency, maintaining market-based prices, and some provisions relating to the efficient trading on interconnectors. However there are some areas of difference, including on the detail of IEM integration, cooperation and membership of relevant bodies (ENTSO and ACER), and governance. 79 Some of the key areas in the texts are: •  Renewable energy and energy efficiency: Both texts refer to support for renewable and energy efficiency technologies. The UK text has provisions on climate change (see section 5 below) which includes cooperation on trade and investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency goods. The EU text is more detailed, including a requirement to establish targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency in line with those that the UK already has as an EU member, promote, and cooperate on regulation and research on energy efficiency and renewable energy.  •  Efficient use of interconnectors: While both texts include provisions for gas and electricity balancing and trading, including avoiding barriers to cross-border trading, they differ on detail. Both include provisions on interconnector capacity allocation,  75  Council of the European Union, Directives for the negotiation of a new partnership with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 25 February 2020 European Commission, Draft text of the Agreement on the New Partnership with the United Kingdom, 18 March 2020 HM Government, The Future Relationship with the EU – The UK’s Approach to Negotiations, February 2020 UK Negotiating Team, Draft working text for an agreement on energy, 19 May 2020 Detailed information on the provisions in the UK draft energy agreement are available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre’s (SPICe) paper on EU-UK Future Relationship Negotiations – UK Legal Text Special, 2 June 2020  76  77  78 79  23 Commons Library Briefing, 19 June 2020  congestion management, no network charges, and participating in compensation mechanisms. The UK text also contains technical provisions for trade in electricity which are not included in the EU text, including the use of balancing platforms and market coupling over different timeframes (see Box 1). The draft agreement includes an Annex of the Regulations that would continue to apply in GB as requirements for the UK’s balancing and trading proposals. •  Participation in bodies: The UK text states that UK bodies will participate as observers in meetings of ENTSO-G and ACER and members of ENTSO-E. The EU text states the parties will develop working arrangements for cooperation with ENSTO-E, ENTSO-G and ACER though states clearly that this shall not involve membership of these bodies (see Box 2).  •  Offshore energy: Both texts refer to cooperation in development of offshore energy. The UK text refers to the parties supporting the other’s “full participation” in voluntary structures established for such cooperation between the North Sea Countries. This may refer to The North Sea Energy Cooperation which the UK reportedly wished to attend after its departure as part of EU Withdrawal. The EU text refers only to cooperation on such projects through “sharing best practice” and “facilitating the development” of specific projects.  •  Governance: The UK text includes provisions for a framework for consultation and dispute resolution, including the use of a Panel of Experts, and the establishment of an Energy Cooperation Group to administer the Agreement. The EU text does not include either proposal. Instead for all sectors, the EU proposes a joint EUUK governing body (the Partnership Council) with specialised sectoral committees. More information on the differing negotiating positions on Governance and other areas is available in the Library briefing paper on The UK-EU future relationship negotiations: summary of positions.  •  Other provisions: there is also broad overlap between the two texts on some further provisions of energy trading. Both include commitments on the exchange of information, market-based prices, and non-discriminatory access to energy transport infrastructure, and requirements for transparent system operators and independent regulatory authorities. The EU text contains further provisions not covered by the UK text, such as on the exploration and production of energy goods, offshore risk and safety, gas preventative action plans and emergency plans, and electricity risk preparedness.  Statements from the negotiating parties have indicated that there may be differences of opinion regarding energy in the negotiations. In his 15 May remarks following Round 3 of negotiations, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier included electricity interconnectors in a list of what he regarded as the “many areas [where the UK is] looking to maintain the benefits of being a Member State, without the obligations”. Specifically, Barnier said the UK’s demands included “to obtain electricity  24 Brexit: Energy and Climate Change  interconnection mechanisms equivalent to the Single Market – ‘existing arrangements’ as the UK says.” 80 From the UK side, in a 24 April 2020 Statement in response to the second round of negotiations, the UK Government listed energy as a core area of a Free Trade Agreement where that had been some “promising convergence”. 81 The fourth round of negotiations were completed in June 2020. While neither Michel Barnier (representing the EU) 82 nor David Frost (representing the UK) 83 specifically mentioned energy in their respective statements, both said overall progress had been limited. Examples of energy agreements between the EU and other non-EU members are set out in Box 3 below.  Commentary Before the UK’s departure from the European Union, stakeholders expressed support for continued participation in the IEM. In January 2018, the Lords EU environment and energy sub-committee’s report on Energy Security said “none of our witnesses expressed a desire to leave the IEM” and concluded “there is strong support across the energy industry for the UK to continue to participate in the Internal Energy Market (IEM) post-Brexit.” The key benefits cited by witnesses were the efficiency savings made from market coupling and options to exchange information. 84 In response to the publication of the February 2020 draft EU treaty and May 2020 draft UK energy agreement on the future relationship, EU and UK energy trade bodies released a statement calling for “an efficient future energy EU-UK relationship”. This commented on several areas of the texts, including calling or cooperation and collaborating between regulators and system operators through UK participation of bodies such as ACER, ENTSO, and further details on maintaining collaboration on offshore projects in the North Sea. On electricity and gas trading, this stated further details were needed on how to maintain efficient trading: Efficient cross-border trading, supported by harmonised trading rules and regulatory cooperation, supports security of supply and low energy bills for all consumers, while helping to balance the penetration of renewable generation. So we welcome that both sides agree on the need and the benefits of efficient and costeffective trading over interconnectors. Further details are needed on how this can be achieved with clear and transparent rules that do not discriminate. We would suggest that the framework  80  81 82  83  84  European Commission, Remarks by Michel Barnier following Round 3 of negotiations for a new partnership between the EU and the UK, 15 May 2020 No 10 media blog, Statement on Round Two of UK-EU negotiations, 24 April 2020 European Commission, Statement by Michel Barnier following Round 4 of negotiations for a new partnership between the European Union and the United Kingdom, 5 June 2020 Gov.uk, No 10 media blog, David Frost’s statement following the conclusion of round 4 of negotiations with the EU, 5 June 2020 Lords EU Committee, Brexit: energy security, 10th Report of Session 2017-19, HL Paper 63, 29 January 2018  25 Commons Library Briefing, 19 June 2020  presented in the UK legal text is more likely to achieve such an outcome. 85  Box 3: Existing energy agreements The EU states clearly in its negotiating directives Q&A that there are no other countries that have energy relationship models with the EU that are directly comparable with what is being sought by the UK: In the area of electricity and gas, there is no precedent for this type of arrangement. The Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology’s note on Overseas Electricity Interconnection set out that some non-Member states participate in the IEM, to varying levels of integration. For example, EEA members participate fully. They must adopt and automatically update a substantial amount of EU energy and environment legislation to do so. The IEM’s legal framework falls under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. The House of Lords EU Committee’s 2018 report on Brexit and Energy Security, considered the models for Norway and Switzerland: • •  Norway, as an EEA and EFTA member, is also a member of the IEM. The Committee said a similar agreement would bring benefits but noted the Government had ruled it out. Switzerland has access to European energy markets through bilateral agreements, though it is excluded from market coupling (see Box 1). As part of this, Switzerland accepts some EU regulations, including the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Switzerland sits physically at the centre of the EU energy system and is a key transit country for energy trading with over 40 interconnectors to its neighbours.  The Committee quotes the Head of International Energy Affairs at the Swiss Federal Office of Energy Jean-Christophe Füeg - as saying that Switzerland’s exclusion from market coupling resulted in “trade between Switzerland and the rest of is handled in a suboptimal way”. Füeg also reflected on participating in the IEM: The EU wants to have an internal electricity market as one coherent thing, and either you are in it and abide by the rules or you are not in it. [For an exception to be made,] you have to have a very strong case that you as a country bring something to the internal electricity market that is indispensable to the functioning of the energy market […] I am not aware of the UK having anything that I would call a unique selling point; that is, something that you would bring to the IEM, both electricity and gas, which in the countervailing scenario of you not bringing it to the market would put the IEM in some sort of jeopardy. Conversely, the Minister, Richard Harrington MP, highlighted three features unique to the UK: The first is bulk—our size relative to the Swiss and, therefore, our importance to the Single Market. The second is history—the fact that we helped to form it. Thirdly, there is the fact that we are already in it, unlike the Swiss, who are not. On the Swiss experience relating to the UK, the Committee concluded that: The Swiss experience shows that mutual benefits and a history within the system are no guarantee of EU energy market access. While the Government appears confident that a postBrexit energy relationship with the EU will favour the UK, we are concerned that this confidence is based on a misplaced expectation of pragmatism and that broader political considerations may affect the degree to which the UK can engage with the IEM post-Brexit.  85  Energy UK, EU and UK trade bodies call for an efficient future energy EU-UK relationship, 3 June 2020  26 Brexit: Energy and Climate Change  Other agreements also exist, such as the Energy Community, a multilateral framework between nine Southeast and East European countries and the EU to integrate their energy markets. However, the key objective of the Energy Community is to extend the EU internal energy market rules and principles beyond on the basis of a legally binding framework called the Energy Community Acquis.  27 Commons Library Briefing, 19 June 2020  4. Implications for the island of Ireland Energy policy is largely devolved to the Northern Ireland Executive, and the sector has different characteristics to those in Great Britain. This means there are specific energy policy issues. Some issues have been addressed in the Withdrawal Agreement, but there are also possible impacts from the UK’s relationship with the IEM (above) which will be addressed as part of the future relationship negotiations. Background information is available in the Northern Ireland Assembly Research and Information Service Briefing paper on Withdrawal Agreement, Protocol and Political Declaration – potential implications for the Single Electricity Market in Northern Ireland (May 2020).  4.1 The Single Electricity Market (SEM) Since 2007, the island of Ireland has operated with a Single Electricity Market (SEM). This allows free trade of power across the island, with all generators and suppliers trading through a central mandatory wholesale market. It is regulated jointly by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) from the Republic of Ireland, and the Utility Regulator from Northern Ireland. 86 The decision-making body which governs the market is the SEM Committee. This body consists of the CER, the Utility Regulator as well as an independent member (who also has a deputy). The SEM is established in national law in both the UK and Ireland, and is not the result of laws transposed directly from any EU-level legislation. However, the SEM has undergone significant change in order to comply with wider EU legislation and existing arrangements have (as of October 2018) been replaced by an enhanced wholesale market. This market has been called the Integrated Single Electricity Market or I-SEM, though as the enhanced market is still commonly referred to as the SEM, this paper will use the terms interchangeably. 87 I-SEM is designed closely around the rules of the Internal Energy Market (IEM), meaning it uses market coupling for trading energy established by the European Network Codes, as described above. The imports and exports of electricity between GB, Northern Ireland and Ireland (ROI) have fluctuated over time. In 2018, the island of Ireland was a net importer of electricity from the UK: the ROI is a net importer of electricity from Northern Ireland but is overall a net exporter to the UK through the Wales interconnector and Northern Ireland is a net importer of electricity from the Scottish Moyle Link even though it also exports to ROI. 88  86 87  88  CER Factsheet on the Single Electricity Market, April 2011 Information note, Proposed Amendment to the Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (Single Market) Act 2007 Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Energy Trends. Table 5.6  28 Brexit: Energy and Climate Change  Considerations for the Future Relationship The Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland in the Withdrawal Agreement provides for the continuation of the SEM after the transition period ends, including continued participation by Northern Ireland operators in the EU emissions trading scheme. More detail on the provisions in the Protocol is set out in section 4.2 below While the Protocol facilitates the continued operation of the SEM, the UK’s future relationship with the IEM could impact the SEM. As the island of Ireland’s only physical connections for gas and electricity to mainland Europe are via GB, the future of energy trading between the UK and the EU is key for the future of electricity import efficiency and security on the island. The Northern Ireland Assembly Research and Information service summarise the issue in their May 2020 paper on the SEM: The UK Government [states] that from 1 January 2021 cross border flows into and out of GB will no longer be governed by EU legislation. This means that new trading relationships may be required for trade between the GB market and the SEM via interconnectors. The extent to which new arrangements are necessary will depend on the outcome of the future relationship negotiations between the UK and the EU and any agreement reached on electricity trade. The UK Government, however, has stated that “trade on interconnectors may be less efficient” after the transition period. 89  Unlike the electricity sector, the gas markets of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland are separate. The Republic of Ireland’s gas sector relies on imports of gas through Great Britain. This reliance on imports highlights that any future relationship on energy will be important not only for the UK’s demand for energy, but also the flow of energy from the UK to EU countries such as Ireland. 9091 Gas trading was not covered in the Withdrawal Agreement, but is referred to in the UK’s draft energy agreement 92 (see below).  4.2 Negotiating positions for the Future Relationship Following the EU referendum vote, representatives from both Northern Ireland and Ireland stressed that energy, and the SEM, should be a priority in the Brexit negotiations to prevent any risks to the market. 93‘ 94  89  90  91  92 93  94  Northern Ireland Assembly Research and Information Service Briefing paper, Withdrawal Agreement, Protocol and Political Declaration – potential implications for the Single Electricity Market in Northern Ireland, May 2020 Department for the Economy, Northern Ireland Executive (BES0059), November 2017 Irish Government, Ireland and the negotiations on the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union The Government’s Approach, May 2017, p. 38 UK Negotiating Team, Draft working text for an agreement on energy, 19 May 2020 Northern Ireland Executive Office, Letter to Prime Minister from First Minister and Deputy First Minister, 10 August 2016 Irish Government, Ireland and the negotiations on the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union The Government’s Approach, May 2017, p. 38  29 Commons Library Briefing, 19 June 2020  2018 White Paper and previous Withdrawal Agreement The May Government’s July 2018 White Paper on the Future Relationship between the UK and the EU said the Government was “committed to facilitating the continuation of the SEM” and would “work with the EU to ensure the SEM is maintained in any scenario.” 95 The 2018 Withdrawal Agreement negotiated between the May Government and the EU included a reference to the SEM in the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol. The Protocol stated that some EU law governing wholesale electricity markets would continue to apply, should the protocol come into force. The legislation related to the generation, transportation and wholesale and cross-border trading of electricity, but not retail markets or consumer protection. The legislation included the rules for the IEM, the Directive that established ACER, the industrial emissions Directive on pollution prevention and control, and the Directive establishing the EU emissions trading scheme (EU ETS). This Withdrawal Agreement was not ratified and was superseded by the 2019 Withdrawal Agreement. More information on the approach to energy in the previous Withdrawal Agreement is available in Section 8.6 of the Library briefing paper on The UK’s EU Withdrawal Agreement (April 2019)  The Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration The Johnson Government renegotiated the Withdrawal Agreement in 2019. This new Withdrawal Agreement was ratified by both Parties and entered into force on 1 February 2020. The provisions relating to the SEM remained the same as the previous Withdrawal Agreement, but the implementation of the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol changed. Under the May Government, the protocol was described as a “back-stop” and was a temporary position in the case of no agreement at the end of the transition period. The Johnson renegotiation means the protocol will come into force at the end of the transition period and be the permanent end state for Northern Ireland, unless the Northern Ireland Assembly votes to change it. This means the SEM will continue to operate across the island of Ireland at the end of the transition period and Northern Ireland will remain subject to certain EU rules. 96 The Political Declaration does not specifically mention the SEM, though contains general provisions on “cooperation” on electricity and gas trading between the parties (see section 3.4). Both the EU and UK have published documents on the implementation of the Protocol. The EU document urges the UK to provide details and 95  96  HM Government, The Future Relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, 12 July 2018, Cm 9593, para 138 Background information on the Northern Ireland protocol is available in the Library insight on Brexit and the Northern Ireland border.  30 Brexit: Energy and Climate Change  timelines for implementation. 97 The UK document states the Protocol will be implemented by the Northern Ireland Executive with support from the UK Government, though does not give timelines. 98 The House of Lords EU Select Committee published a report on The Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland in May 2020 stating: We welcome the commitment in Article 9 and Annex 4 of the Protocol to the continuation of the Single Electricity Market on the island of Ireland. This will benefit Northern Ireland and Ireland in terms of energy security, decarbonisation and energy prices. 99  EU and UK Future Relationship Negotiating Positions On 18 March 2020, the EU published a draft treaty including provisions on energy trading. 100 On 19 May 2020, the UK Government published a series of documents setting out its approach to the negotiations on the future relationship with the EU, including a draft energy agreement. 101 The Single Electricity Market is not specifically mentioned in either the EU draft treaty, or the UK draft agreement on energy. However, as explained further above, as the island’s only physical connections for gas and electricity to mainland Europe are via GB, the provisions related to the IEM (section 3 above) will likely be relevant to the SEM. The UK’s approach to the negotiations, published in February 2020, does refer to the SEM: The UK has undertaken domestic preparations to enable trade in electricity and gas over the interconnectors to continue from 1 January 2021 without an energy agreement. Existing arrangements, including work carried out with regulators and Transmissions System Operators, will ensure security of energy supply is unaffected. In Northern Ireland, the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol to the Withdrawal Agreement provides the basis for the continued operation of the Single Electricity Market. An energy agreement covering electricity and gas trading could improve these baseline arrangements by: a. facilitating efficient cross-border electricity and gas trade; b. facilitating technical cooperation between electricity and gas network operators and organisations in the planning and use of energy infrastructure connecting their systems; and c. supporting the integration of renewable power and investment in decarbonisation projects in the north seas.  The UK draft energy agreement does make a reference to the continuation of supply of natural gas, stating its provisions apply “without prejudice to the obligations that apply between the United European Commission, Technical note on the implementation of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland, 30 April 2020 98 Cabinet Office, The UK’s Approach to the Northern Ireland Protocol, May 2020 99 House of Lords European Union Committee, The Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland, 1 June 2020, para 208 100 European Commission, Draft text of the Agreement on the New Partnership with the United Kingdom, 18 March 2020 101 UK Negotiating Team, Draft working text for an agreement on energy, 19 May 2020 97  31 Commons Library Briefing, 19 June 2020  Kingdom and Ireland under the United Kingdom and Ireland natural gas treaties.” 102 The fourth round of negotiations were completed in June 2020. While neither Michel Barnier (representing the EU) 103 nor David Frost (representing the UK) 104 specifically mentioned energy in their respective statements, both said overall progress had been limited.  Commentary In response to the publication of EU and UK texts on the future relationship, EU and UK energy trade bodies released a statement, including concerns for the SEM: While the Northern Ireland Protocol protects the SEM on the island of Ireland, it is limited to the functioning on the island and does not cover the trading between the SEM and Great Britain. This means that as it stands there are no arrangements in place to maintain the Day-ahead market between GB and Ireland and no mechanisms to enable the collaboration of GB and SEM regulators on cross-border matters. The Energy deal will need to address these deficiencies to ensure that Ireland continues to function according the IEM rules and to ensure that customers on the island of Ireland are not penalised with higher prices resulting from lesser levels of efficiency and segmented, less liquid markets. The wind resources that can be activated in Ireland are greater than are likely to be used in Ireland, so the decarbonisation of Europe overall is advanced by enabling integration and cooperation. 105  The Northern Ireland Assembly Research and Information Service briefing paper on the SEM (May 2020) prepared for the NI Committee for the Economy, identified numerous questions on the implementation of the Protocol for the SEM. These included possible impacts on security of supply and end user prices from potential inefficient interconnection, implementation of EU law in Northern Ireland, and scrutiny of future cooperation. 106 Before the UK left the EU, a number of select committees assessed the potential impact of Brexit on the SEM. The House of Commons Northern Ireland Affairs Committee 107 and BEIS Committee each recommended that the Government protect the continued operation of SEM. 108 The House of Lords EU and Environment Sub-Committee concluded that the “complexity of maintaining the I-SEM will increase significantly” if the UK leaves the IEM and said the UK should plan for UK Negotiating Team, Draft working text for an agreement on energy, 19 May 2020 European Commission, Statement by Michel Barnier following Round 4 of negotiations for a new partnership between the European Union and the United Kingdom, 5 June 2020 104 Gov.uk, No 10 media blog, David Frost’s statement following the conclusion of round 4 of negotiations with the EU, 5 June 2020 105 Energy UK, EU and UK trade bodies call for an efficient future energy EU-UK relationship, 3 June 2020 106 Northern Ireland Assembly Research and Information Service Briefing paper, Withdrawal Agreement, Protocol and Political Declaration – potential implications for the Single Electricity Market in Northern Ireland, May 2020 107 Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, Electricity sector in Northern Ireland, Third Report of Session 2016–17, HC 51, 26 April 2017 108 BEIS Committee, Leaving the EU: negotiation priorities for energy and climate change policy, Fourth Report of Session 2016–17, HC909, 2 May 2017 102 103  32 Brexit: Energy and Climate Change  this eventuality, including by considering whether to devolve additional powers to Northern Ireland. 109  109  Lords EU Committee, Brexit: energy security, 10th Report of Session 2017-19, HL Paper 63, 29 January 2018, para.149-150  33 Commons Library Briefing, 19 June 2020  5. Climate Change The UK is part of an international effort to combat climate change. Both the UK and the EU are parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and as such have signed up to international climate change obligations, such as the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement. As part of its contributions to international efforts, the UK has domestic legislation and policies in place to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Climate Change Act 2008 originally established long term statutory targets for the UK to achieve an 80% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2050 against a 1990 baseline (translated into five-yearly carbon budgets). In June 2019, the Government amended this headline target to a 100% reduction (compared to 1990 levels) by 2050 (otherwise known as net zero). Since 1990, the UK has cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40%. 110 Further discussion of the UK carbon budgets and the Climate Change Act 2008 (as amended) is set out in the Library Briefing on UK Carbon Budgets and the Library Briefing on Legislating for Net Zero. The UK also contributes to international efforts by participating in EU mechanisms such as the EU emissions trading system (EU ETS); and meeting EU targets, for example under the “effort sharing” legislation. The House of Lords Library briefing on Leaving the European Union: UK Climate Change Policy (July 2017) provides further background on climate change policies. In December 2019 the European Commission published a communication called The European Green Deal. 111 It is described as resetting “the Commission’s commitment to tackling climate and environmental-related challenges that is this generation’s defining task.” 112 It presented an initial roadmap of the key policies and measures needed to achieve a number of goals. The European Commission presented a proposal for a European Climate Law on 4 March 2020, which included a net zero by 2050 target. 113 The European Green Deal also includes proposals for a carbon border adjustment mechanism, which would apply a price to the carbon content of goods imported into the EU market. 114 During the transition period, the UK must continue applying and implementing EU law that falls within the scope of the Withdrawal  Committee on Climate Change, Reducing UK emissions, 2019 Progress Report to Parliament, 10 July 2019 111 European Commission website, A European Green Deal [accessed 26 February 2020] 112 European Commission, Communication from the Commission, The European Green Deal, COM(2019) 640 final, 11 December 2019 113 European Commission proposal for a regulation: European Climate law, 4 March 2020; and Europa pages on European Climate Law [accessed 16 March 2020] 114 European Commission website, A European Green Deal [accessed 11 June 2020] 110  34 Brexit: Energy and Climate Change  Agreement. This includes remaining a full participant in the EU emissions trading scheme (see below). 115  5.1 Negotiating positions of the EU and the UK Government The precise nature of the future relationship between the UK and EU on climate change policies is unclear as negotiations are ongoing. Both the EU and the UK Government have set out their general positions and proposals on climate change at various points in the negotiation process. Some of the key positions are summarised below. Further detail on the latest negotiating positions is included with the relevant policy sections of this chapter.  2017-18  The Clean Growth Strategy (October 2017) explained the Government’s view of the potential impact of leaving the EU on climate change policies, stating that domestic commitments would not be affected, but that the exact nature of the UK’s future relationship with the EU, including in areas such as the EU ETS were “still to be determined”: Leaving the EU will not affect our statutory commitments under our own domestic Climate Change Act and indeed our domestic binding emissions reduction targets are more ambitious than those set by EU legislation. The exact nature of the UK’s future relationship with the EU and the long-term shape of our involvement in areas like the EU Emissions Trading System are still to be determined. There are also emerging opportunities to drive more action – for example by putting emission reductions and land stewardship at the heart of a post EU agricultural support policy. We will therefore carefully examine each area of common interest with our EU partners and work to deliver policies and programmes that are at least as beneficial as the current arrangements. 116  The European Council’s guidelines on the framework for future EU-UK relations (23 March 2018) 117 included a new Article requiring continued “close cooperation” in relation to global challenges, “in particular in the areas of climate change and sustainable development, as well as crossborder pollution”. 118 This approach was reflected in the subsequently agreed Political Declaration on the Framework for the Future Relationship, as below. The May Government’s White Paper on the Future Relationship between the UK and the EU (12 July 2018) 119 committed to “maintaining high standards on climate change” and continuing to  Gov.uk, Meeting climate change requirements from 1 January 2021, 28 April 2020 [accessed 3 June 2020] 116 Gov.uk, Clean Growth Strategy, 12 October 2017 117 European Council, Article 50 Guidelines, 23 March 2018 118 European Council, Article 50 Guidelines, 23 March 2018.

This was superseded by the 2019 Withdrawal Agreement and was not ratified.  2019 In a May 2019 consultation document on the Future of UK Carbon Pricing, the UK Government and devolved Administrations stated that (rather than remaining in the EU ETS) securing a linking agreement with the EU for a linked UK ETS was their preferred option. Alternative carbon pricing options were also consulted on to address a scenario where a linking agreement cannot be secured with the EU. 121 The consultation closed on 12 July 2019 and the Government published its response on 1 June 2020. 122 It confirmed that the Government would establish a UK ETS and was open to it being linked to the EU ETS. On 19 August 2019, Prime Minister Johnson wrote to the President of the European Council (Donald Tusk) stating that: Although we will remain committed to world-class environmental, product and labour standards, the laws and regulations to deliver them will potentially diverge from those of the EU. That is the point of our exit and our ability to enable this is central to our future democracy. 123  2020 The ratified Withdrawal Agreement came into force on 1 February 2020. It does not contain any specific provisions or exceptions on climate change. The Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland contained within the Withdrawal Agreement does not contain the level playing field provisions (including in relation to climate change) of the May Government’s Withdrawal Agreement. Article 9 of the Protocol the continues the operation of the Single Electricity Market in Northern Ireland from the end of the transition period, which includes Northern Ireland remaining in the EU emissions trading scheme (see more in section 4.2 above). The Political Declaration commits the parties to global cooperation on climate change and reaffirming commitments to international agreements such as the Paris Agreement. It also includes commitments from both parties to ensure a ‘level playing field’ in the future relationship with regard to a number of different matters including climate change. 124 This remains the same as the May Government’s Political Declaration.

The Prime Minister’s written statement on 3 February 2020 stated that the Government would not agree to measures in climate change policy and other level playing field areas going “beyond those typically included in a comprehensive free trade agreement”. The statement set out the Government’s belief that the two parties should recognise their respective commitments to maintaining high standards, agreeing to avoid using trade distorting measures and “confirm that they will uphold their international obligations”. 125 The EU’s negotiating directives were adopted on 25 February 2020. 126 The envisaged partnership included the “fight against climate change” as a key objective, specifically mentioning that the Paris Agreement should constitute an essential element. In section 15 on level playing field and sustainability, climate change is included as an area in which the envisaged partnership should “uphold common high standards, and corresponding high standards over time with Union standards as a reference point”. 127 More information on the level playing field is available in the Library Briefing Paper on the UK-EU future relationship negotiations: level playing field The UK Government’s policy paper: the future relationship with the EU, the UK’s approach to negotiations (27 February 2020) 128 did not include climate change within the proposals for a comprehensive free trade agreement. Instead, climate change and carbon trading were included under a proposed Agreement on Energy (the text of which was published by the Government later in May 2020). It stated that “the UK is open to considering an agreement on energy if it reflects its interests and as long as it respects the fact that the UK will make independent decisions on its energy policies”. The European Commission published a draft treaty text on 18 March 2020. 129 In line with the negotiating directives, the EU included the fight against climate change as an “essential element” of the partnership as well as within the level playing field provisions. The UK Government published the ten draft treaty texts it had tabled in the negotiations on 19 May 2020. In line with its approach to date, it included climate change within its draft energy agreement text, rather than in its draft comprehensive free trade agreement. The draft energy agreement includes draft provisions on “the fight against climate change” in line with the Government’s command paper and a placeholder on carbon pricing rather than detailed legal provisions HCWS86 [on UK / EU relations] 3 February 2020 Council of the EU, ANNEX to COUNCIL DECISION authorising the opening of negotiations with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for a new partnership agreement, 25 February 2020 127 EU negotiating directives, para 94 128 HM Government, The future relationship with the EU, the UK’s approach to negotiations, 27 February 2020, CP211 129 European Commission, Draft text of the Agreement on the New Partnership with the United Kingdom, 18 March 2020 125 126  37 Commons Library Briefing, 19 June 2020  (noting that it will be subject to further discussions). The energy agreement has separate governance arrangements to the trade agreement (see section 3.4 above). The UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, wrote to Michel Barnier on 19 May 2020 stating that the UK is committed to high standards but could not accept the EU’s level playing field proposals: We have been clear that the UK will have high standards and, in many cases, higher standards than those in the EU. However, we cannot accept any alignment with EU rules, the appearance of EU law concepts, or commitments around internal monitoring and enforcement that are inappropriate for an FTA. 130  Reports from the fourth round of negotiations in June 2020 was that no significant progress was made in reaching an agreement. 131  Further information For more information on the UK and EU’s negotiating positions, see: •  Library Briefing paper on The UK-EU future relationship: summary of positions  •  Library Briefing paper on The UK-EU future relationship: the March 2020 EU draft treaty and negotiations update, 27 May 2020  •  Library Briefing paper on The UK-EU future relationship: Level playing field  Some key areas of climate change policy subject to ongoing negotiations between the UK and EU are discussed below.  5.2 International framework The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted during the 1992 Earth Summit, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It entered into force in 1994 and has been ratified by 196 States (including both the EU and the UK) which constitute the “Parties” to the Convention. The objective of the Treaty, set out in article 2 of the Convention, is to “stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.” Every year a Conference of the Parties takes place (known as COPs). The UK will host COP26 in November 2021 and Italy will host the preCOP events. COP26 was postponed from 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. For more information see the Library Briefing Paper on COP26: the international climate change conference, Glasgow, UK.  The Kyoto Protocol The Kyoto Protocol was adopted at COP3 in Kyoto in 1997 and entered into force in February 2005, with two commitment periods (2008-2012 and 2013-2020). Its main goal is to reduce certain greenhouse gas  130 131  Gov.uk Letter to Michel Barnier, 19 May 2020 Politico, No significant progress in Brexit talks, 6 May 2020 [accessed 16 June 2020]  38 Brexit: Energy and Climate Change  emissions 132 and parties to the Protocol (including the UK) must meet their targets primarily through national measures. An additional means by which Parties can meet their targets is through the market-based mechanisms established by the Protocol: the clean development mechanism; joint implementation; and emissions trading. The UK’s national Kyoto Protocol Registry is located within the Consolidated System of European Registries and facilitates the trading of Kyoto Protocol emissions units. 133 Under the Kyoto Protocol, EU countries (and Iceland) have agreed a joint commitment to meet a 20% reduction target compared to 1990 levels. This is in line with the EU’s own 2020 targets. 134 EU countries meet these targets through the EU ETS and, for sectors not in the EU ETS, through the “effort sharing decision” which sets binding annual national emission reduction targets. 135 The UK is a party to the UNFCCC and has ratified the Kyoto Protocol separately to the EU. The Government has confirmed it remains committed to meeting its international climate change obligations. 136 Subject to any extension, the end of the transition period (31 December 2020) will align with the end of the second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol. The Withdrawal Agreement ensures that certain reporting obligations relating to 2019 and 2020 continue to apply to the UK until the end of the second commitment period of the Kyoto Period (2013-20). 137 During the transition period, UK businesses continue to have access to the Kyoto Protocol National Registry within the UK section of the Consolidated System of European Registries, and can continue to access their accounts.  The Paris Agreement In December 2015, agreement was reached at COP21 in Paris to keep a global temperature rise this century well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5°C. 138 Both the EU and the UK are signatories to the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement requires each Party to prepare, communicate and maintain successive (every 5 years) nationally determined contributions (NDCs) of the emissions reductions that it intends to achieve. NDCs were first submitted by Parties in 2015. Parties are expected to put forward enhanced or updated NDCs in 2020. The EU currently has an  Six greenhouse gases for the first commitment period; seven greenhouse gases for the second commitment period. 133 More information on the mechanisms is available on the UNFCCC pages: Mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol. 134 European Commission, Climate Action, Kyoto 2nd commitment period (2013-2020) [accessed 8 November 2018] 135 See: European Commission, Climate Action, Effort sharing: Member States’ emissions targets [accessed 8 November 2018] 136 See: Gov.uk Meeting climate change requirements if there’s no Brexit deal, updated 12 April 2019 [accessed 26 July 2019] 137 Article 96 138 UNFCCC, The Paris Agreement [accessed 3 August 2017] 132  39 Commons Library Briefing, 19 June 2020  overall NDC on behalf of its Member States (including the UK), acting jointly. COP25 was held in Madrid, Spain with a key aim to finalise the “Paris rulebook” in order to ensure full implementation from 2020. However, the talks did not reach the consensus hoped for with some of the more technical elements pushed out to COP26 in the UK. Further information is available in the Library Briefing Paper on Chile Madrid Climate change conference: COP25; and the Library Briefing Paper on COP26: the international climate change conference, Glasgow, UK. Background information is available in the House of Commons Library Briefing Papers on the Paris Climate Change Conference (27 September 2016) and the Paris Agreement and Marrakech Climate Conference (25 November 2017).  The future relationship The UK is a party to the UNFCCC and has ratified the Paris Agreement separately from the EU. 139 The Government has confirmed it remains committed to the Paris Agreement and that it will continue to be bound by the Paris Agreement as an individual party under international law. The Government guidance states: The UK will also remain a Party to international climate change agreements, including the Paris Agreement. Its commitment to them will remain as strong as ever and will be unaffected by leaving the EU. 140  The UK has confirmed it will submit “its own increased NDC” in advance of COP26: Following our departure from the EU, the UK will be bringing forward its own, increased NDC well ahead of COP26. The UK NDC will be built on the foundations of well-established UK analysis and policy development for domestic climate change mitigation, used to set the UK’s fifth carbon budget (2028-32) and described in the Clean Growth Strategy. In its Net Zero advice, the Committee on Climate Change was clear that the Clean Growth Strategy continues to offer the right framework for the ambitious action needed to deliver net zero. 141  The EU has been silent on the possibility of formally requesting the UK to continue to participate in joint fulfilment of a new NDC. It has said: In 2020, the EU will update its NDC as agreed in Paris, taking into account the need to increase clarity, transparency and understanding of its NDC. 142  An independent climate change think tank, E3G, published a report on Climate change in the Brexit negotiations (May 2020) which explains the impact of the UK leaving the EU on the EU’s NDC ambitions: Gov.uk news story, UK ratifies the Paris Agreement, 18 November 2016 [accessed 30 August 2018] 140 Gov.uk, Meeting climate change requirements from 1 January 2021, 28 April 2020 [accessed 3 June 2020] 141 PQ 12820 [on climate change] 14 February 2020 142 Council of the EU, Preparations for UNFCCC meetings, 4 October 2019 139  40 Brexit: Energy and Climate Change  The withdrawal of the UK from the EU effort sharing regulation makes increasing EU ambition more difficult. The UK, like other larger and richer countries, took on a more ambitious share of the EU target than the EU average. Privately several EU Member States and Parliamentarians have expressed concern that the UK’s absence may limit the ability to agree an ambitious new target, especially the 55% reduction at the top end of the considered range. 143  Negotiating positions The latest negotiating positions from each party in relation to international climate change obligations and the Paris Agreement, and their interaction with domestic law and policy, are set out below. UK position  EU position  Within its draft Energy Agreement (published May 2020), the UK proposals include that: • the Parties each affirm their commitment to effectively implement the Paris Agreement; • each Party retains the right to establish its own climate change priorities and to adopt or modify its laws and policies accordingly • each Party shall seek to ensure […] high levels of climate protection, and shall strive to continue to improve such laws and policies  The EU draft treaty text (March 2020) proposals include as ”essential elements” to the agreement, that: • each Party shall respect the Paris Agreement and the process set by UNFCCC, and refrain from any acts or omissions that would undermine its adherence to or materially defeat the object and purpose of the Paris Agreement • the Parties shall advocate the fight against climate change in international fora, including by engaging with other countries and regions to increase their level of ambition in the reduction of greenhouse emissions Within the Level Playing Field Provisions, the EU includes: • each Party shall effectively implement the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement.  Commentary In September 2018, businesses and industry bodies called on the then UK Prime Minister and President of the European Commission to agree to cooperate on implementing the Paris Agreement as one of several negotiating priorities on energy and climate change set out in an open letter. 144 A report from E3G (a climate change think tank) on Brexit and  Climate cooperation, Implications for the Paris Agreement and net zero E3G Briefing Paper, Climate change in the Brexit negotiations, Shane Tomlinson, May 2020 [accessed 16 June 2020] 144 Open letter to Jean-Claude Juncker and Theresa May, Prioritising EU27 / UK cooperation on climate change and energy, 4 September 2018, signed by British Irish Chamber of Commerce, EDF, Electricity Association of Ireland, Energy UK, Earth Capital Partners, Renewable UK, Unilever, WHEB, WindEurope, Loftbergs [accessed 5 September 2018] 143  41 Commons Library Briefing, 19 June 2020  (October 2018) made a number of recommendations, including that the EU and the UK should agree a broad scope for climate cooperation and that a decision by the UK to set out an independent NDC would still be compatible with high levels of climate cooperation with the EU (see more below). 145 On 6 May 2020, the Financial Times reported that the EU desire to include commitment to the Paris Agreement among the essential elements of the future partnership was a source of disagreement with the UK in the negotiations. 146 The EU indicated that it wants such a commitment in all its future trade deals. A Government spokesperson said the UK was “absolutely committed to tackling climate change” but that it was opposed to embedding legally binding pledges into any deal with the EU: “The agreements we reach with the EU should reaffirm both parties’ commitments to the Paris agreement and recognise both sides’ right to decide their own regulation to meet our respective climate goals,” the spokesperson said. “This does not require an additional binding international legal commitment.” 147  In June 2020, a group of EU and UK energy trade bodies welcomed the commitments of both parties to international and domestic climate change goals: We welcome that both negotiating Parties remain fully committed to the goals of the Paris Agreement and to their own domestic legislations and climate targets. We are confident that considering the commitments in law and from governments, reaching zero emissions by 2050 remains the priority. 148  A blog by an environmental law lecturer at Sussex University argued that the EU’s proposal “poses virtually no threat unless the UK withdraws altogether from the Paris Agreement” Another potential area of concern is that the EU has listed upholding the Paris Agreement as an essential element of the Agreement (Article 5 of the ‘Common Provisions’ in the EU draft FTA), meaning that it could suspend the Agreement for noncompliance. This is not specific to the UK, and poses virtually no threat unless the UK withdraws altogether from the Paris Agreement, particularly considering that it allows countries to determine their own contributions to mitigating climate change. Indeed, as a climate leader, the UK might well advocate the inclusion of such conditionalities in its own FTAs. 149  An E3G report on Climate change in the Brexit negotiations (May 2020) identified the UK’s narrower approach to climate change (limiting it to references within the Energy Agreement) versus the EU’s wider E3G, Brexit and Climate cooperation, Implications for the Paris Agreement and net zero, 2 October 2019 [accessed 1 November 2018] 146 Financial Times, Brussels and Britain clash over climate conditions in trade deal, Jim Brunsden, 6 May 2020 [accessed 16 June 2020] [subscription needed] 147 Financial Times, Brussels and Britain clash over climate conditions in trade deal, Jim Brunsden, 6 May 2020 [accessed 16 June 2020] [subscription needed] 148 Energy UK, EU and UK trade bodies call for an efficient future energy EU-UK relationship, 3 June 2020 [accessed 12 June 2020] 149 UK Trade Policy Observatory, Environment and climate change in the EU-UK negotiations: Arguing the toss over nothing, blog by Dr Emily Lydgate [accessed 16 June 2020] 145  42 Brexit: Energy and Climate Change  approach in its main trade agreement. E3G argue that the UK should broaden its approach: The UK negotiating position on climate also needs revision. The current texts limit climate change and references to the Paris Agreement within the proposed energy agreement. This ignores the role of climate within transport, industry, agriculture and the environment. The UK should revise its position to include a climate change chapter and direct reference to the Paris Agreement in its main free trade agreement proposal as well as the separate energy agreement. 150  5.3 Carbon pricing There are two main types of carbon pricing: carbon taxes and emissions trading systems. 151  The UK’s participation in the EU ETS One of the main carbon pricing mechanisms in the UK is the EU emissions trading system (EU ETS). The UK also has a carbon price floor to support the EU ETS price (see Box 4). The UK remains a full participant in the EU ETS during the transition period. The EU ETS is described as the “largest multi-country, multi-sector greenhouse gas emissions trading system in the world” covering more than 11,000 power stations and industrial plants across the EU with around 1,000 of these in the UK. 152 153 The mandatory cap-and-trade scheme was launched in 2005 and has since undergone a number of reforms. It is central to the EU’s climate change target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. The EU ETS sets an EU-wide cap on the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions from energy intensive sectors including power stations and industrial plants. The cap decreases over time (1.74% each year) to reduce overall emissions. 154 Airlines operating between the 31 countries are covered within the EU ETS but via a separate cap. Approximately 140 UK-administered aircraft operators take part in the EU ETS. 155 Companies either receive allowances (EU Allowances or EUAs) free or purchase them during auctions of allowances issued by Governments. 156 Surplus allowances can also be traded on the carbon market. The number of allowances held by the company at the end of an EU ETS E3G Briefing Paper, Climate change in the Brexit negotiations, Shane Tomlinson, May 2020 [accessed 16 June 2020] 151 \More information is available on The World Bank, Pricing Carbon [accessed 16 June 2020] 152 BEIS, Participating in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), 31 July 2017 153 The greenhouse gases covered by EU ETS are carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs). 154 European Commission, Climate Action, ‘Emissions cap and allowances’, [accessed: 20 February 2018] 155 Gov.uk, Meeting climate change requirements if there’s no Brexit deal, 12 October 2018 156 Each allowance gives the holder the right to emit one tonne of carbon dioxide or the equivalent of nitrous oxide and perfluorocarbons. (EU Commission, Climate Action, ‘Emissions cap and allowances’, accessed 20 October 2016 150  43 Commons Library Briefing, 19 June 2020  year must be equal to, or more than, the total volume of emissions from its installation. Compliance is assessed and verified by an independent third party, and the company must surrender its allowances for the preceding calendar year by no later than 30 April the following year. The EU ETS is currently in Phase III (2013-2020), which aims for an overall emissions reduction of 21% compared to 2005 emissions for power stations and industrial plants. In Phase III, power stations purchase all their allowances whereas other industries still receive some of their EUAs via free allocation. Both sectors can also buy international credits from emission-saving projects around the world. 157 At the end of each year, if a company does not have enough EUAs to cover all its emissions it is required to pay a fine. 158 The market price of EUAs fell dramatically after the financial crisis in 2008 and stayed low for several years. From late 2011 until 2017, EUAs cost less than €10 per tonne 159 although in 2018 the price started to rise and reached over €28 in 2019. 160 In the earlier years, several Member States and various EU ETS stakeholders considered the EU carbon price to be too low to create a strong enough incentive for polluters to undertake the required investment in low-carbon technologies and to drive low-carbon innovation. As a result of the low prices, the EU introduced several measures to reduce the supply of allowances going forward, including removing surplus allowances from the market. The UK also responded to the issue of the low cost of carbon in 2013 by introducing the Carbon Price Floor (CPF), a UK-only carbon tax which supplements the price of carbon through the EU ETS (see Box 2). Since it was introduced, the CPF has increased the price of carbon for UK customers and helped to drive coal almost completely out of the UK energy mix. 161 There is no EU-wide floor price for EUA auctions. Box 4: Carbon price floor The Carbon Price Floor (CPF) is a UK Government policy implemented to support the EU ETS. The CPF taxes fossil fuels used to generate electricity via Carbon Price Support rates. The price floor consists of two components which are paid for by energy generators in two different ways: (i) the EU ETS allowance price; and (ii) the Carbon Price Support (CPS), which tops up the EU Allowance prices, as projected by the Government, to the carbon price floor target. The Treasury confirms the target carbon price and CPS rates three years in advance of delivery at each Budget, and all revenue from the CPF is retained by the Treasury. When the CPF was introduced, it was due to rise every year until 2020 (to a price of £30/tCO2). At Budget 2014 the Government announced that the CPS component of the floor price would be capped  European Commission, Climate Action, ‘Free allocation’, [accessed: 20 February 2018] 158 European Commission, Climate Action, ‘The EU Trading System (EU ETS)’, [accessed: 20 February 2018] 159 CarbonBrief, Q&A will the reformed EU ETS raise carbon prices? 6 December 2017 [accessed 3 September 2018] 160 EUAs were at EUR 21.06 on 31 August 2018 and EUR 28.99 on 26 July 2019 according to ICE EUA futures via Sandbag and Quandl. 161 BEIS, Coal Generation In Great Britain The pathway to a low-carbon future: consultation document, November 2016 157  44 Brexit: Energy and Climate Change  at a maximum of £18/tCO2 from 2016 to 2020 to limit the competitive disadvantage faced by business and reduce energy bills for consumers. This price freeze was extended to 2021 in Budget 2016. Budget 2018 stated that from 2021-22 the Government will seek to reduce the CPS if the total carbon price remains high. Background information on the carbon price floor is available in the House of Commons Library briefing: Carbon Price Floor (CPF) and the price support mechanism (8 January 2018),  The future relationship The UK will leave the EU ETS at the end of the transition period. Northern Ireland operators will remain in the EU ETS by virtue of the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol in the Withdrawal Agreement in relation to the continued operation of the Single Electricity Market in Ireland (see more in section 4 above). 162 The May Government committed in its Clean Growth Strategy (October 2017) to carbon pricing as a means of driving decarbonisation. 163 This has been reiterated by the current Government and the devolved Administrations throughout the negotiation process: The UK government and the devolved administrations are firmly committed to carbon pricing as an effective tool for achieving our carbon emissions reductions targets for net zero. 164  However, until June 2020, the type of carbon pricing the Government planned to implement at the end of the transition period was not known. Whether or not the UK’s future carbon pricing will be linked to the EU emissions trading system (EU ETS) remains subject to negotiations and is not yet known. The UK Government has said it “would be open to considering a link between a UK ETS and the EU ETS, if it suits both sides’ interests”. 165 In May 2019, the UK Government and the devolved Administrations launched a 12-week joint consultation on the “future of UK carbon pricing” (12 May-12 July 2019), which sought views on the approach to UK carbon pricing following Brexit. 166 The consultation set out a number of carbon pricing options. It identified the establishment of a UK national emissions trading system (UK ETS) linked to the EU ETS following the end of Phase III as the preferred option of the UK Government and the devolved Administrations. This approach is not without precedent. Although Switzerland is not a participant in the EU ETS, in November 2017 it signed an agreement (subject to ratification) to link its emissions trading system with the EU ETS.167 The agreement entered into force on 1 January 2020. Linking a UK ETS with the EU Article 9 and Annex 4 of the Ireland / Northern Ireland Protocol help to maintain the continued operation of the Single Electricity Market by providing for Northern Ireland power generators to continue to participate in the EU ETS after the transition Period. 163 HM Government, Clean Growth Strategy, October 2017, p. 45 164 Gov.uk, Meeting climate change requirements from 1 January 2021, 28 April 2020 [accessed 3 June 2020] 165 Gov.uk, Consultation outcome, The future of carbon pricing, 1 June 2020 166 Gov.uk consultation, The future of UK carbon pricing, 21 May 2019 167 EU, EU and Switzerland sign agreement to link emissions trading systems, 23 November 2017 162  45 Commons Library Briefing, 19 June 2020  ETS would require agreement between both parties and be subject to negotiation. Overall the process to link the Swiss ETS to the EU ETS took 10 years. 168 If the UK remained part of, or linked to, the EU ETS, the EU would continue to be responsible for developing and enforcing the rules. The Swiss Government will cede some regulatory control to Brussels as part of linking its ETS market to that of the EU ETS. Subject to the outcome of negotiations, the UK Government may therefore have limited ability to bring about any major reforms of the EU ETS. However, in March 2018 evidence to a House of Lords Committee, the then BEIS Minister noted that the UK has been part of the current negotiations for Phase 4 (up to 2030) and much of the final detail will happen during the period when the UK is still an active participant, thus giving some clarity up to 2030. 169 The 2019 consultation provided the following explanation on linking agreements: Any linking agreement requires a UK ETS to which the EU ETS could link. It is therefore necessary to develop a UK ETS in the first instance. When two ETSs are linked, each system recognises the allowances of the other. This has the effect of creating a single carbon price across both systems. Linking carbon markets can lead to more efficient emissions reduction, since allowances are tradable across a larger pool of participants. This results in a larger number of cost-effective abatement opportunities, as well as greater market liquidity for trading purposes, ensuring lower transactional costs and minimising the risk of market abuse. As well as increasing the efficiency of the system, a link between a UK ETS and the EU ETS would ensure a smooth transition for the relevant sectors. Given that a linking agreement would be subject to negotiation, it is not possible to outline the precise details of such an agreement at this stage. 170  The UK’s proposed scope of a UK ETS is that it matches the scope of the EU ETS both in respect of sectors and greenhouse gases covered. The consultation also sought views on the potential to expand scope in later years of UK ETS operation. The UK Government and the devolved Administrations also wrote to the Government’s independent advisers, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), on 2 May 2019 to request advice on a UK emissions trading scheme applying to the power, industry and aviation sectors, which would either be a standalone UK ETS or a UK ETS linked to the EU ETS. 171 In response, the CCC supported the Government’s preference for a linked UK-EU ETS, although it noted that carbon pricing alone will not provide sufficient decarbonisation and needs to be used as part of a suite of policy instruments. The Committee also recommended that the  Council of the EU press release, Linking of Switzerland to the EU emissions trading system - entry into force on 1 January 2020, 9 December 2019 [accesse 169 House of Lords Select Committee on the European Union, Oral evidence: Minister of State for Energy and Clean Growth, 21 March 2018, Q8 170 Gov.uk consultation, The future of UK carbon pricing, 21 May 2019, p. 16 171 Gov.uk, letter to CCC on UK ETS, 2 May 2019 168  46 Brexit: Energy and Climate Change  cap of the linked UK ETS be set based on the cost-effective path to the UK’s new net zero target. 172 The House of Lords EU Energy and Environment Sub-Committee concluded an inquiry on Post-Brexit carbon pricing which examined the options of a UK ETS linked to the EU ETS and a carbon emissions tax. It did not publish a report but wrote a number of letters to ministers on this topic. A UK ETS The UK Government and devolved Administrations published the response to the carbon pricing consultation on 1 June 2020. 173 It set out plans for a new UK emissions trading scheme to replace the EU ETS, which was designed by the UK Government jointly with the Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland Executive. Key elements of the UK ETS include: •  Phase I of the new UK ETS would run from 2021 to 2030  •  the UK ETS could operate as a linked or standalone system  •  the UK ETS will apply to energy intensive industries, power generators and aviation.  •  A proportion of allowances will be allocated for free; auctioning will continue to be the primary means of getting allowances. The auction reserve price will be £15 (nominal), with a mechanism in place to address any high price spikes or adjustments needed.  •  The cap will initially be set 5% below the UK’s notional share of the EU ETS cap for Phase IV of the EU ETS. This will be reviewed following the CCC’s advice on the sixth carbon budget and net zero later in 2020. The Government’s aim is that any changes needed as a result of this will be implemented by 2023 if possible and by no later than January 2024.  The UK Government will also publish a consultation in late 2020 on the design of a carbon emissions tax as an alternative to a UK ETS “to ensure a carbon price remains in place in all scenarios”. Negotiating positions The latest negotiating positions from each party in relation to carbon pricing are set out below. UK position  EU position  The UK draft energy agreement (published in May 2020) includes a placeholder on carbon pricing rather than proposed legal drafting. It states that the UK is open to linking any UK ETS with the EU ETS if it suited both sides’ interests but that it would need to recognise both  The EU draft treaty (March 2020) includes carbon pricing within the Level Playing Field Provisions: • The UK shall implement a system of carbon pricing of at least the same scope and effectiveness as that provided by the EU ETS.  172 173  CCC, letter to the Rt Hon Kwasi Kwarteng MP, BEIS, 7 August 2019 Gov.uk, Consultation outcome, The future of carbon pricing, 1 June 2020  47 Commons Library Briefing, 19 June 2020  parties as sovereign equals with their own domestic laws.  •  Should the UK create its own emissions trading system and request it to be linked to the EU ETS, the Union shall give serious consideration to such request, provided that it does not risk affecting the integrity of the EU ETS, in particular its balance of rights and obligations, and that an increase in scope and effectiveness is ensured.  Commentary The Committee on Climate Change wrote to the Government in March 2020 in response to a formal request from the UK Government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland Assembly regarding the future of carbon pricing in UK, specifically in relation to the successor to the EU Emissions Trading Systems (ETS) after EU exit. The Committee made a number of recommendations including that leaving the EU provides the UK with an opportunity to match the ambition of its own approach to an emissions trading scheme to the UK’s own circumstances, in particular its net zero target: Leaving the EU presents an opportunity for the UK to align the ambition of its trading scheme to the UK’s own circumstances. Ultimately, that requires a tightening of the cap of the scheme in line with a trajectory consistent with the UK’s Net Zero target for 2050. 174  The Committee went onto say that: We also note a change in language over linking to the EU ETS […] It is now described as an option at a later date, and if desired. The Committee remains of the view that a UK ETS should link to the EU ETS as soon as is practicable. 175  The industry trade body, Energy UK’s interim chief executive welcomed the Government’s approach: We strongly support Government establishing a UK ETS linked to the EU ETS and back its efforts to agree this approach with the EU. This is the best long-term carbon pricing mechanism to continue driving decarbonisation at the lowest cost to consumers, which will allow us to benefit from the liquidity of the world’s largest carbon market and help us meet our net zero target by 2050. In the event that a linking agreement cannot be secured in time for 1 January 2021, we welcome Government’s decision to introduce stability measures such as an Auction Reserve Price (ARP) to protect a newly-established stand-alone UK ETS from market shocks and volatility due to its smaller size. It is positive to have clarity on the level of the ARP (£15), however, we urgently need clarity from the Treasury of the level of the Carbon Emission CCC letter, The future of carbon pricing to The Rt Hon Kwasi Kwarteng MP, dated March 2020, published 1 June 2020 175 CCC letter, The future of carbon pricing to The Rt Hon Kwasi Kwarteng MP, published 1 June 2020 174  48 Brexit: Energy and Climate Change  Tax (CET) or at least the methodology in July. This will ensure that power operators have full visibility of the total carbon price, whether via a standalone UK ETS or CET fallback, in January 2021. 176  The E3G report on Climate change in the Brexit negotiations (May 2020) noted that although both the UK and EU seem to have significant alignment in their approach, linking trading systems can take years of negotiation: However, although many of the high-level objectives have significant alignment the pathway to achieving this is far from automatic. The experience of linking the Swiss emissions trading system to the EU-ETS required years of negotiation to work through all the detail. It is therefore vital that substantive negotiations on these issues begin as soon as possible. 177  176 177  Energy UK, Energy UK responds to UK Government's ETS proposal, 2 June 2020 E3G Briefing Paper, Climate change in the Brexit negotiations, Shane Tomlinson, May 2020 [accessed 16 June 2020]  49 Commons Library Briefing, 19 June 2020  6. Annex: Previous material on preparations for a possible “no deal” scenario (2017-January 2020) Before the UK left the EU on 31 January 2020, both parties put in place contingency plans in case of a “no deal” scenario where a withdrawal agreement was not agreed. Although no longer required, the following sections set out the plans that were made for this purpose for background information. This text therefore refers in part to issues resolved by the Withdrawal Agreement or subsequent policy developments.  6.1 Civil Nuclear As discussed in more detail above, the UK prepared for leaving Euratom, by passing the Nuclear Safeguards Act 2018 and negotiating replacement Nuclear Cooperation Agreements for trade. This preparation meant a no deal Brexit would not have had a disruptive impact on those aspects of the UK’s civil nuclear industry. For other functions of Euratom, such as supply arrangements, import licences, and nuclear research, a no deal Brexit may have affected the continuation of existing arrangements, and required management through proposed changes in funding or practice: •  Nuclear trade: Before the UK’s departure from the EU and Euratom, the Government published a number of guidance documents on trade of nuclear related materials after Brexit. Import licences for certain nuclear materials from EU countries, were not required before Brexit, but would have been required if there was no deal, and some supply contracts for nuclear material which involved a Euratom member may have needed to be reapproved. Shipping operators also needed to ensure they had applied for the correct authorisations and used the correct documentation when shipping radioactive waste and spent fuel. 178  •  Radioisotopes: In preparation for the possibility of the UK leaving the EU with no Brexit deal, the Government announced plans to stockpile medicines, but as radio-isotopes have short halflives, they cannot be stockpiled. Due to concerns of possible custom delays on road and rail routes, the May Government asked suppliers “to ensure they have plans in place to air freight [radioisotopes] to avoid any border delays that may arise”. 179  See also Gov.uk, Civil nuclear regulation if there’s no Brexit deal, guidance withdrawn on 12 August 2019 179 PQ 176162, [on Radioisotopes], 11 October 2018 178  50 Brexit: Energy and Climate Change  Some stakeholders questioned whether the air freight plans would be an efficient replacement for current arrangements. 180 In June 2019, the Department of Health and Social Care announced it would tender to secure an “express freight service” to provide “end-to-end” transport for medicines including radioisotopes in the case of no deal. 181 An article in the Pharmaceutical Journal quotes Layla McCay, director of international relations at the NHS confederation as saying the new express freight plans where [medicines are] tracked all the way” would be “more reliable”. 182 In a letter to Prime Minister Johnson on 1 August 2019, three groups who procure and use radioisotopes (the Royal College of Radiologists, the British Nuclear Medicine Society, and the UK Radiopharmacy Group) said they were “encouraged” by the work being undertaken on radioisotopes, but continued that they “remain[ed] apprehensive” about supplier readiness and the impact of supply changes on patients. They asked the Prime Minister for clarity on three issues: custom delays at airports, the need for qualified drivers, and what action would be taken to address the “increased costs caused by Brexit”. 183 •  Research: In the event of no-deal, the UK Government issued guidance (now withdrawn) on nuclear research after Brexit, which stated: The UK will leave Euratom (the European Atomic Energy Community) and will no longer be: •  a member of the Euratom Research & Training (R&T) programme  •  a member of Fusion for Energy  •  able to collaborate on the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project through the EU 184  In relation to a no deal scenario, the Government’s Nuclear research after Brexit guidance stated on ITER: The UK will no longer be a member of Fusion for Energy and UK businesses will not be able to bid for International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) contracts through Fusion for Energy. However, the UK government is exploring alternative options to maintain UK participation in ITER. 185  6.2 Energy trading and the IEM Before the UK’s departure from the EU, the Government published a number of technical notices on how to prepare for Brexit if there was  Caroline Wickware, Plans for importing medical isotopes changed after government review of no-deal Brexit proposals, The Pharmaceutical Journal, 13 August 2019 181 Department for Health and Social Care, New Service to deliver urgent medicines and medical products in the UK, 15 August 2019 182 Caroline Wickware, Plans for importing medical isotopes changed after government review of no-deal Brexit proposals, The Pharmaceutical Journal, 13 August 2019 183 Royal College of Radiologists, Prime Minister urged to clarify queries on radioisotope transport and costs, 1 August 2019 184 Gov.uk, Nuclear research after Brexit, 13 August 2019 185 Gov.uk, Nuclear research after Brexit, 13 August 2019 180  51 Commons Library Briefing, 19 June 2020  no deal (since withdrawn). 186 The guidance on trading gas and electricity stated the UK would leave the IEM in the event of no deal: European energy law will no longer apply to the UK and the UK’s electricity markets will be decoupled from the Internal Energy Market. 187  The gas guidance also stated the EU law would no longer apply. The implications for electricity trading were that new agreements would need to be developed: Cross-border flows across electricity interconnectors will no longer be governed by EU legislation which provides for efficient trade and cross-border cooperation in operating the electricity system. Without these arrangements, alternative trading arrangements will need to be developed. Regulators in the UK and EU will need to ensure that new access rules, which set the terms and conditions for this trade, are in place. 188  The guidance set out a number of actions that would need to be taken, such as market participants registering with EU regulators, changes to domestic industry codes and licences, and also stated that the Government had published statutory instruments, to come into effect on exit day in the event of no deal, to ensure energy laws continued to work. Similar requirements were laid out in the gas trading guidance.  6.3 The island of Ireland The SEM is based on a bilateral co-operation agreement between UK and Irish Governments, rather than on EU legislation. If the UK were to leave the IEM as a result of no deal, trading across the SEM was expected to be able to continue. However due to the fact the island of Ireland’s only physical connections with the IEM are through GB, trading between the SEM and IEM was expected to be uncoupled. Decoupling can lead to reduced efficiency as Box 1 explains, potentially leading to more expensive imports and higher energy bills for customers across the island of Ireland. The SEM committee, the decision-making committee for the market, published a technical note on 28 March 2019, explaining the differences in trading in the event of no-deal: This all-island trade will continue in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit. Trade between the all-island market and Great Britain, through the interconnectors, will continue although this trade may be less efficient, as some platforms operated under EU rules may not be used in the same way as today. In the SEM, generators and suppliers can trade electricity in a number of timeframes. Electricity can be traded the day before it is expected to be used (known as the Single Day Ahead Coupling - SDAC) and can be traded on the day itself (known as the Intraday Markets). Currently the SDAC operates as part of a panEuropean market, with the SEM connected through Great Britain. Electricity is traded across almost all the EU Member States Gov.uk, UK government’s preparations for a no deal scenario, last updated 23 August 2018 187 Gov.uk, Trading electricity if there’s no Brexit deal, updated 25 March 2019 188 Gov.uk, Trading electricity if there’s no Brexit deal, updated 25 March 2019 186  52 Brexit: Energy and Climate Change  simultaneously in this market. For the Intraday Market electricity is traded at a regional level between SEM and Great Britain. In the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, Great Britain will no longer be part of the pan-EU Day Ahead Market which will impact on the SEM’s ability to connect with the pan-EU market. In this situation, the SEM will continue to operate as an isolated, all-island market within the SDAC but with no connection between the SEM, GB and the wider EU market. 189  However the Government’s no deal guidance on Electricity Trading covered the issues for the SEM in the event of no deal, including the possibility that “the SEM cannot be maintained”: EU rules will cease to apply in Northern Ireland, leaving key elements of the Single Electricity Market without any legal basis. In the event of a no-deal, there will be implications for trade between Great Britain and the Single Electricity Market through interconnectors. […] Given the benefits to consumers and the economy of the more efficient, shared market, it is strongly in the interests of all parties to agree to a means to avoid the split of the market. Recognising this, the government will therefore take all possible measures to maintain the Single Electricity Market. The government will continue to work with the Irish Government and European Commission to seek agreement that the Single Electricity Market will continue. However, if such an agreement cannot be reached, there is a risk that the Single Electricity Market will be unable to continue, and the Northern Ireland market would become separated from that of Ireland. Separate Ireland and Northern Ireland markets will be less efficient, with potential effects for producers and consumers on both sides of the border. If this situation arises, government, the Northern Ireland Utility Regulator and SONI, the Northern Ireland Transmission System Operator, will take action to mitigate the risks in Northern Ireland. Contingency planning work is considering how best to transition to new arrangements if the Single Electricity Market cannot be maintained. 190  On 23 October 2018, during an evidence session for the House of Lords Energy and Environment Sub Committee, the then Minister Claire Perry MP and Jonathon Holyoak (Director for EU Energy and Climate Change at BEIS) were asked about no deal planning for Northern Ireland: Lord Rooker: Is your department responsible for making sure that, in Northern Ireland, portable generators are available in case things go wrong, or is it some other department? Are the generators being manufactured in the UK? Claire Perry: This is worst-case contingency planning. Jonathan Holyoak: In almost all the bad-case scenarios, the Utility Regulator in Northern Ireland will talk to the companies about ensuring that capacity is available. With us on the GB side, it will make sure that the interconnector between Scotland and  189 190  SEM Committee, Notice to Industry in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, 28 March 2019 Gov.uk, Trading electricity if there’s no Brexit deal, 25 March 2019  53 Commons Library Briefing, 19 June 2020  Northern Ireland works efficiently to secure Northern Irish supply as well. Claire Perry: To reassure you, there are conversations on that and other points, on an incredibly open-book basis, between my department and the Northern Ireland Office. It is a shame that we do not have a functioning Executive, but there are plenty of people on the ground who are very keen to help us not get to that scenario. 191  Both the Irish and UK Governments passed legislation in preparation for no deal. The Irish Government’s Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2019 was an omnibus Act which included provisions to protect electricity trading. The changes allow the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) to quickly modify (on a temporary basis) licences of Irish-based SEM participants in the event of no deal. The UK Government, under the powers of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, made several Statutory Instruments in order to ”remove inoperabilities” 192 relating to EU exit in relation to the SEM in a no deal scenario. However, the British Irish Chamber of Commerce and the trade body Energy UK, who held roundtables on the UK-Ireland energy relationship, warned that this legislation did not remove all risks for the SEM: It was agreed that this legislation, although welcome, should not be considered a panacea for the SEM in the event of a ‘No Deal’ Brexit. While the Irish Government does have some reserved competences in Energy policy, the majority of energy and climate legislation is derived from the EU under the auspices of the Internal Energy Market (IEM). 193  6.4 Other energy Guarantees of Origin Guarantees of Origin (GOOs) are certificates used to track and account for electricity generated by renewable energy sources or to identify the origin of generated electricity from combined heat and power (CHP). They are issued in Member States and recognised EU wide. 194 In the case of a no deal Brexit, UK guidance said the UK would continue to accept EU GOOs, but that UK GOOs would no longer be valid in the EU which may have impacted trading: In a ‘no deal’ scenario, the government will ensure that Great Britain will continue to recognise Guarantees of Origin issued in Northern Ireland and EU countries. This will allow electricity suppliers in Great Britain to continue to use EU and Northern House of Lords Select Committee on the European Union, Energy and Environment Sub-Committee, Uncorrected oral evidence: No deal preparations: energy and environment, 23 October 2018, Q37 192 Gov.uk, The Electricity and Gas etc. (Amendent etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019, 17 December 2018 193 British Irish Chamber of Commerce and Energy UK, Discussion Paper on ‘The impact of Brexit on the Single Electricity Market (SEM) and the Future of the Internal Energy Market (IEM) [accessed 5 September 2019] 194 The power to issue Guarantee of Origin certificates is devolved to Northern Ireland. 191  54 Brexit: Energy and Climate Change  Ireland Guarantees of Origin to comply with their fuel mix disclosure obligations and ensure that existing supply contracts are not compromised, in so far as these contracts depend upon Guarantee of Origin. […] Guarantees of Origin from combined heat and power [and for renewable energy] issued in Great Britain and Northern Ireland will no longer be recognised in the EU. This will mean that existing contracts with EU countries’ electricity suppliers or traders may be compromised if the contract terms require the transfer of a Guarantee of Origin recognised by the EU. 195  On 23 October 2018, during an evidence session for the House of Lords Energy and Environment sub-committee, the then Minister for Energy and Clean Growth Claire Perry said there was likely to be little impact on CHP generators, but did not mention renewable generators: To date, no UK-based CHP generators have applied for those EUissued CHP Guarantees of Origin, so we do not expect any electricity trade to be affected under a ’no deal’ scenario. 196  Energy efficiency Energy efficiency regulations limit the amount of energy that products consume which can reduce costs for consumers and reduce energyrelated emissions. Before the referendum, there were press reports that supported the case to leave the EU, as it would allow the UK to remove EU energy efficiency laws on household items such as hoovers and lightbulbs. 197 The Government’s domestic policy, before Brexit and at present, has been to keep costs down for consumers, and also to meet emissions targets (see sections below). The Government’s no deal guidance on ‘Meeting climate change requirements if there’s no Brexit deal’ stated that these regulations would continue to be met: For Ecodesign and energy labelling regulations which entered into force and applied before 29 March 2019, regulatory alignment was maintained by bringing relevant EU regulations into domestic law. Following the extension of Article 50 and the UK’s new departure date of 31 October, further legislation is being prepared to ensure any new EU laws that have come into force between 29 March and 31 October continue to function in the UK after Brexit. After the point of Brexit, the UK will keep step with equivalent standards wherever possible and appropriate, or even exceed them where it is in the UK’s interest to do so. 198  Gov.uk, Generating low-carbon electricity if there’s no Brexit deal, 24 September 2018 196 House of Lords Select Committee on the European Union, Energy and Environment Sub-Committee, Uncorrected oral evidence: No deal preparations: energy and environment, 23 October 2018, Q31 197 20 reasons you should vote to leave the European Union, The Telegraph, 22 June 2016 198 Gov.uk, Meeting climate change requirements if there’s no Brexit deal, 29 July 2019 195  55 Commons Library Briefing, 19 June 2020  6.5 Climate change In preparation for a possible no deal scenario at the time, the then Government published a technical notice on Meeting climate change requirements if there’s no Brexit deal on 12 October 2018 199 which focused on the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, the consolidated system of European Registries (of emissions units), and the geological storage of carbon dioxide. The European Commission also issued a number of Notices to Stakeholders on climate action, including on the “Withdrawal of the UK and the EU Emissions Trading System” and “Fluorinated gases” on 19 December 2018. The Library Briefing on EU Preparations for a no-deal Brexit (30 June 2019) provides further background.  Kyoto Protocol In a no deal scenario, the European Commission stated that accounts administered by the UK in the EU ETS Registry and the UK’s Kyoto Protocol National Registry would have been inaccessible. With regard to the Kyoto Protocol National Registry, the Government stated that its “preferred solution” was to retain access to the Consolidated System of European Registries but that this could not be guaranteed. The Government said that it was exploring options including retaining access to the existing Kyoto Protocol registry and the procurement of an alternative registry system with a view to establishing a new system by early 2021. It conceded that if access could not be retained in the event of a no deal scenario, there was “likely to be a gap in service”. 200  Carbon pricing: EU ETS and a carbon tax The Government’s guidance on meeting climate change requirements if there’s no Brexit deal (now archived) stated that it was “discussing with the Commission the implication of our exit from the EU on the EU ETS”. In relation to the EU ETS, the Government confirmed that it would remove requirements relating to the surrender of EUAs in a no deal scenario, but that it intended to maintain the monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) arrangements. 201 In evidence to the House of Lords EU Energy and Environment Sub-Committee, the then Energy Minister referred to this outcome as “a mirror system linked to the ETS”. 202 To accomplish this, the Government laid the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 on 25 January 2019 to maintain the MRV elements of the scheme in the UK, and to amend the other elements of retained EU law to reflect the fact that the UK would no longer be part of the EU ETS and to ensure that the 199  Gov.uk, Meeting climate change requirements if there’s no Brexit deal, 12 October 2018 [archived]  Gov.uk, Meeting climate change requirements if there’s no Brexit deal, updated 29 July 2019 [archived] 201 Gov.uk, Meeting climate change requirements if there’s no Brexit deal, 12 October 2018 [archived] 202 House of Lords Select Committee on the European Union, Energy and Environment Sub-Committee, Uncorrected oral evidence: No deal preparations: energy and environment, 23 October 2018, Q25 200  56 Brexit: Energy and Climate Change  retained law operated effectively in a domestic no deal scenario. Further Regulations were laid in April 2019 to update and amend the MRV elements to reflect changes in EU law. 203 Further information is available in the accompanying explanatory memorandum. A no deal scenario would have had practical consequences for the overall EU ETS market and both EU and UK participants as the UK would have left the EU ETS part way through a trading phase (Phase 3). Participants who were UK operators of installations would have no longer been part of the EU ETS and flights within the UK and between the UK and the EU would not have been covered by the scheme. There would have been no requirement for UK operators to surrender EU allowances to comply with the EU ETS. In the short term, these operators would have moved to a UK carbon tax regime, with the monitoring, reporting and verification elements of the EU ETS retained. In December 2018, the European Commission confirmed that as of exit day in a no deal scenario: No more auctions by the United Kingdom, no more allocation of free allowances to the accounts administered by the United Kingdom can take place and no exchanges of international credits can be performed by installation and aircraft operators administered by the UK. 204  As part of its contingency measures, the European Commission suspended these processes from 1 January 2019 until the day after ratification instruments concerning the Withdrawal Agreement were deposited. This suspension notification prevented the UK Government from issuing any 2019 allowances unless and until the suspension was lifted (i.e. until a deal was agreed and formally approved). In a no deal scenario, the suspension would have remained. Furthermore, the European Commission’s Notice to Stakeholders confirmed that the UK would no longer have been able to administer accounts in the EU ETS Union Registry. Prior to this, in contemplation of a then potential 29 March 2019 exit day, both the EU and the UK took action to ensure that 2018 UK allowances retained their value but did not completely flood the market should the UK have left with no deal at the end of March 2019 (see Box 5). In this case, as Article 50 was extended, these measures were not needed, and all 2018 UK allowances were valid for EU ETS compliance and indistinguishable from allowances issued by other EU member states. Box 5: 2018 EUAs – planning for a 29 March 2019 no deal Brexit As Article 50 was extended, these measures were not needed, and all 2018 UK allowances were valid for EU ETS compliance and indistinguishable from allowances issued by other EU member states. This information is included for background information only.  203  204  Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme (Amendment) (EU Exit) (No.2) Regulations 2019.  European Commission Notice to Stakeholders, Withdrawal of the UK and the EU ETS, 19 December 2018 [accessed 23 August 2019]  57 Commons Library Briefing, 19 June 2020  If the UK had left the EU ETS on exit day (then expected to be 29 March 2019), a key risk identified during 2017 was that UK participants could flood the market with a mass sell-off of EU Allowances which would result in a big crash in the price of carbon. In October 2017, the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA) was reported to explain that: A hard Brexit scenario poses a risk of approximately 220 million allowances issued by the United Kingdom to be offloaded onto the market between 1 January 2018 and 29 March 2019. 205 To safeguard against this, both the EU and the UK amended legislation 206 aiming to avoid a mismatch between the functioning of the EU ETS compliance timing (April 2019 for 2018 EUAs) and the timing of exit day (then March 2019). The purpose of the amendments was to ensure that 2018 UK allowances retained their value while also ensuring that they did not flood the market upon exit of the UK from the EU. The EU amended the EU ETS Registry Regulation to provide for marking and restricting the use of allowances issued by the UK from 1 January 2018 i.e. automatically voiding any such UK allowances and thus avoiding a flooding of the market. However, the amended Regulation provided that any EUAs for 2018 would not be voided in the following circumstances: • if EU law does not cease to apply in the UK by 30 April 2019; or • where it is sufficiently ensured that the surrender of allowances must take place by no later than 15 March 2019 in a legally enforceable manner. 207 The UK Government laid the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme (Amendment) Regulations 2017 in December 2017 to ensure UK-issued ETS allowances would keep their value. The regulations changed the EU ETS compliance deadline for 2018 emissions so that UK allowances will be validated and surrendered before 15 March 2019, and so (as per bullet point 2 above) UK-issued 2018 ETS allowances would keep their value and not be voided as a result of Brexit. The resulting situation is explained further by the European Commission as follows: The revised Regulation provides for marking and restricting the use of allowances issued by the United Kingdom as of 1 January 2018, unless Union law would not cease to apply in the United Kingdom by 30 April 2019 or it is sufficiently ensured that the surrender of allowances takes place in a legally enforceable manner by no later than 15 March 2019. Since the United Kingdom had informed the Committee of the adoption of a law on 27 December 2017 by which the compliance deadline for 2018 emissions has been advanced to 15 March 2019, allowances issued by the United Kingdom for the calendar year 2018 are however not marked and are accepted for surrender. 208  A UK-wide carbon tax The Government first published a technical notice on Meeting climate change requirements if there’s no Brexit deal on 12 October 2018, to set out arrangements for carbon pricing in the event that the UK had left the EU on 31 October 2019 without a deal. 209 The Government planned that, in a no deal scenario, the UK would have initially met its existing carbon pricing commitments via the tax system. 210 Following the extension of Article 50, the commencement Reuters, EU measures to safeguard carbon market from Brexit, Julia Fioretti, 18 October 2017 [accessed 9 August 2018] 206 The EU amended the EU ETS Registry Regulation; the UK amended the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme Regulations 2012 by passing the Greenhouse Gas 205  Emissions Trading Scheme (Amendment) Regulations 2017  European Commission, Commission Regulation amending Commission Regulation No 389/2013 of 2 May 2013, Article 1 208 European Commission press release: Update on safeguard measures for EU ETS (13 February 2018) 209 Gov.uk Carbon Emissions Tax technical note, 3 September 2019 [accessed 5 September 2019] 210 Gov.uk, Meeting climate change requirements if there’s no Brexit deal, 12 October 2018 [accessed 8 November 2018] 207  58 Brexit: Energy and Climate Change  date for the UK carbon emissions tax was amended from 15 April 2019 to 4 November 2019. 211 The tax would not have applied to the aviation sector. At Budget 2018, a UK-wide carbon emissions tax rate of £16/tCO2 was announced which would have applied to EU ETS sectors for emissions over and above an installation’s allowance (based on the EU ETS free allowance) in the event of such a no deal scenario: 3.51 Carbon pricing following EU exit – The government continues to plan for all scenarios as it prepares for EU exit. In the unlikely event no mutually satisfactory agreement can be reached and the UK departs from the EU ETS in 2019, the government would introduce a Carbon Emissions Tax to help meet the UK’s legally binding carbon reduction commitments under the Climate Change Act. The tax would apply to all stationary installations currently participating in the EU ETS from 1 April 2019. A rate of £16 would apply to each tonne of carbon dioxide emitted over and above an installation’s emissions allowance, which would be based on the installation’s free allowances under the EU ETS. The government is also legislating so it can prepare for a range of long-term carbon pricing options. 212  This rate was broadly in line with the EU ETS pricing at that time, although the EUA price rose to over EUR 28 in July 2019. 213 The rate for 2019 was reconfirmed at £16 per tonne by the Government in September 2019. 214 Further information on this proposal is available in the Government policy paper on the Carbon Emissions Tax which was published alongside Budget 2018. The Finance Act 2019 (Part 3) contains provisions to implement the carbon emissions tax, to be brought into force in the event of a no deal scenario only. Following the extension of Article 50, these provisions were not brought into force and the carbon emissions tax was not commenced.

Climate justice 1.1 Overview Climate justice is a movement which sees climate change and its solutions as an issue which should focus on human rights, development and equity. It also has a strong focus on the historical responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions. The Mary Robinson Foundation explains climate justice as follows: Climate justice links human rights and development to achieve a human-centred approach, safeguarding the rights of the most vulnerable people and sharing the burdens and benefits of climate change and its impacts equitably and fairly. Climate justice is informed by science, responds to science and acknowledges the need for equitable stewardship of the world’s resources. 1  In September 2013 the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) published a briefing Climate justice and international development: policy and programming which summarised the term as follows: Climate justice recognises the development paradox that those who contributed least to greenhouse gas emissions will be most affected by climate change. Governments need a sound and workable theory of climate justice that draws on the political theory of justice, on antecedents in environmental and social justice, and on how climate justice links to ideas of developmental justice. Environmental justice has three components: equitably distributed environmental risk; recognition for people’s diverse needs and experiences; and participation in the political processes that create and manage environmental policy. 2  There are a number of international organisations and groups campaigning on climate justice. For example, Friends of the Earth Europe campaigns for climate justice and Greenpeace International campaigns for climate justice. Each of these organisations may have a slightly different interpretation or definition of what “climate justice” means. Within the UK, a climate justice fund was launched by the Scottish Government in 2012 and ran until 2017. More recently, there has been discussion on ensuring a “just transition” to a low carbon / net zero future and the Welsh Government has set up a “Climate Just Advisory Group” to focus on this issue; 3 while the UK Government has announced that HM Treasury will lead a review into the costs of decarbonisation to look how such costs are distributed in the longer  1 2  3  Mary Robinson Foundation, Principles of Climate Justice [accessed 3 February 2020] IIED Briefing, Climate justice and international development: policy and programming, September 2013 Welsh Government, Written Statement: Committee on Climate Change advice on long-term emissions target, 2 May 2019  Climate justice 3  term. More information on this is available in the Library Briefing Paper on Net Zero in the UK (16 December 2019).  1.2 Brief history In 2000, the first Climate Justice Summit took place in the Hague at the same time as the Sixth UNFCCC Conference of the Parties (COP6) in the Netherlands. 4 Following this, the Bali Principles of Climate Justice were launched at the Earth Summit in Bali in June 2002, and endorsed by a range of environmental, development and indigenous organisations. The Principles included the recognition of the “ecological debt” of developed countries for their greenhouse gas emission; holding fossil fuel companies liable for greenhouse gas and local pollutants; the right of all to access to affordable and sustainable energy and a call for affected communities play a leading role in national and international processes to address climate change. 5 In 2004 the Durban Group for Climate Justice was formed and in 2007 the global coalition Climate Justice Now! was founded. In 2010, the Mary Robinson Foundation - Climate Justice was set up with the vision that “by 2020 global justice and equity will underpin a people-centred, developmental approach to advancing climate justice and more effectively addressing the impacts of climate change”. 6 In 2012, the Scottish Government launched a Climate Justice Fund in which it defined the climate justice as follows: Climate justice is a people-centered, human rights approach, which shares the benefits of equitable global development and the burdens of climate change fairly, and builds trust between developed and developing countries  More information on the fund, its achievements and funding allocations is available on the Scottish Government webpage on the Climate Justice Fund. The Joseph Roundtree Foundation (JRF) brief on Climate Justice: The science and the evidence published in 2014 also provides further background and history, and discusses the evidence base supporting the concept. It concluded that this was an issue that needed to focus equally on current and future generations: Climate justice is not only a question of ensuring that nobody is unfairly impacted by climate change now: it also requires recognition that future generations have rights too. This is a concept that remains unacknowledged in prevailing legal systems and demands a comprehensive rethinking of the balance between risks, rights and responsibilities. Mandy Meikle, a researcher with the Centre for Climate Justice, pointed out that assessing the detrimental effects of climate change on vulnerable groups involves making projections about the future. For this reason, such effects are not considered 4  5 6  Guardian, The first climate justice summit: a pie in the face for the global north, 16 April 2014 [accessed 18 July 2019] Bali Principles of Justice, 29 August 2002 Mary Robinson Foundation, Mission and vision [accessed 18 July 2019]  4  Number CDP 2020/0020, 3 February 2020  violations of human rights within current legal systems: the people whose rights are infringed might not yet have been born. This prompted one participant to suggest there should be an ‘ombudsman for future generations’ to act as an advocate for those most at risk from environmental crisis.  For a more detailed review the JRF published a Climate Change and Social Justice: An Evidence Review in February 2014. In December 2018, the People’s Demands for Climate Justice (signed by 292,000 individuals and 366 organisations) called upon government delegates at COP24 in Poland comply with a list of six climate justice demands: •  Keep fossil fuels in the ground.  •  Reject false solutions that are displacing real, people-first solutions to the climate crisis.  •  Advance real solutions that are just, feasible, and essential.  •  Honour climate finance obligations to developing countries.  •  End corporate interference in and capture of the climate talks.  •  Ensure developed countries honour their “Fair Shares” for largely fuelling this crisis.  A World Forum on Climate Justice was held in Glasgow in June 2019 (organised by Elsevier in partnership with the Glasgow Caledonian University Centre for Climate Justice), including an address from Rt Hon Nicola Sturgeon MSP.  1.3 Use in UK Government / Parliament Sustainable Development Goals The Sustainable Development Goals were approved at the UN in September 2015 and include 17 goals to be achieved by 2030. Goal 13 relates to climate action: to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts although does not specifically reference “climate justice”. The UK’s national review of the sustainable development goals, which is a report on the implementation on the SDGs by the UK so far, provides the following information on action taken across the UK in relation to the topic of climate justice: •  The very poorest are likely to be hit hardest and first by the impacts of climate change. The UK’s International Climate Finance (ICF) directs resources to both adaptation and mitigation to reduce vulnerability to shocks while reducing global emissions. Under the International Development Act (Gender Equality) 2014 the UK will prioritise the needs of women and girls in its development spending.  •  The Scottish Government’s Climate Challenge Fund has provided 1,097 grants totalling more than £101 million to 658 communities to support their move to low carbon living. The projects themselves cover activities that help deliver Goal 13 such as increasing the energy efficiency of community buildings, food growing, cutting waste, and the expansion of active and sustainable transport options.  Climate justice 5  Projects aim to improve the climate literacy of their communities and must have a measurable carbon emissions reduction. •  The Welsh Government will establish a climate justice advisory group to explore how the transition away from a fossil fuel-based economy to a low carbon future could impact on Welsh industries and the communities, to collectively develop measures to decarbonise to a low carbon economy that is fair and maximises well-being opportunities for all. 7  Further information on the Sustainable Development Goals is available in the Library Insight: SDGs: how is the UK performing? and the Library briefing paper: UK Voluntary National Review on the SDGs (6 June 2019).  Select Committees The International Development Committee published a report on UK aid for combating climate change (May 2019) which included a section on Climate Compatible Development and Climate Justice. The Report quoted the then Energy Minister (Claire Perry) responding to the question of whether the UK Government had considered adopting a “climate justice” approach: The language that governs us more is “leave no one behind”, because there are issues of transition in developed countries too; you have tens of thousands of coalminers in Poland who are worried about what they will do as the country moves away from coal. 8  The Committee went on to conclude and recommend: In terms of developing policies and designing programmes, the concepts of climate compatible development and climate justice provide helpful guidelines for ensuring that climate finance brings maximum benefits for addressing both the causes and impacts of climate change whilst promoting sustainable development. The  Government should explicitly adopt these approaches and be guided by them in policy development and programme design. 9  The Government response was published on 1 August 2019 and “partially agreed” with the Committee’s recommendation as follows: Government response: Partially agree The UK aid supports sustainable development that is compatible with tackling the causes and impacts of climate change. The Prime Minister committed at the G20 to aligning all UK ODA with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. Trying to disentangle and address the precise contribution various factors make to poverty and the challenges faced by the poor however—as sometimes implied by those who argue for the concept of climate justice—is difficult, and the point is to provide effective help. Effective sustainable development is best done in partnership with governments and communities, producing strong 7  8 9  HM Government, Voluntary National Review of progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals, June 2019 Para 67 Para 69  6  Number CDP 2020/0020, 3 February 2020  development strategies that take account of all factors and risks, including climate change. This is why we prefer to frame this as a commitment to leave no one behind, in line with the UN led 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. When disasters strike, the UK has demonstrated that we are ready to help. The UK is the world’s second largest humanitarian donor, doubling funding for humanitarian assistance from £484 million in 2009 to £1.1 billion in 2014, rising to £1.4 billion in 2017. Finding ways to cut the impact and costs of disasters is a major stream of work in DFID including in the run-up to the UN Climate Action Summit in September. We are pleased to be co-leading work on building resilience, recognising how important that is, especially for the poorest communities most vulnerable to the impact of climate change. Where appropriate ICF programmes also seek to incorporate nature based solutions For example, programmes which protect mangrove systems or promote sustainable forestry can not only increase the resilience of local populations to extreme weather events, but also preserve and enhance biodiversity and provide stable, environmentally sustainable jobs for the future. 10  10  International Development Committee, Twelfth Special Report, UK aid for combating climate change: Government Response to the Committee’s Eleventh Report, 1 August 2019  Climate justice 7  2.

Press releases Climate Action Network International ´Immediately shift investments from fossil fuels into renewables and nature protection and restoration,´ civil society said to the World Economic Forum (WEF) participants. January 23, 2020  Immediately shift investments from fossil fuels into renewables and nature protection and restoration, civil society said to government, bank and business leaders convening in Davos for the World Economic Forum (WEF). For the first time, the latest edition of the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Global Risk Report identifies failure to mitigate and adapt to climate change as the greatest risk the world faces in the short and long term (10 years). It took the destruction of forests, farmland, animals and peoples’ livelihoods in Australia and the Amazon and a devastating year of extreme weather events including typhoons and cyclones that killed thousands and ravaged Africa and Southeast Asia for the Forum´s network of business leaders, academics and NGOs to join the chorus in sounding the alarm on the climate emergency. Yet, key speakers at the meeting came across completely out of tune with the WEF´s main topic this year: ‘Climate change and building a cohesive, inclusive and sustainable economy’. Although the USA is the second largest global emitter of greenhouse gases, President Donald Trump delivered a re-election speech instead of focusing on what his government will do to tackle climate change, the world´s greatest threat. Additionally, Greenpeace International highlighted in a new report that 24 banks, regularly represented at Davos, have provided US$1.4 trillion to the fossil fuel industry since the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015 through to the end of 2018. The report also looks at how pension funds and insurance companies, whose CEOs go to Davos, have been propping up fossil fuels. In response to President Trump’s speech, Greenpeace International Executive Director Jennifer Morgan said, “It seems to escape the President that no money can be made on a dead planet - there can be no jobs, no economic growth.” Against this backdrop, 2019 marked a series of summits that exposed the brazen lack of political will by large emitters to listen to the rising calls from scientists and people to act on the global emergency. These include the UN Secretary General’s Climate Action Summit in New York and the UN Conference (COP25) in Madrid.  10 Number CDP 2020/0020, 3 February 2020  Despite the highest ever carbon pollution by fossil fuels in 2018 and 2019 and three scientific reports in the last two years, delivered by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), highlighting the best and newest science on potentially devastating impacts on nature and people, governments of rich nations try to muddle through. Added to that, millions of people, particularly youth flooded the streets of many cities, demanding climate and social justice to transform the present system. Yet highly polluting and rich governments still failed to deliver commitments to raise climate ambition and action to limit dangerous climate impacts. While in 2018 the IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C stipulated that limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial would require rapid, farreaching and unprecedented changes in all spheres of society, the UN Production Gap report released in December 2019 showed that governments are not committing to what they signed up for in Paris in 2015. They are, in fact, planning to produce about 50% more fossil fuels by 2030 than would be consistent with limiting global warming to 2°C levels and 120% more than would be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. The report makes clear that participants in Davos hold direct responsibility in tackling the climate crisis as it says that the “continued expansion of fossil fuel production is underpinned by ambitious national plans, government subsidies and other forms of public finance.” Ironically, in the days leading to this year’s WEF where VIPs, royalty and others flocked in private jets to celebrate the Forum´s 50th anniversary and discuss climate change in Davos, Oxfam released its “Time to Care” report. The report makes clear that global wealth is increasingly founded on inequality. It concludes that just over 2,000 individual billionaires control more money than 60 percent of the world’s poorest population. This wealth is generated through the unpaid labor of the poorest women who are also on the front line of climate impacts in vulnerable countries. In light of all this, civil society, supported by Greta Thunberg and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, demands that the world´s most influential business and political leaders convening in Davos immediately halt investments in fossil fuel exploration and extraction, end fossil fuel subsidies and completely divest investment in fossil fuels. Representatives of banks, companies, governments and other institutions currently participating in the WEF must respond to the emergency they acknowledge and build a cohesive and sustainable economy by investing in the energy transition and supporting the sustainable management of nature to achieve resilience. The wealth owned by only just over 2,000 people is equivalent to 30 times the global annual investments into renewables. This shows how easy it would be to triple investments in renewables annually and start responding to the emergency. Climate Action Network (CAN) Executive Director Tasneem Essop said:  Climate justice 11  In what is a first, the WEF Global Risk Report this year identifies climate change as the greatest global risk. This is encouraging, but we would need to see real and meaningful actions to address this risk. This would require the powerful elite; political leaders, CEO’s and other decision makers who gather in Davos, to take actions in line with the science, to heed the UN Production Gap Report, listen to the call of the people and immediately stop all investments in fossil fuel exploration and production. The WEF needs to take a stand and end the social license of the fossil fuel industry or risk losing credibility.  Members of Climate Action Network (CAN) said: May Boeve, Executive Director, 350.org: Those most responsible for the climate crisis in the first place were gathered at the World Economic Forum. Because of the power and the money represented at Davos this week, we’ve seen increasingly devastating climate impacts every year. These same wealthy people have stood as a wall separating governments and any real climate action. The climate movement is breaching that wall. It is because of the power of millions of people who took to the streets that these few billionaires are now feeling the urgency of tackling climate breakdown. As we enter the new decade, we need the world to know that the fossil fuel era is over. The financiers and industry leaders would be wise to see the writing on the wall and get out of this toxic industry in their own selfinterest, if not in the interest of the planet as a whole.  Gavan McFadzean, Climate Change and Clean Energy Manager, Australian Conservation Foundation: Australia is the third largest exporter of fossil fuel emissions, behind only Russia and Saudi Arabia. The emissions from these fuels are turbo-charging climate change, which has contributed to our unprecedented bushfire season. If we don’t urgently stop digging up and burning coal, oil and gas, future bushfire seasons will be even worse than this year’s devastating Australian summer.  Sven Harmeling, Global Policy Lead on Climate Change and Resilience, CARE International: The climate crisis is a harsh daily reality for hundreds of millions of people, particularly women and girls, a fact which the leaders gathered in Davos must put at the center of their actions. The increasing risk of failure to prevent a complete climate breakdown is a direct threat to us all, but particularly the poorest and most vulnerable. 2020 must become the year where true and meaningful action on emission cuts and climate adaptation substitute lukewarm rhetoric and empty promises.  Dr Kat Kramer, Global Lead - Climate Change, Christian Aid: WEF participants represent those businesses and interests that have brought the world to its knees. Both the climate and biosphere are in a state of crisis and we have failed to tackle poverty. These powerful participants have the choice to break the world through continuing with business-as-usual malevolent practices. Alternatively, they can help to make a new future, one that respects planetary limits and the rights of all to thrive. This visionary future will require a rapid phase out of all fossil fuels – gas included – electrification of the global economy through clean renewable technologies and access to energy for all. It will require the rich to consume less. It will require the conservation of  12 Number CDP 2020/0020, 3 February 2020  remaining wild places, and restoration of ecosystems that have been destroyed or degraded in rapacious search of profits. The fate of the planet and its people is in the hands of WEF participants. Will they choose to destroy or to create hope?  Jennifer Morgan, Executive Director, Greenpeace International: The banks, insurers and pension funds here at Davos are culpable for the climate emergency. These money men say they support the Paris Agreement, but since its signing they have been actively undermining the accord by propping up the fossil fuel industry to the tune of US$1.4 trillion dollars. The finance sector is leading us into another financial crash in the midst of this climate emergency. The regulators must do their jobs before it is too late and financial actors have to start acting now on the scientific and economic warnings.  Harjeet Singh, Global Lead on Climate Change, ActionAid: Global elites in Davos are trying to disguise their lack of real climate action to reduce emissions and shift away from fossil fuels. They are trumpeting weak and false solutions such as tree planting initiatives and technologies that don’t yet exist. Meanwhile, across our dangerously warming planet, people are already experiencing the agonising effects of the climate emergency. Bushfires continue to rage in Australia, while 45 million people in Southern Africa are facing severe food insecurity brought on by the worst drought the region has seen in 35 years. It’s time for the rich countries and polluting industries that have caused climate change to meet their obligations to those least responsible, but who are suffering the most. We need transformational system change and finance to tackle the crisis, not business as usual and greenwashing.  Sriram Madhusoodanan, Deputy Campaigns Director, Corporate Accountability: Impacts of the climate crisis are endured daily by people on the global frontlines -- young people, communities of color, people in the Global South, women, and indigenous people. The global movement to demand climate justice is growing and inescapable — and the latest report from the World Economic Forum in Davos further forces the recognition of the grave societal impacts of the climate crisis. But, the cheap words and greenwashing ploys that some of the world’s dirtiest corporations have issued are unacceptable. It is high time that the those most responsible for the global climate crisis be held accountable for the devastations they are knowingly driving, and high time for finance that addresses climate impacts and paves the way for real solutions. People around the world are demanding it. And we are resolved to make it a reality.  Ronan Palmer, Director, Clean Economy, E3G: It’s hard to believe how tone deaf and out-of-tune Davos has been this year. It should have been a gathering of leaders to actually lead change and development, cohesion and sustainability. It turns out to be lots of words, that are just not up the scale of the real horror that has unfolded in Australia, or the creeping destruction of habitats and of livelihoods caused by Climate Change. In a year where there was at last a real political space opened up by crowds of people, of voters, of consumers on  Climate justice 13  the streets looking for change, we just got more words. In the year we really need to act to save our economies and standards of living, we got no action. Davos should be better than this. The fact that it isn’t is a serious indictment of world business leaders.  Sue Willsher, Senior Policy Advisor for Climate Change at Tearfund, said: The fact that climate change has been highlighted as a key risk facing the world today at Davos is hugely encouraging. But the sheer lack of inaction, disguised in 'green policies' by the businesses, leaders and governments represented there, is astonishing. If we are to have any chance of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees (in line with the Paris Agreement) we need sharp and urgent cuts in emissions from governments and businesses in 2020. This includes an end to investments in fossil fuels and a switch to renewable energy. Young people hitting the streets in their hundreds of thousands have shown us they want action on climate change and are willing to make changes in their own lifestyles, but as individuals we can only do so much. How will history judge all of us on what we have done to combat climate change?  Friends of the Earth International COP 25: Resurgence of carbon markets threatens people, politics and planet 2 December 2019, Madrid, Spain  As the international climate talks open today in Madrid, Spain, the world faces the re-emergence of a threat that could derail urgent action on the climate crisis: Carbon Markets are back on the table as a proposed ‘solution’ to reduce emissions. Dipti Bhatnagar, Climate Justice and Energy Programme Coordinator for Friends of the Earth International, from Mozambique, said: Big polluters must be rubbing their hands in glee that carbon market mechanisms, which further dilute the already weak and inadequate Paris emissions targets, are back on the agenda. We will fight them tooth and nail. The climate crisis is already devastating lives. Emissions are still rising. Now is not the time to offer an escape route to polluting Northern country governments and big oil.  Tackling the climate crisis requires a total, radical and immediate shift away from fossil fuels and a huge flow of finance from the global North to the global South. This is needed to repay the ecological debt, for a just transition and for loss and damage. We need an economic and political system which serves the needs of people, not profit - nothing less than radical system change. Bhatnagar continued: Carbon markets fail to deliver emissions reductions or adequate climate action and impact horrifically on Indigenous Peoples and  14 Number CDP 2020/0020, 3 February 2020  local communities. They only serve to strengthen corporate power and impunity, deflect responsibility from rich historical polluters and prevent urgent and equitable action on climate change.  With an abrupt change of location a month ago, COP25 becomes the third of four consecutive UN climate conferences to be held in Europe. As a result, Southern participation continues to be undermined. Northern governments and corporations will be hoping for less scrutiny from communities in the South so they can try and push through dangerous false solutions. Friends of the Earth International and our allies in the climate justice movement will be watching. Meanwhile, the world’s attention will likely focus on European concerns and not on the repression experienced in Chile and across Latin America. While talks are underway in Madrid, civil society movements are meeting in Chile to march against neoliberal policies and climate injustice - their concerns must not be forgotten. Karin Nansen, Chair of Friends of the Earth International, from Uruguay, commented: We stand in solidarity with the people of Chile in their struggle against neoliberalism, inequality and violent repression. This COP must not allow President Piñera’s government to build a positive reputation abroad while oppressing his people at home. Chile should not be the COP Presidency.  COP25 talks come hard on the heels of massive global mobilisations on 29 November. Greater numbers are expected on 6 December in Madrid as well as Chile. Blanca Ruibal from Friends of the Earth Spain said: Peoples are rising up across the world, from Spain to Chile and beyond. We say to governments and political decision makers: ignore this wave of people power at your peril. The future of our planet is at stake. We will continue fighting for it and stand with the peoples who are most affected.  UN Sustainable Development Goals New report offers details on how to maximize efforts to achieve both climate action and the Sustainable Development Goals 12 November 2019 With the global challenge of climate action threatening progress made on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a new report from the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) offers ways to better serve both the world’s efforts to achieve the goals of the Paris Climate Change Agreement and the SDGs to ensure better lives for all people. The new analysis, entitled “Maximizing Co-benefits by Linking Implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and Climate Action,” is an extended summary report of the first Climate and SDGs Synergy Conference—formally the “Global Conference on  Climate justice 15  Strengthening Synergies between the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”—held from 1-3 April at UN City in Copenhagen. The new summary report expands on the key immediate action areas identified by Conference participants and aims to promote coordinated implementation of the objectives of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs, across all levels and sectors. According to the report, the cooperative implementation needs a multilevel, bottom-up integration of climate action and the SDGs, aligned with human rights. This would tackle the climate emergency and ensure that the world’s most vulnerable groups—women, persons with disabilities, older persons, youth, refugees and migrants are not left behind. Progress towards low-carbon, climate-resilient societies and economies is already happening, as seen in the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) of the Paris Agreement and the Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) of the SDGs put forth by countries. Also promising is that there is growing awareness of climate change among governments and other stakeholders, and adaption and mitigation mechanisms are more deeply embedded in governmental structures. On the other hand, there are still gaps in many developing countries and progress remains slow. The development of low-emission economies requires deep structural changes to global energy, transport, water and food production systems in order to eradicate extreme poverty and achieve sustainable economic growth. Achieving these will be even more difficult with the effects of climate change that we are already seeing, including more severe temperature variations, sea level rise, floods and droughts. These hazards make the world’s water, agriculture, health and forestry sectors more vulnerable. Furthermore, implementing specific SDGs would be directly beneficial in achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. Particularly, speeding up the energy transition (SDG 7) and more sustainably managing forests and other terrestrial ecosystems (SDG 15) would directly and positively affect greenhouse gas emissions. Similarly, sustainable industrialization (SDG 9), sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural practices (SDG 2) and responsible consumption and production (SDG 12) contribute to low emission pathways and sustainable development. In addition, limiting global temperature increase to well below 1.5 degrees Celsius would be beneficial to the SDGs related to resilience and disaster risk reduction, such as poverty (SDG 1), infrastructure (SDG 9) and urban settlement (SDG 11). Climate change is already causing extreme weather conditions, leading to human and socioeconomic costs and reversing development gains. Therefore, the actions indicated in NDCs and NAPs, as well as the targets of SDG 13 on climate action, should be integrated into policies, programmes and budgets across all sectors.  16 Number CDP 2020/0020, 3 February 2020  Read the full report online here: https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/climate-sdgs-synergies2019 House of Commons International Development Committee 16 July 2019 The International Development Committee (IDC) identifies serious failings in the preparation and presentation of UK’s first Voluntary National Review of progress towards the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.  Government’s Voluntary National Review casts doubt on its commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals •  Read the Report Summary [HTML]  •  Read the Report's Recommendations and Conclusions [HTML]  •  Read the Report [HTML]  •  Government response: UK's progress on the Sustainable Development Goals: The Voluntary National Review  Report findings •  The UK has taken a long time to get around to producing a VNR (some countries have produced two since 2015) and so expectations were naturally that much higher, and the disappointment that much greater.  •  The Government had 19 months between committing to a VNR and producing it. Despite this, the timeline was squeezed and most of the work – and virtually all of the engagement activity – was left to the last few months, preventing stakeholders from meaningfully engaging in, or influencing, the final report.  •  The engagement activity recommended by the UN – consultation with stakeholders like human rights institutions; trades unions; business and industry; NGOs; parliamentarians and UK academia – was not only late but also ‘ad hoc’ and superficial.  •  The VNR itself was selective and partial, relying on cherry-picked data, context-free snapshots and positive vignettes, to present a ‘good story’. It skirted discussion of some serious issues, for instance: food security, poverty trends and EU withdrawal. The Secretary of State for International Development told the Committee there was “nervousness” around the Government “marking [its] own homework”.  •  The implications of these failings of process and substance in the VNR is that the UK is not taking the SDG initiative seriously – as integral to, and coherent with, the Government’s overall agenda. This is also evident in making DFID the lead coordinating department, as opposed the Cabinet Office, whose role is “supporting collective government, helping to ensure the  Climate justice 17  effective development, coordination and implementation of policy”. The IDC will return to this matter later in the year. In consequence, today’s IDC report calls for: •  Steps to implement the UK’s commitment to the SDG agenda (such as: a convincing statement at today’s UN High Level Political Forum; giving overall responsibility for SDGs to the Cabinet Office; building the Goals into cross-government planning, spending review and reporting processes), and  •  A commitment at the HLPF to: producing a further Review in three years’ time, with a more collaborative, consultative and comprehensive VNR process; and delivery of a more rigorous, data-driven, contextualised evaluation of the UK’s performance against the SDG targets next time.  Chair's comments Stephen Twigg MP, Chair of the Committee, said: Today, the UK will present its first Voluntary National Review to the UN. This should have provided a clear indication of how far the UK has progressed towards meeting the Sustainable Development Goals, a global agenda which includes the most crucial challenges facing the world today, across the full spectrum of social, economic, political and environmental issues. However, we have found both the preparation and the presentation of the VNR to be gravely flawed. We fear that the priority and resources committed to the VNR process – and the whole SDGs agenda – reflect a lack of engagement and understanding at the heart of, and throughout, the UK Government. We do welcome the progress the UK is shown to have made, and signs of some efforts made to incorporate sustainable development across government departments. But this progress has been uneven, and knowledge of the Sustainable Development Goals across Government remains limited. Our sincere hope is that the Government has learned important lessons from this first VNR process and that, at today’s presentation at the HLPF, will kickstart a fresh commitment to the SDGs.

Asked by: Deidre Brock (Edinburgh North and Leith) (SNP) What recent meetings he had with his international counterparts on climate justice at the UN General Assembly. Answered by: The Minister of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Zac Goldsmith) Climate change and biodiversity were top priorities for the Government at the recent UN General Assembly. The UK played a leading role, with the Prime Minister announcing a doubling of our international climate finance to £11.6 billion and a major focus on backing nature-based solutions to climate change. Angela Crawley The International Development Committee has specifically recommended that the UK Government should adopt the concept of climate justice to guide their climate spending, but this Government seem scared to even utter the words: not a single International Development Minister has ever said the words “climate justice” in this Chamber. Why are this Government so intent on ignoring this recommendation? Zac Goldsmith Given what we know about the science in relation to climate change and what we know about what is happening to biodiversity, habitat and species loss, it is absolutely right that this Government’s focus should be on tackling and preventing climate change, both through technology and by doing everything we can to protect and restore the natural world. If we do not do that, no amount of money from this or any other aid Department will properly compensate poorer countries for the devastation that will follow. Deidre Brock I am afraid that the Minister failed entirely to answer my hon. Friend’s question. Will he tell the House when he will follow Scotland’s lead and the recommendation of the International Development Committee and explicitly adopt the concept of climate justice to help to guide climate mitigation spending? Zac Goldsmith I thank the hon. Lady for her question, but I do not agree that I did not answer the previous one. We provide £5.8 billion for climate finance at  20 Number CDP 2020/0020, 3 February 2020  the moment, and that will double to at least £11.6 billion. The whole basis of that programme is, in a sense, climate justice. It is about helping developing countries to prepare for climate change, to adapt to the inevitable changes and to fight the causes of climate change to minimise the impact. Mrs Pauline Latham (Mid Derbyshire) (Con) By 2030, the destruction of the world’s important habitats and the threat of climate change could force more than 100 million people into poverty. Does my hon. Friend agree that urgent action is needed to tackle deforestation throughout the world? I commend my hon. Friend for all her work on this issue. She is absolutely right, and that is why, when the Prime Minister spoke at the UN, he emphasised the importance of investing in nature as a means of tackling climate change. She mentions forests, and they are an obvious example. About 1 billion people depend on forests for their survival, and protecting and restoring forests alleviates poverty, tackles climate change and helps to reverse the biodiversity loss that we have seen over recent years. James Gray (North Wiltshire) (Con) First, may I welcome my hon. Friend to his well-deserved place at the Dispatch Box? The environmental world rejoices that he is there, and I know he will do an outstandingly good job. Does he agree that it is a perfectly legitimate use of aid funds to spend money on climate change reduction and climate change battling as well as on the mitigation of the worst effects of climate change? That helps in a global sense, and it also helps to mitigate the worst effects for the poorest people in the world. Zac Goldsmith I thank my hon. Friend for his kind words. He is exactly right to say that we will have no hope at all of tackling poverty globally if we do not take a bigger interest in preventing climate change and the annihilation of the natural world that we have seen in recent decades. The people on the frontline in relation to nature destruction are the world’s poorest people. They are the people who depend most directly on the natural world, so he is absolutely right. Kerry McCarthy (Bristol East) (Lab) I welcome the Minister to his post. I am sure he will agree that the food and farming system has a major impact on climate change in developing countries, from deforestation to water use and mountains of food waste, but that is not really talked about in DFID terms except for some small livestock programmes. Can he assure me that it will be at the top of his agenda as a Minister in this Department? [912510] Zac Goldsmith As we heard from the Secretary of State in his first answer, we have committed serious sums of money to enabling smallholders around the world to adapt to climate change. We have also launched an initiative at  Climate justice 21  the UN called the Just Rural Transition, which is about shifting the way subsidies are spent around the world on land use, away from unsustainable use towards sustainable use, just as we are doing in this country. The OECD tells us that the 50 top food-producing nations spend £700 billion a year subsidising land use, on the whole very badly. If we can shift even a fraction of that, it will have a much bigger impact than all the world’s aid departments put together. HC Deb 02 October 2019 | Vol 664 cc1209-1210 Climate Change Asked by: Neil Gray (Airdrie and Shotts) (SNP) What support his Department provides to help developing countries manage the effects of climate change. [911986] Asked by: Alex Chalk (Cheltenham) (Con) What steps his Department is taking to prioritise (a) tackling the effects of climate change and (b) protecting the environment in developing countries. [911991] Asked by: Rachel Maclean (Redditch) (Con) What steps his Department is taking to prioritise (a) tackling the effects of climate change and (b) protecting the environment in developing countries. [911996] Answered by: The Secretary of State for International Development (Rory Stewart) The distinction traditionally made between development, environment and climate is a false distinction. Unless we tackle climate change, there will be 100 million more people living in poverty in the next 15 years. I returned this morning from New York, where I have been discussing with the Secretary-General of the United Nations our commitment to greening our development spending to ensure that everything that we spend is Paris-compliant, to double the amount the Department for International Development will spend on environment and climate, and to double the effort we are putting into this subject. Neil Gray I thank the International Development Secretary for his answer and appreciate his focus on the importance of tackling climate change, but does he accept that it needs to be in addition to traditional development support? To that end, will he examine the Scottish Government’s climate justice fund, which seeks to support those who have done the least to cause climate change but who are to be hit first and hardest by its effects? Rory Stewart It is clearly true that many of the people who are suffering most are from some of the poorest countries in the world that emit very little carbon, which is why a great deal of our emphasis is on the question of  22 Number CDP 2020/0020, 3 February 2020  resilience. I have just returned from Kenya, for example, where we are working with pastoralists whose grassland is being eliminated and with people in Lamu who are losing mangrove swamps. Such countries are not emitting carbon but are suffering from its effects. Alex Chalk On that precise issue, what is being done to improve resilience in water security, to ensure that that does not become a source of conflict, or indeed disease, in future? Rory Stewart The question of water security is absolutely central. It poses the danger of conflict, for example in the Indus valley and along the headwaters of the rivers that flow into Egypt on the Nile. It is also an area where technology can help, however. We have become much better at preventing water waste. In many developing countries, 50% of the water is wasted; technology is part of the answer to this problem. Rachel Maclean My right hon. Friend has made it clear that some of the poorest countries in the world will be the most affected by climate change. I hope to visit Bangladesh in September as part of a delegation; what will his Department be doing to help countries such as Bangladesh mitigate the effects of severe weather, including the monsoon season? Rory Stewart The Department for International Development has partnered the Government of Bangladesh for many years, particularly because of the very severe impacts of flooding. We should pay tribute to the improvements in Bangladesh. In floods in the 1970s, more than 100,000 people could be killed in a single event; a similar event today would kill only a few hundreds. That is a huge tribute to Bangladesh’s improvement in resilience and also in emergency management. Dr Rosena Allin-Khan (Tooting) (Lab) I have worked with flood victims in refugee camps around the world; the despair is palpable and tragic, and it is simply inhumane that these same people will be hit the hardest by further extreme weather conditions. This House declared a climate change emergency; will the Government today outline how they will financially support the world’s most vulnerable and plan for dealing with future tragedies? Rory Stewart We will be doubling the overseas development fund, which will be spent particularly on climate resilience, and Britain will be co-hosting with Egypt the UN summit on climate resilience in September. That was the focus of my discussions with the UN Secretary-General yesterday, and indeed at the Abu Dhabi summit two weeks ago. Mr Barry Sheerman (Huddersfield) (Lab/Co-op) Does the Secretary of State agree that if we are truly to tackle climate change we need to ensure that the money that we give—the vital  Climate justice 23  money that we give—goes to the right place where it matters? Will he look at innovations such as digital currencies, especially blockchain, which enables the money to be tracked to make sure that it does not go into a dictator’s slush fund or to train Spice Girls in Nigeria? Rory Stewart Blockchain technology has very interesting potential. I recently saw in World Food Programme distribution in camps in Jordan how blockchain is dropping the price by tens of millions of dollars a year. However, there are still some risks attached to such technology. Patrick Grady (Glasgow North) (SNP) The right hon. Gentleman is perhaps the most diligent and committed Secretary of State for International Development that I and my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee West (Chris Law), who is still in New York with the Select Committee, have had the opportunity to question at the Dispatch Box. What steps is the right hon. Gentleman taking to solidify and embed the new priority of climate change in his Department? Will he commission a Green Paper or a White Paper to keep the Department moving in that direction, irrespective of what happens under a new Prime Minister in the coming weeks? Rory Stewart There are three things that we hope will embed the priority. First, this is a whole of Government approach. The Prime Minister announced at Osaka that we would be the first major international development agency to be fully Paris-compliant. Secondly, we have now announced from this Dispatch Box and inserted into our planning that we will double our spend on climate and the environment. The third thing is to ensure that we have the experts on the ground. In Kenya, for example, the focus is on environmental experts, and in Ethiopia it is on forestry experts. It will be funding, Government strategy and staffing that will make the difference. Sir Oliver Heald (North East Hertfordshire) (Con) Does my right hon. Friend agree that agricultural practice and land use are key to mitigating the effects of climate change? Will he say something about the training programmes that DFID pays for and that are doing such good work in helping people to understand the way forward? Rory Stewart DFID is doing an increasing amount of work on that issue. For example, its agricultural extension work is helping farmers to work out how to produce crops without depleting the soil or using excessive water. Perhaps the biggest challenge in agriculture is the relationship between pastoralists, particularly people herding cattle and oxen, and sedentary communities right the way across Africa, where climate change and agricultural practices are leading to conflict from Nigeria to South Sudan. Dan Carden (Liverpool, Walton) (Lab)  24 Number CDP 2020/0020, 3 February 2020  The UK is the largest contributor to the World Bank’s climate investment funds, yet civil society groups say that, compared with UN funds, those funds are undemocratic, opaque and dominated by donor countries. The Secretary of State has committed to doubling DFID’s climate spending, but does he think that the World Bank’s climate investment funds are fit for purpose? Rory Stewart The shadow Secretary of State is absolutely right to say that there have been significant issues around some of the climate funds. We feel that a lot of progress is being made, and the most important thing is to find real investable projects on the ground. A lot of that relates to issues of governance. Dan Carden I am grateful to the Secretary of State for that answer, but the truth is that the World Bank knows that it was supposed to phase out its climate investment funds once the United Nations green climate fund was up and running. Labour is clear: we believe in climate justice and we are committed to withdrawing the UK’s support for the World Bank’s climate investment funds and to redirecting climate finance to the UN green climate fund, in which developing countries get a real say. Will the Government now do the same? Rory Stewart No, we will not. The reason is that there are issues of capacity in both the World Bank and the UN. The key point here is not the ideological choice of the channel through which we pass the money but the capacity to manage these projects responsibly. HC Deb 17 July 2019 | Vol 663 c815 Global Warming Asked by: Christian Matheson (City of Chester) (Lab) If she will make reducing global warming a strategic priority of her Department. Asked by: Dr Roberta Blackman-Woods (City of Durham) (Lab) If she will make reducing global warming a strategic priority of her Department. Asked by: Jeff Smith (Manchester, Withington) (Lab) If she will make reducing global warming a strategic priority of her Department. Answered by: The Minister of State, Department for International Development (Harriett Baldwin) Climate change is a major threat to achieving the sustainable development goals, and tackling it is a strategic priority for the Government and for my Department. The Government are delivering  Climate justice 25  £5.8 billion in international climate finance to help developing countries to reduce emissions and to manage the impact of climate change. Christian Matheson Last Friday, thousands of children took to the streets, including in my own constituency, because they know that we have only 12 years left to make a difference on climate change. So why is the Department still spending money through its prosperity fund on expanding the oil and gas sectors in several countries where that fund is active? Harriett Baldwin I welcome the opportunity that the interest young people are showing in climate change gives us to highlight the important work that we are doing. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that we do not provide any bilateral assistance for coal-fired power generation, and that CDC, our private sector investment arm, has made no new net investments in coal-fired power since 2012. Dr Blackman-Woods Will the Minister update the House on what DFID is doing to follow through on the agreement made at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in 2018 to support urgent action to address climate change and to increase resilience to prevent 100 million more people from being pushed into poverty by 2030? Harriett Baldwin The hon. Lady is absolutely right to highlight the importance of commitments that were made last year at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting. There is an extensive programme of work to follow through on those commitments, not least the £5.8 billion of international climate finance that we have announced so far, which has already helped 47 million people to increase their resilience to climate change. We will be leading that strand at the United Nations summit in September. Jeff Smith The Minister said that there is no net investment from DFID and the CDC. I would be interested to know what she means by that, because we surely need a greater priority on disinvestment in oil and gas extraction. Is she not worried, as I am, about the possibility of stranded assets as a result of investments we have made in the global south? Harriett Baldwin We have an important role to play in working with our international bilateral partners to encourage the use of clean growth and clean energy. For example, the week before last, we held an event here in support of sustainable development goal 7 to which we invited African Energy Ministers from developing countries to meet some of the people we have in the UK with expertise on renewable energy. Michael Fabricant (Lichfield) (Con)  26 Number CDP 2020/0020, 3 February 2020  Solar energy is a relatively clean way to generate electricity. What steps are we taking in Africa to help not only people who are off-grid but those who are on-grid, too? Harriett Baldwin My hon. Friend is absolutely right that solar energy, particularly in sunny places, is a very good idea. Indeed, there is some very windy coastline where offshore wind energy would also be very helpful. In addition to the event that we held for African Energy Ministers the week before last, we have come up with some remarkable inventions using some of our overseas development assistance—for example, a solar-powered fridge. Antoinette Sandbach (Eddisbury) (Con) Will the Minister outline the steps the Department is taking to improve biodiversity and habitat enhancement, particularly through the recent investment in the Darwin initiative? Harriett Baldwin My hon. Friend will be glad to know that I work closely with my counterparts at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy to join up the work we are doing to tackle biodiversity, specifically the contribution we have made to the global environment fund. Robert Courts (Witney) (Con) Mangrove forests are one of the most effective habitats at storing carbon dioxide that might otherwise be released. What are the Government doing to help reduce mangrove forest loss? Harriett Baldwin We have rebranded them blue forests. We think they are incredibly important, and not only as a way to store carbon; recently it was proven that they also improve resilience to cyclones. They are an important part of the work and have been championed vigorously by the UnderSecretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk Coastal (Dr Coffey). Chris Law (Dundee West) (SNP) Last Friday, on the same day that 1.4 million children went on climate strike across the world, more than 1,000 people were killed in Mozambique and Zimbabwe during Cyclone Idai. Does the Minister agree that young people and those living in the developing world are the least responsible yet will bear the brunt of the climate crisis? If so, does she agree that the UK Government must make climate justice a key part of their climate change strategy? Harriett Baldwin That is exactly why the UK is proud to be stepping up our work on international climate finance. We have committed £5.8 billion to work with some of the poorer countries in the world, including those affected by this cyclone in Mozambique. There will be an urgent question later,  Climate justice 27  when I will be able to elaborate on the work that the UK has done to help with the situation there. Preet Kaur Gill (Birmingham, Edgbaston) (Lab/Co-op) Our thoughts are with all those affected by the devastation of Cyclone Idai across Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi, and I would like to share with the House the thoughts of—[Interruption.] Mr Speaker Order. There are a lot of noisy private conversations taking place. It is rather discourteous to the hon. Lady, who is highlighting very grave matters. Preet Kaur Gill Our thoughts are with all those affected by the devastation of Cyclone Idai across Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi, and I would like to share with the House the thoughts of Anabela Lemos, a woman at the forefront of the climate justice movement in Mozambique. She says: “The people of Mozambique need emergency response and support right now to survive this crisis. But this is also a harsh reminder that the climate crisis is upon us and developed countries need to urgently reduce their emissions and stop funding fossil fuels.” I welcome the relief package for the region issued by DFID, but it is a tragic irony of climate change that those least responsible are the ones who pay the highest price. A key component of the— Mr Speaker Order. This simply is not on. I do not wish to be unkind to the hon. Lady, but I need one sentence with a question mark at the end of it. My apologies for interrupting, but this is far too long. Preet Kaur Gill Will the Minister confirm whether the Government have plans to offer any additional climate finance to support vulnerable communities and countries to cope with the consequences of climate change? Harriett Baldwin I can confirm that we are already committed to spending £5.8 billion over this spending period, which will involve us being able to increase our finance over the next spending review period. There will be an urgent question later, when we can talk about the specific situation in Mozambique. The report from the Independent Commission for Aid Impact recently said that UK international climate finance is showing a very convincing approach, with some good emerging results in terms of influencing others. We aim to continue with that work.

[8. 2020_Net-Zero-Lifestyle] Library Briefing Net Zero Carbon Emissions Target and Climate Change: Role of Technological and Lifestyle Efforts Debate on 6 February 2020 On 6 February 2020, the House of Lords is due to debate a motion moved by Lord Browne of Ladyton (Labour) that “this House takes note, further to the report by UK FIRES, Absolute Zero, published in November 2019, of technological and lifestyle efforts (1) to address climate change, and (2) to meet the 2050 net zero carbon emissions target”. Summary UK FIRES is a research collaboration between five UK universities, the purpose of which is to investigate how to improve resource efficiency in industry. In November 2019 it published Absolute Zero, a report that describes how the UK could eliminate all its greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The authors contend that the UK should aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to absolute zero, rather than the “net zero” target specified in the Climate Change Act 2008 (as amended). This would mean not using carbon credits and including international shipping and aviation in the UK’s carbon calculations. UK FIRES also argues that politicians and other commentators have placed too much confidence in technologies that are not proven at scale to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For example, Absolute Zero does not include any role for carbon capture and storage or hydrogen as a source of energy in its description of how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In contrast, the Committee on Climate Change states that these technologies will be key in reducing the UK’s net carbon emissions. This briefing provides an overview of the Absolute Zero report, background to the UK greenhouse gas emissions target and an overview of the Government’s clean growth strategy. It then provides brief descriptions of some of the technological and lifestyle measures that have been advocated to reduce the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions. It compares assessments by UK FIRES, the Committee on Climate Change and the Centre for Alternative Technology about the potential and suitability of these measures. Further reading on the net zero target, the Clean Growth Strategy, and various technologies is suggested in the relevant sections. General further reading is suggested at the end of the document.

UK FIRES Report 1.1 What is UK FIRES? UK FIRES (UK Future Industrial Resource Efficiency Strategy) is a collaboration between the universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Nottingham, Bath and Imperial College London. 1 It is funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. UK FIRES aims to help the UK achieve its commitment to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 by increasing resource efficiency in industry. It plans to do this by bringing together businesses across the UK’s industrial supply chain “to pose strategic challenges to leading academics and test emerging solutions in practice”. 2 This will be done in a “living lab”, in which industry representatives will work with academics to test proposed solutions and suggest improvements. It also publishes research reports on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 1.2 What Does the Report Say? Absolute Zero, a report by UK FIRES, addresses the question of how best to eradicate the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The Climate Change Act 2008 (as amended) sets a UK target of “net zero” greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, calculated as the total emissions generated in the UK minus any offsets purchased. The report argues that this target is not sufficiently ambitious. 3 This is because it allows the Government to purchase carbon credits to offset any remaining emissions, and because it restricts the target to emissions that occur in the UK. This means the net zero measure excludes emissions from international shipping, international aviation and those generated abroad in making products for UK consumers. 4 The report argues that the UK should instead aim for “absolute zero” carbon emissions, phasing out aviation and shipping and not relying on carbon credits to offset any remaining emissions. UK FIRES also argues that politicians and other commentators have placed too much confidence in technologies that are not proven at scale to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Absolute Zero argues that “politicians in the UK and internationally talk about climate change as if it can be solved by new energy technologies alone, and UK government reports are over-confident about how much progress has been achieved”. 5 According to the report, “breakthrough technologies”, which would dramatically decrease emissions without requiring major lifestyle changes, cannot be delivered at a large enough scale to eradicate all the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The authors write that they are “concerned that most plans for dealing with climate change depend on breakthrough technologies—so won’t deliver in time”. 6 Instead, they argue, “the only solutions available in the time remaining require some change of lifestyle”. 7  1  UK FIRES, ‘About Us’, accessed 22 January 2020. ibid. 3 UK FIRES, Absolute Zero, 29 November 2019, p 4. 4 UK FIRES, Absolute Zero, 29 November 2019, p 4; and Climate Change Act 2008, s 30 (as amended). 5 UK FIRES, Absolute Zero, 29 November 2019, p 4. 6 ibid. 7 ibid, p 10. 2  3  The report sets out the changes the authors believe will be required to eliminate the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions, addressing the industrial sector and individuals separately. The report’s key message for the industrial sector highlights challenges for certain industries: Absolute Zero creates a driver for tremendous growth in industries related to electrification, from material supply, through generation and storage to end-use. The fossil fuel, cement, shipping and aviation industries face rapid contraction, while construction and many manufacturing sectors can continue at today’s scales, with appropriate transformations. 8 The report’s key actions for individuals include lifestyle changes such as reducing travel and the consumption of meat: The big actions are: travel less distance, travel by train or in small (or full) electric cars and stop flying; use the heating less and electrify the boiler when next upgrading; lobby for construction with half the material for twice as long; stop eating beef and lamb. Each action we take to reduce emissions, at home or at work, creates a positive ripple effect. 9 2. UK’s Emissions Reduction Target and Climate Change 2.1 Background Climate Change Act 2008 The Climate Change Act 2008 (as enacted) set a target for the UK to reduce its “net carbon account” to 80 percent lower than the 1990 baseline by 2050. 10 In the Act, the term “1990 baseline” is defined as the aggregate amount of net UK emissions of carbon dioxide in 1990, as well as net UK emissions of each of the other targeted greenhouse gases, the base years of which are set out in the Act. 11 The Act also established the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), an independent body. Its purpose is to advise the UK Government and devolved administrations on emissions targets and report to Parliament on progress made in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and preparing for climate change. 12 2016 Paris Agreement and Committee on Climate Change Recommendation The UK is a party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which recognised the existence of anthropogenic climate change and set out a need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 13 In 2016, the UK signed the Paris agreement, a further UN instrument to tackle 8  UK FIRES, Absolute Zero, 29 November 2019, p 2. ibid, p 3. 10 Climate Change Act 2008, s 1(1) (as enacted). 11 ibid, s 1(2). 12 Committee on Climate Change, ‘About the Committee on Climate Change’, accessed 24 January 2020. 13 United Nations Treaty Collection, ‘United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change’, accessed 24 January 2020; and United Nations Climate Change, ‘What Is the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change?’, accessed 24 January 2020. 9  4  climate change. 14 The overall aim of the Paris agreement is to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius (2°C) above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C. 15 Article 4 of the agreement states that to achieve this the parties must aim “to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century”, ie achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. 16 In October 2016, following the adoption of the Paris agreement, the Committee on Climate Change published a report recommending that the then Government not set a target for reducing the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions to net zero at that time. 17 The committee wrote: We agree with the Government’s intention to set a new target in future that reflects the global need to reach net zero emissions. However, to be credible it needs to be evidence-based, accompanied by strong policies to deliver existing targets and a strategy to develop greenhouse gas removals. 18 2018 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Report and Updated Committee on Climate Change Recommendation In October 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations body for assessing the science related to climate change, published a special report into the impact of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. 19 The report highlighted a number of climate change impacts that could be avoided by limiting global warming to 1.5°C rather than 2°C or more: For instance, by 2100, global sea level rise would be 10cm lower with global warming of 1.5°C compared with 2°C. The likelihood of an Arctic Ocean free of sea ice in summer would be once per century with global warming of 1.5°C, compared with at least once per decade with 2°C. Coral reefs would decline by 70–90 percent with global warming of 1.5°C, whereas virtually all (> 99 percent) would be lost with 2°C. 20 The report found that limiting global warming to 1.5°C would require global net anthropogenic carbon emissions to be zero by 2050. 21 However, the report also found that to limit global warming to 1.5°C “would require rapid and far-reaching transitions in energy, land, urban [environments] and infrastructure (including transport and buildings) and industrial systems”. 22 Following the publication of this report, the then Minister of State for Energy and Clean Growth, Claire Perry, along with then Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Environment, Climate 14  United Nations Treaty Collection, ‘Paris Agreement’, accessed 24 January 2020. ibid. 16 United Nations, Paris Agreement, article 4. 17 Committee on Climate Change, UK Climate Action Following the Paris Agreement, 13 October 2016, p 7. 18 ibid. 19 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, ‘Summary for Policymakers of IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C Approved by Governments’, 8 October 2018. 20 ibid. 21 ibid. 22 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Summary for Policymakers, 2018, p 15. 15  5  Change and Land Reform Roseanna Cunningham and then Cabinet Secretary for Energy, Planning and Rural Affairs Lesley Griffiths, wrote to the chair of the Committee on Climate Change, Lord Deben, to request updated advice on the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions reduction target. 23 In response to this request, in May 2019 the Committee on Climate Change published a report suggesting the UK adopt a target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The report said: A net zero [greenhouse gas] target for 2050 will deliver on the commitment that the UK made by signing the Paris agreement. It is achievable with known technologies, alongside improvements in people’s lives, and within the expected economic cost that Parliament accepted when it legislated the existing 2050 target for an 80 percent reduction from 1990. However, this is only possible if clear, stable and well-designed policies to reduce emissions further are introduced across the economy without delay. Current policy is insufficient for even the existing targets. 24 The committee recommended that the 100 percent reduction target should cover all sectors of the economy, including international aviation and shipping. 25 It also stated that “the aim should be to meet the target through UK domestic effort, without relying on international carbon units (or credits)”. 26 Climate Change Act 2008 Amended In June 2019, the Government laid before Parliament a statutory instrument to amend the greenhouse gas emissions reduction target. 27 The Climate Change Act 2008 (2050 Target Amendment) Order 2019 changed the target in section 1(1) of the Climate Change Act 2008 from an 80 percent reduction in the UK’s “net carbon account” by 2050 to a 100 percent reduction by 2050. 28 For more information on the UK’s net zero target, see the House of Commons Library briefing Net Zero in the UK (16 December 2019). 3. Government’s Clean Growth Strategy In October 2017, the then Government published a clean growth strategy. This document set out the actions the Government intended to take to enable it to meet its greenhouse gas emissions reduction target, which at that time was 80 percent lower than 1990 levels. The Government stated that its approach to reducing emissions had two guiding objectives: 1. 23  to meet our domestic commitments at the lowest possible net cost to UK taxpayers,  Minister of State for Energy and Clean Growth, ‘Letter to Chairman of the Committee on Climate Change’, 15 October 2018. 24 Committee on Climate Change, Net Zero: The UK’s Contribution to Stopping Global Warming, May 2019, p 11. 25 ibid, p 15. 26 ibid. 27 UK Parliament, ‘Climate Change Act 2008 (2050 Target Amendment) Order 2019’, accessed 24 January 2020. 28 Climate Change Act 2008 (2050 Target Amendment) Order 2019, SI 2019/1056.  6  2.  consumers and businesses; and to maximise the social and economic benefits for the UK from this transition. 29  In the strategy the Government set out its policies to reduce the country’s greenhouse gas emissions, in eight policy areas: • • • • • • • •  accelerating clean growth; improving business and industry efficiency; improving our homes; accelerating the shift to low-carbon transport; delivering clean, smart, flexible power; enhancing the benefits and value of our natural resources; leading in the public sector; and government leadership in driving clean growth. 30  In September 2019, Lord Duncan of Springbank, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State (Minister for Climate Change), responded to a question asked by Lord Teverson (Liberal Democrat) about whether the Government was planning to update its clean growth strategy in light of the revised emissions reduction target. Lord Duncan said: We will have an updated clean growth strategy because it is absolutely vital. We will need to be bold about taking ourselves forward to net zero by 2050, because our present initiatives are not adequate to deliver that. There will need to be a significant refresh not just of the wider clean growth strategy but of all aspects of this covering all government departments. 31 For more information on the clean growth strategy, see the House of Commons Library briefing Energy Efficiency and the Clean Growth Strategy (7 March 2018). 4. Technology This section provides a brief overview of some areas where technology could help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as well as areas where no technological solutions currently exist. 4.1 Reducing Energy Demand All models for significantly reducing the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions and reaching the net zero target necessitate significantly reducing energy demand. UK FIRES argues that by 2050 the UK’s energy demand will need to be reduced to 60 percent of its current level. 32 The Centre for Alternative Technology’s model for meeting the net zero target requires the UK’s energy demand to 29  Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Clean Growth Strategy, April 2018, p 10. ibid, pp 12–17. 31 HL Hansard, 9 September 2019, col 1288. 32 UK FIRES, Absolute Zero, 29 November 2019, p 14. 30  7  be approximately 49 percent of its current value. 33 The CCC’s scenarios for meeting the net zero target include a significant reduction in energy demand, particularly in buildings. 34 Buildings account for approximately 34 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the UK. 35 Technologies for reducing energy demand include heating delivered by heat pumps, improved efficiency of appliances, design of new buildings to minimise heating and cooling need, insulation and improved lighting efficiency. 36 4.2 Electricity Generation There is disagreement about the required composition of the UK’s future energy supply to enable the UK to meet its emissions reduction target. In particular, there is disagreement about the extent to which renewable energy, a source of emission-free energy, can be scaled up by 2050. In Absolute Zero, UK FIRES states that if current trends continue then the UK can be expected to generate around 580 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity without emissions per year by 2050. This would be composed of wind, solar, nuclear and biomass. 37 In contrast, the Centre for Alternative Technology has projected a greater role for renewable energy technologies in meeting the net zero target, particularly: liquid fuels produced from biomass; wave and tidal electricity generation; and offshore wind power. 38 The Centre for Alternative Technology predicts the UK could generate 780 TWh per year from renewables, and a further 365 TWh per year from biomass and ambient heat. 39 In its technical note accompanying its recommendation that the UK adopt a net zero target the CCC suggests that renewables and nuclear power together could provide most of the energy needed to reduce the UK’s emissions from energy production to “close to zero”. 40 However, it also states that a significant proportion of energy generation would need to be provided by gas-fired plants fitted with carbon capture and storage. 4.3 Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage Carbon capture and storage (CCS) refers to technologies that can capture carbon dioxide from waste gases at industrial facilities, and store it in offshore geological storage sites indefinitely. 41 It could also be reused in industrial processes, a process which is referred to as carbon capture and usage (CCU). The two technologies are sometimes referred to together as CCUS. The Government and the CCC are counting upon significant deployment of CCS technology to meet 33  Centre for Alternative Technologies, Zero Carbon Britain, 2019, p 39. Committee on Climate Change, Net Zero Technical Report, May 2019, pp 23 and 69. 35 Committee on Climate Change, Factsheet: Buildings, July 2015. 36 UK FIRES, Absolute Zero, 29 November 2019, p 17. 37 ibid, p 11. 38 UK FIRES, Absolute Zero, 29 November 2019, p 42; and Centre for Alternative Technologies, Zero Carbon Britain, 2019, p 56. 39 Centre for Alternative Technologies, Zero Carbon Britain, 2019, p 56. 40 Committee on Climate Change, Net Zero Technical Report, May 2019, p 40. 41 House of Commons Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, Carbon Capture Usage and Storage: Third Time Lucky?, 25 April 2019, HC 1094 of session 2017–19, p 5. 34  8  the country’s net zero target. The CCC states that “achieving deep emissions reductions in the UK's power sector is contingent on CCS infrastructure and deployment support being available by 2030”. 42 A report by the House of Commons Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee in April 2019 concluded that “carbon capture usage and storage is necessary to meet national and international climate change targets at least cost”. 43 It also contended that not using CCS would double the cost to the UK of meeting its previous commitment of an 80 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and would mean it “could not credibly adopt a ‘net zero emissions’ target in line with the Paris agreement’s 1.5°C aspiration”. 44 In contrast, the Absolute Zero report warns against relying on CCS to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the UK by 2050. The report argues that while the technological elements of CCS have all been proven at some scale, “until a first fleet of full-scale power-plants are operating, the risks and costs of further expansion will remain high and uncertain”. 45 The Government has stated its support for CCUS, but has said that its commitment to deploying CCUS in the UK is “subject to cost reduction”. 46 In its report on CCUS, the House of Commons Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee said that the lack of specificity in the Government’s ambitions does not indicate a commitment commensurate with the importance of this technology. It recommended that the Government “prioritise the development of clear ambitions to kick-start CCUS”. 47 4.4 Electrification If the UK is to meet the net zero greenhouse gas emissions target, a significant proportion of future energy demand would need to be in the form of electricity as opposed to gas, petrol or other fossil fuels. 48 In UK FIRES’ model for eliminating emissions, all energy demand must be in the form of electricity; they argue that this is because renewable and nuclear-produced electricity are the only proven scalable sources of emission-free energy. 49 The Committee on Climate Change states that to meet the target would require “extensive electrification, particularly of transport and heating”. 50 The Centre for Alternative Technology’s model requires 66 percent of the UK’s future energy demand to be in the form of electricity, with the rest composed of biogas, synthetic gas and liquid fuels. 51 The Centre for Alternative Technology maintains that these other fuel types are necessary for industry, transport and energy back-up.  42  Committee on Climate Change, Net Zero Technical Report, Map 2019, p 44.

Heat pumps are already an established technology in many other countries. 53 However, the CCC highlights that in the UK installation of heat pumps remains at very low levels “despite generous funding under the renewable heat incentive”. 54 The CCC also notes that “it is not feasible to ramp up installation rates of heat pumps straight away to the current level of gas boiler sales (over a million per year) from the current level of 20,000 per year, not only due to the lack of market development but also because there are not enough qualified heat pump installers”. 55 Transport Almost all transport currently involves the direct combustion of fossil fuels in the vehicle; only 1 percent of transport is powered by electricity. 56 Transport is currently the largest source of UK greenhouse gas emissions, and emissions from transport rose between 2013 and 2017. 57 To significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, most transport would need to be powered by electricity. UK FIRES argues that all transport must either be electrified or phased out. 58 The CCC’s scenario for meeting the net zero target would require all cars and vans to be electric and the “vast majority” of heavy goods vehicles to be either electric or hydrogen-powered by 2050. In 2018, the then Government published a strategy for increasing ownership of electric vehicles, entitled Road to Zero. 59 This document set out the Government’s ambition for “almost every car and van” to be zero emission by 2050. 60 The Government stated it would offer grants and other consumer incentives for certain types of low emission vehicle, support research in the industry and invest in charging infrastructure. For more information on the Government’s policy on low emission vehicles, see the House of Commons Library briefing Electric Vehicles and Infrastructure (13 January 2020). 4.5 Hydrogen Some fossil fuels could be replaced with hydrogen. The combustion of hydrogen produces almost no greenhouse gases, providing an emission-free source of energy. However, the production of hydrogen itself can lead to greenhouse gas emissions, depending on the method used. 61 Hydrogen could be used in the UK to replace natural gas and liquid fuels. 62 Hydrogen gas does not currently supply the UK gas 52  Committee on Climate Change, Net Zero: The UK’s Contribution to Stopping Global Warming, May 2019, p 187. ibid, p 178. 54 ibid, p 48. 55 ibid, p 176. 56 UK FIRES, Absolute Zero, 29 November 2019, p 18. 57 Committee on Climate Change, Net Zero: The UK’s Contribution to Stopping Global Warming, May 2019, p 48. 58 UK FIRES, Absolute Zero, 29 November 2019, p 8. 59 Office for Low Emission Vehicles, The Road to Zero, 12 September 2018. 60 ibid, pp 2–4. 61 Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, Decarbonising the Gas Network, November 2017, p 2. 62 Committee on Climate Change, Hydrogen in a Low-Carbon Economy, November 2018, p 8. 53  10  network, though it is used by industry in Europe and North America. The CCC’s scenario for meeting the net zero target includes the development of a “hydrogen economy” to provide energy in sectors where gas or other fuel use cannot be eliminated, such as long-distance shipping and some industrial processes. 63 UK FIRES contends that “the hydrogen economy”, along with CCUS, is an important development opportunity and may be significant beyond 2050, but will not play any significant part in national emissions reduction by 2050 because implementation at a meaningful scale will take too long. 64 For more information on hydrogen as a source of energy, see the briefing by the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, Decarbonising the Gas Network (15 November 2017). 4.6 Industrial Processes: Cement and Iron The Absolute Zero report highlights the greenhouse gas emissions associated with certain industrial processes, particularly making cement and iron. In addition to the emissions related to the energy required from these processes, blast furnaces making steel from iron ore and coke release carbon dioxide, and half of the emissions from cement production come from the chemical reaction as limestone is calcined to become clinker. 65 There are currently no proven, scalable alternatives to these processes, therefore reducing the UK’s emissions to absolute zero would require no cement-based mortar or concrete, and no new steel. 66 UK FIRES states that “the absence of cement is the greatest single challenge in delivering absolute zero, as it is currently essential to delivering infrastructure, buildings and new energy technologies”. 67 The CCC acknowledges that greenhouse gas emissions cannot be eliminated from these processes. Its scenario for reaching net zero includes using CCS for certain industrial processes, including the production of cement and iron. 68 5. Lifestyle This section provides a brief overview of two of the areas where UK FIRES recommends the most significant lifestyle changes in order to reduce the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. 5.1 Air Travel and Shipping The net zero target in the Climate Change Act 2008 (as amended) does not include emissions from international air travel or shipping. 69 However, UK FIRES argues that for the UK’s efforts to eliminate carbon emissions to be meaningful carbon emissions from aviation and shipping cannot be ignored. In 63  Committee on Climate Change, Net Zero: The UK’s Contribution to Stopping Global Warming, May 2019, p 23. UK FIRES, Absolute Zero, 29 November 2019, p 43. 65 ibid, p 15. When a material is calcined, it is reduced to quick-lime by burning. 66 ibid. 67 ibid. 68 Committee on Climate Change, Net Zero: The UK’s Contribution to Stopping Global Warming, May 2019, p 146. 69 Climate Change Act 2008, s 30 (as amended). 64  11  his foreword to the CCC’s report on meeting the net zero target, Lord Deben, chair of the committee, also stated that it is essential that the commitment cover international aviation and shipping. 70 UK FIRES argues that there are currently no proven technological alternatives to fossil fuels for aviation and shipping, and therefore these modes of transport must be phased out entirely. The CCC argues that it is possible to reduce emissions from aviation by design and other technical changes, but some emissions would remain, and these would need to be removed from the atmosphere. 71 The CCC contends that emissions from shipping could be significantly reduced by improved energy efficiency and operations and use of alternative fuels. 72 5.2 Diet and Agriculture A key element of UK FIRES’ strategy to eliminate the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions is the phasing out of agricultural production of ruminant animals, particularly beef and lamb. 73 There are several processes by which the rearing of cows and sheep leads to greenhouse gas emissions: • • • • •  The way these animals digest food releases methane, a greenhouse gas. Converting forestry to agricultural land releases carbon stored in the forest. Future carbon storage is lost when trees are destroyed. Ploughing land releases carbon stored in the soil. Using nitrogen-based fertilisers leads to emissions.  Growing grain to feed to animals is particularly inefficient, as approximately 80 times more grain is required to create the same calories for a meal of meat as a meal made from grain. 74 UK FIRES argues that because of these processes, reaching zero emissions in 2050 would require “that we refrain from eating beef and lamb”. 75 The CCC identifies agriculture as one of the hardest sectors in which to reduce emissions. It states that emissions from agriculture can be somewhat reduced through livestock, soils and waste manure management. 76 In addition, its scenario for meeting the net zero target includes a 20 percent reduction in consumption of beef, lamb and dairy. 77 The land released could then be converted into forest, or used for peatland restoration or the growing of energy crops. The Centre for Alternative Technology also recommends a significant reduction in consumption of animal products in favour of plant-based foods in order to meet the net zero target. 78  70  Committee on Climate Change, Net Zero: The UK’s Contribution to Stopping Global Warming, May 2019, p 8. ibid, p 148. 72 ibid, p 146. 73 UK FIRES, Absolute Zero 29 November 2019, p 15. 74 ibid. 75 ibid. 76 Committee on Climate Change, Net Zero: The UK’s Contribution to Stopping Global Warming, May 2019, p 142. 77 ibid, p 147. 78 Centre for Alternative Technologies, Zero Carbon Britain, 2019, p 88. 71  12  The Government’s Clean Growth Strategy states that the Government will introduce policies to improve efficiency in the land and agricultural sectors, including improving biosecurity and encouraging the use of low-emissions fertiliser. 79 The Agriculture Bill, introduced in the current session, includes provisions that would enable the secretary of state to provide financial assistance in connection with managing land, water or livestock in such a way as to mitigate the causes of climate change. 80 For example, this assistance could be given to promote measures that incentivise peatland restoration. 6.

This information is designed to help you navigate the pages that follow and find quickly the content of most interest to you. This report contains:   Forewords from the commissioning select committee Chairs and the assembly’s Expert Leads that place the assembly and its report in context;    An opening statement from the assembly members themselves that highlights the key themes emerging from their recommendations. This statement is an excellent place to start for anyone wanting an overarching picture of the assembly’s results;    The executive summary lists the assembly’s main recommendations in each of the ten areas that it considered. It also contains a brief introduction to the assembly itself. Alongside the opening statement, it is designed to give an overview of the assembly’s recommended path to net zero;  Climate Assembly UK ― The path to net zero    Chapter 1 provides details of the assembly’s process and membership;    Chapters 2–11 outline in depth the assembly’s recommendations and the rationale behind them. These chapters are organised by policy area: for example, how we travel, heat and energy use in the home, and what we buy. They will be particularly useful to policy-makers, researchers and others working in detail on the areas considered by the assembly. These chapters are designed to stand alone so that readers can go straight to the chapters of most interest to them.  2  About the detailed chapters Chapters 2–11 each contain:   A quick summary of key recommendations on the relevant theme at the chapter’s start, for ease of reference;    The assembly’s formal recommendations, decided by secret ballot. This includes full results of all votes;    Assembly members’ rationale for their decisions, captured through notes from their small group conversations and responses on their ballot papers. Assembly members have checked these sections to verify their accuracy;    Some assembly members noted conditions to their support for recommendations, or points for decision-makers to bear in mind around their implementation. We have included these in full.  This report does not contain transcripts of the information presented to the assembly by the forty-seven speakers who gave evidence to it. You can find these, alongside videos of the presentations and the speakers slides, at climateassembly.uk/resources/.  The Climate Assembly UK team  Please note: Assembly members were asked to think about both the advantages and disadvantages of potential recommendations, and we have included full accounts of what they said. This means there are disadvantages listed for recommendations the assembly strongly supported, and advantages listed for recommendations that they did not. We have also left in contradictory opinions, where they existed. Assembly members’ votes show the relative importance that they placed on the advantages and disadvantages they identified, and their final decisions having considered all points of view.  Climate Assembly UK ― The path to net zero  3  Foreword from Committee Chairs When Parliament agreed in June 2019 to set in law a commitment to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 that was the easy part. The hard bit is to determine how we get there and then do it. How should we go about making those choices? What is the contribution of each sector to achieving a decarbonised economy? Because whatever combination of policy choices is made, there will be an impact on every taxpayer, every business, on the way every one of us lives our lives. No government in a democracy can address climate change on its own; it is a communal effort requiring the input, understanding and support of the people. Almost every facet of life and policy area will be affected. That is why six select committees joined together last year to set up a citizens’ assembly on climate change. When Parliament legislated on net zero, the committees decided to make the focus of the assembly how this target should be reached. We asked it to consider the complex trade-offs involved in reaching decisions on issues including: how we travel; what we eat; what we buy; how we heat our homes; how we generate our electricity; how we use the land. The voice of Climate Assembly UK is important because it is unique: a body whose composition mirrors that of the UK population. People from all walks of life taking the time to inform themselves on complex issues, discussing the topics with experts and each other, and reaching conclusions. On behalf of the six select committees that established Climate Assembly UK, we want to express our gratitude to all the 108 assembly members who gave up their time to take part. We have been enormously impressed by their commitment, not least in wanting to complete  Climate Assembly UK ― The path to net zero  the assembly online after the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic made it impossible to hold the final weekend in Birmingham. We also want to thank the assembly for giving us such a clear set of recommendations on the path to take. Assembly members were clear on the underlying principles that should govern our policy choices, including the importance of information and education and the need for fairness, to support those who might be adversely affected by the transition to net zero. They were clear on the need for Government to lead the debate and take the actions necessary to reach net zero. And they were clear on the need for a cross-party consensus, to give longterm certainty on the policy choices made. Forging consensus is what we do on our cross-party select committees, on the basis of the evidence and what in our judgement is acceptable to the public. That is why the considered view of the assembly is so important. In each of our committees, we will study the relevant recommendations of the assembly and the reasons behind them, to inform our work in advising the Government on how to make progress in our respective policy areas and holding it to account for any slacking. The path to net zero must be a joint endeavour, between Parliament, the people, Government and business. The assembly has more than delivered on the task we set it last year. The challenge is now for us in Parliament and for Government to navigate the pathways that have been set out in order to reach our agreed destination of net zero by 2050.  Darren Jones MP Chair, Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee  Mel Stride MP Chair, Treasury Committee  4  Foreword from the Expert Leads1 The UK is one of the first countries to commit to achieving net zero emissions, and will host next year’s international climate summit, COP26. This is an important period to show how leadership on climate change can be sustained at a time when the world is dealing with the impacts of the global coronavirus pandemic. The UK has already made good progress with emissions reductions, but meeting future carbon budgets and the net zero target will be very challenging. Action is needed to transform our economy and society. This transformation will not only be achieved through ramping up investment in technologies such as electric cars, offshore wind farms and home insulation. Citizens also have a crucial role to play. The way we live our lives, what we buy, how we travel and what we eat will all have an influence. So it is essential to work with citizens to make sure their views are heard, and develop strategies that fit with people’s lives and aspirations. Climate Assembly UK is a unique process that has helped to meet this need. It has brought together a representative group of 108 citizens and provided them with the space to understand, discuss and prioritise actions the UK should take. The assembly took many hours of planning. We worked closely with Involve and the assembly’s advisory groups to ensure that members would be provided with fair, balanced and comprehensive evidence on the different ways in which net zero could be achieved. This included a lot of time for the members to ask questions, discuss the evidence with each other, and to reach conclusions. There was also an opportunity 1 2  to discuss topics that assembly members themselves considered to be important. The value of all the planning became clear once the assembly began to meet in January. The 108 participants were no longer just a statistical sample of the population – but a real, diverse group of citizens from all over the UK. They were fully engaged from start to finish: questioning speakers, debating and testing different points of view. The team from Involve2 did a fantastic job of facilitating this process, and ensuring a wide range of views were heard in a respectful and balanced way. This report provides detailed insights into the discussions and decisions of assembly members. The results of the votes will inevitably catch the eye. But the report also shows how nuanced the discussions were – including the reasons for assembly members’ views, and the all-important conditions attached to some of the decisions. This report provides vital new intelligence about the views of the UK public on the way forward. We strongly encourage decisionmakers in government, industry and other organisations to read it in detail – and to take these views into account.

Climate Assembly UK ― The path to net zero  5  Opening statement from Assembly Members We come from all walks of life and all across the UK. We have, between us, many different values, views and experiences. But we have worked together in an atmosphere of respect, co-operation, tolerance and humour to arrive at the considered recommendations in this report. Our recommendations and the reasons for them are necessarily numerous and detailed. But there are a number of themes that have recurred throughout our discussions that we believe should be at the heart of government’s and Parliament’s approach to achieving net zero:     Education and information: there is a need for information and education for everyone – individuals, businesses, government and others – about climate change and the steps needed to tackle it. It is essential for buy-in to the changes that are needed. Fairness: as with most things in life, the solutions to climate change are neither easy nor free, but they need to be fair. Fair to people with jobs in different sectors. Fair to people with different incomes, travel preferences and housing arrangements. Fair to people who live in different parts of the UK.  Climate Assembly UK ― The path to net zero    Freedom and choice: we believe it is important to maintain, wherever possible, freedom and choice for both individuals and local areas so that they can choose the solutions that work best for them. This should not be at the expense of taking the steps necessary to ensure a safe and healthy environment for future generations. We have outlined in this report where we believe an acceptable balance lies.    Co-benefits: tackling climate change could bring with it many advantages. It could see benefits for local communities, high streets and local businesses. It could boost our economy and promote innovation, including in technology. And it could improve our health and reduce pollution. The UK should take advantage of these potential rewards.    Nature: we need to protect and restore our natural environment, and our access to it. We strongly support measures that have a positive impact on biodiversity and wildlife, whilst also helping the UK move towards its net zero goal.  6  Above: Assembly members listen to a speaker.  Some of our strongest views centre on leadership and roles. It is imperative that there is strong and clear leadership from government – leadership to forge a cross-party consensus that allows for certainty, long-term planning and a phased transition. This is not the time nor the issue for scoring party political points. The Covid-19 pandemic that has caused so much suffering brings with it new considerations, but it does not change the need for progress towards the UK’s climate goals.  Climate Assembly UK ― The path to net zero  Alongside government leadership, we recognise that achieving net zero will require a joined-up approach across society – all of us will have to play our part. Our recommendations take account of this reality. They seek to provide individuals, communities and organisations with the information, incentives and conditions to make change possible. We hope that our report will be an invaluable resource to government and Parliament as they work to ensure that the UK reaches net zero by 2050.  7  Executive summary  About Climate Assembly UK In June 2019, the UK Government and Parliament agreed that the UK should do more to tackle climate change. They passed a law committing the UK to reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Decisions about how the target is reached will affect many aspects of people’s lives. 1 Climate Assembly UK was commissioned by six select committees of the House of Commons1 to examine the question: “How should the UK meet its target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050?” The committees aim to use the assembly’s results to inform their work in scrunitising government. 2 The assembly’s 108 members come from all walks of life. Together they are representative of the UK population in terms of: age, gender, ethnicity, educational level, where in the UK they live, whether they live in an urban or a rural area, and their level of concern about climate change.2 The Sortition Foundation recruited assembly members using a process known as ‘sortition’ (please see Chapter 1). Access, inclusion and  1  2  assembly members’ wellbeing were a priority for the Climate Assembly UK team. I was a bit worried that it would just be the “ people who were most passionate about the crisis – that you’d get an influx of people so it would be very one-sided and biased. So to come in and find it is a complete representation: I’ve spoken to people for who it’s a complete crisis – to complete denial or don’t believe it’s a real thing, that end of the spectrum. So to see that representation was quite a surprise and really refreshing for someone like myself.” Assembly member – Chris, 32, from Oxford  3 The assembly met for six weekends between late January and mid-May 2020 – the first three took place face-to-face in Birmingham; the last three online after the arrival of Covid-19 in the UK. At the weekends, assembly members heard balanced, accurate and comprehensive information about  The six commissioning select committees were: Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy; Environmental Audit; Housing, Communities and Local Government; Science and Technology; Transport; and Treasury. The committees announced their plans for the assembly on 20 June 2019. For full figures comparing assembly members to the UK population, please see Chapter 1.  Climate Assembly UK ― The path to net zero  10  Above: Sir David Attenborough addresses Climate Assembly UK.  how the UK could meet its net zero target.3 They then engaged in detailed discussions about the best way forwards, before reaching their recommendations. 4 The assembly considered ten topics in total:  3 4    Underpinning principles for the path to net zero (Chapter 2);    How we travel on land (Chapter 3);    How we travel by air (Chapter 4);    Heat and energy use in the home (Chapter 5);    What we eat and how we use the land (Chapter 6);    What we buy (Chapter 7);    Where our electricity comes from (Chapter 8);    Greenhouse gas removals (Chapter 9);    The changed context created by Covid-19 (Chapter 10).    Additional recommendations (Chapter 11).  5 The assembly was open and transparent, whilst protecting assembly members’ identities. Speakers’ presentations were publicly available via online live-stream as they happened, and can now be found on the Climate Assembly UK website.4 The assembly was open to a wide range of media, stakeholders, officials and politicians so that they could observe its proceedings. 6 The assembly was funded by the House of Commons, with additional funding from two philanthropic organisations: the Esmée Fairbairn Foundation and the European Climate Foundation. The two philanthropic organisations did not have a say in how the assembly was run or what it covered. Delivery of the assembly was led by The Involve Foundation (‘Involve’), with the Sortition Foundation and mySociety (please see Chapter 1). The path to net zero: Climate Assembly UK report recounts the assembly’s detailed and considered view of its recommended path to net zero by 2050. Taken together the recommendations provide an internally consistent and coherent vision, and are designed to be considered as a whole.  For more information about the assembly’s 47 speakers and how they were chosen, including the roles of the assembly’s Expert Leads, Advisory Panel and Academic Panel please see Chapter 1. The website also contains a wealth of other information about the assembly, including how it was funded and who was involved. See climateassembly.uk  Climate Assembly UK ― The path to net zero  11  Underpinning principles Assembly members’ first decision was on the principles that should underpin the UK’s path to net zero. They worked in small groups to discuss and draft the principles, before using a vote to prioritise them. In total, assembly members agreed twenty-five underpinning principles for the path to net zero. Votes indicate how many assembly members felt a principle should be a priority, not how many supported it.5  Principles for the path to net zero, in order of priority 1.  2.  3.  4.  Informing and educating everyone (the public, industry, individuals and government) – 74 votes Fairness within the UK, including for the most vulnerable (affordability, jobs, UK regions, incentives and rewards) in actions, not just words – 65 votes Leadership from government that is clear, proactive, accountable and consistent – 63 votes Protecting and restoring the natural world – 59 votes  5.  Ensuring solutions are future-proofed and sustainable for the future – 45 votes  6.  A joined-up approach across the system and all levels of society (working together, collaborating, sharing) – 40 votes  7.  Long-term planning and a phased transition – 39 votes  8.  Urgency – 37 votes  9.  Support for sustainable growth (including pioneering innovation) – 37 votes  10. Local community engagement  embedded in national solutions – 33 votes 11. Think about our impact globally  and be a global leader – 32 votes 12. Use of mix of natural and  technological solutions – 32 votes 13. Transparency and honesty – 32 votes 14.

Those who bear the most  responsibility should act – 13 votes 25. Not negatively impacting other  institutions – 4 votes Assembly members returned to these principles, and considerations related to them, throughout the assembly.  13  How we travel on land The ways we travel on land include cars, vans and lorries, as well public transport like buses, coaches and trains. They also include ‘active transport’, for example walking, cycling and scootering. Together these ways of moving around account for 70% of the UK’s total greenhouse gas emissons from transport and 23% of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions overall.6 Key recommendations    Ensure solutions are accessible and affordable to all sections of society;    Help create significant change at an individual level, including through education, incentives and disincentives;    A ban on the sale of new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars by 2030–2035;  Achieve cross-party support for decisions so that they are not changed by successive governments;    A reduction in the amount we use cars by an average of 2–5% per decade;  Follow the principle that the polluter should pay;    Check and be careful about side effects, including moral, ethical and environmental implications;    Invest in and develop public transport to make it accessible and affordable;    Invest more and faster in research and development for technologies;    Ask an independent regulator to assess long-term consequences of the science and policies;  1 Assembly members recommended a future which minimises restrictions on travel and lifestyles, placing the emphasis on shifting to electric vehicles and improving public transport, rather than on large reductions in car use. They recommended:       Improved public transport.  2 Assembly members identified 18 considerations that they would like government and Parliament to bear in mind when looking at how we travel on land and the path to net zero. A full list can be found in Chapter 3. Assembly members’ ten highest priority considerations were:  6  Climate Assembly UK considered our travel on land for personal uses such as shopping, the school run and commuting. The assembly did not look at transport used for services and to move goods, also known as freight. This followed guidance from Parliament about where to focus if there was not time to consider all aspects of land travel.  Climate Assembly UK ― The path to net zero  14  Above: An assembly member asks a speaker a question.    Protect jobs and industry, and support them to transition;    Bringing public transport back under government control (75%);    Free bus travel, as introduced in Dunkirk.7    Increasing investment to make buses faster and more reliable (66%).  3 In addition, assembly members recommended fifteen policies aimed at moving quickly to low carbon vehicles, increasing public and active transport, or discouraging car ownership and use. Policies supported by at least two-thirds of assembly members were: On public transport  8 9    Quickly stop selling the most polluting vehicles (86%);    Grants for businesses and people to buy low carbon cars (74%);    Car scrappage scheme (66%).  On active transport    Government investment in low carbon buses and trains (91%);8    Adding new bus routes and more frequent services (86%);  On travelling less  Making public transport cheaper (83%);      7  On the cars we drive    Investing in cycling and scootering facilities (70%).  Localisation (72%).9  This refers to a case study presented by one of the speakers, Lynn Sloman, during weekend two of the assembly. It showed the impact of introducing free bus travel in Dunkirk in autumn 2018. Bus trips increased by 85% on some routes, and half of the new bus users previously travelled by car. % of assembly members who ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that the policy should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. ‘Localisation’ was described as involving (1) changing regulations to ensure that new houses can only be built with good public transport links, and (2) including or putting back into local areas services such as post offices, local shops, health centres and schools.  Climate Assembly UK ― The path to net zero  15  How we travel by air Air travel accounts for 22% of the UK’s total greenhouse gas emissions from transport, and 7% of the UK’s total greenhouse gas emissions overall. Emissions from flying have grown significantly in the last 30 years.10 Key recommendations 1 Assembly members identified 14 considerations that they would like government and Parliament to bear in mind when looking air travel and the path to net zero. A full list can be found in Chapter 4. Assembly members’ ten highest priority considerations were:   Speed up technological progress;    Influence the rest of the world;    Even out the costs of air travel compared to alternatives;    Frequent fliers and those that fly further should pay more;    Stay competitive and protect the economy;    Engage the population in making the necessary changes;    Take account of different travel needs (e.g. people with family far away);    Promote and incentivise UK holidays;    Scrap incentives to make people fly more (e.g. air miles, first class);    Ban polluting private jets and helicopters, moving to electric when possible.  What the future should look like 2 Assembly members would like to see a solution to air travel emissions that allows people to continue to fly. Assembly members felt that this would protect people’s freedom and happiness, as well as having benefits for business and the economy. 3 Assembly members’ support for continued flying did, however, have limits. Assembly members resoundingly rejected a future in which air passenger numbers would rise by as much as 65% between 2018 and 2050, labelling it “counterproductive”. Instead, assembly members sought to find an acceptable balance between achieving the net zero target, impacts on lifestyles, reliance on new technologies, and investment in alternatives.  10 Climate Assembly UK considered air travel for personal use. The assembly did not look at air travel for the transportation of goods. This followed guidance from Parliament on where to focus, if there was not time to consider both.  Climate Assembly UK ― The path to net zero  16  4 Assembly members recommended a future in which:   Growth in air passenger numbers is limited to 25–50% between 2018 and 2050, depending on how quickly technology progresses. This is a lower rate of growth per year than was seen in recent times prior to Covid-19;    30m tonnes of CO2 is still emitted by the aviation sector in 2050 and requires removing from the atmosphere;    There is investment in alternatives to air travel.  How change should happen 5 80% of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that taxes that increase as people fly more often and as they fly further should be part of how the UK gets to get zero (see Figure 1). Assembly members saw these taxes as fairer than alternative policy options. They also suggested a number of points around their implementation for policy-makers to bear in mind.  6 Assembly members would like to see the airline industry invest in greenhouse gas removals. 75% of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that this should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. There was also significant support for financial incentives from government to encourage a wide range of organisations to invest. Assembly members tended to feel that ‘the polluter should pay’, although some suggested a need to monitor, scrutinise and perhaps enforce airline industry investment to ensure it actually takes place. 7 Assembly members strongly supported the need to invest in the development and use of new technologies for air travel. 87% of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that this should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. These technologies could include electric aircraft and synthetic fuels.

Reducing these emissions means changes to the use of heating, hot water and electricity in the home.11 Key recommendations Assembly members’ recommendations on heat and energy use in the home show a strong push for action. They also consistently emphasised their support for:   Tailored solutions, enabling local authorities and other local organisations to chose solutions suited to their local areas, and householders to pick the options best for them;    Increased choice, including through steps to increase competition;    Reliable and clear information for the public;    A need for solutions to work for all income groups and housing types.  Some assembly members noted concerns about the influence and behaviour of big companies and around the use of personal data.  What the future should look like 1 On home retrofits, assembly members emphasised the need to minimise disruption in the home, put in place support around costs, and offer flexibility and choice to homeowners. They had a slight preference for upgrading each home all in one go (56%), compared to upgrading each home gradually (44%) but attached conditions to the former around how it is financed. Some assembly members stressed that the choice between gradual and all-in-one retrofits should be one for homeowners. 2 The best technology to use for zero carbon heating is a matter of significant policy debate. However at least 80% of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that each of hydrogen (83%), heat pumps (80%), and heat networks (80%) should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. 3 94% of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that “people in different parts of the country should be offered different solutions to zero carbon heating” (see Figure 2 overleaf). They argued that areas should be able to choose the technologies best suited to their needs.  11 https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/862887/2018_Final_ greenhouse_gas_emissions_statistical_release.pdf  Climate Assembly UK ― The path to net zero  18  How change should happen Assembly members emphasised the need for a long-term strategy with a wide range of actors taking steps to move the sector towards net zero. Assembly members strongly supported roles for government investment (80%), local solutions (80%), individual responsibility (80%) and market innovation (80%). 4 Assembly members also backed a wide range of specific measures to create change. A majority of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that 19 policy measures should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. Policies supported by at least two-thirds of assembly members were:   Support for smaller organisations to offer energy services (94%);    Simpler consumer protection measures (92%);    Changes to product standards to make products more energy efficient and ‘smart’ (91%);    Local plans for zero carbon homes (89%);    A ban on sales of new gas boilers from 2030 or 2035 (86%);  Above: One of the speakers, Dr Modi Mwatsama from Wellcome, presents to the assembly.    Changes to energy market rules to allow more companies to compete (86%);    Changes to VAT on energy efficiency and zero carbon heating products (83%);    Information and support funded by government (83%), or information and support provided by government (72%);    Government help for everyone (69%), or government help for poorer households (68%);    Enforcing district heating networks (66%).

In total, about a tenth of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions currently come from farming and ways we use the land. Key recommendations 1 Assembly members put forward eight considerations for government and Parliament to bear in mind when making decisions about food, farming, land use and the path to net zero. These focussed on (for the full, detailed wording please see Chapter 6): 1.  Providing support to farmers;  2.  Information and education;  3.  Using land efficiently;  4.  Rules for large retailers and supermarkets;  5.  More local and seasonal food;  6.  Making low carbon food more affordable;  7.  Some, just less, meat;  8.  Considering net zero as part of planning policy and new developments, including support for allotments.  Climate Assembly UK ― The path to net zero  What the future should look like 2 Assembly members recommended a future for food, farming and land use in the UK centred around:   Local produce and local food production – assembly members noted potential community benefits, fairer prices for farmers, a ‘feel good factor’ and reduced environmental impacts;    A change in diet to reduce meat and dairy consumption by between 20% and 40% – the assembly stressed the significance of education, saying these changes should be voluntary rather than compulsory;    A “managed diversity” of land use, including steps such as restoring woodlands, peatlands and gorselands.  Assembly members highlighted the need for the above to be combined with measures to support farmers to make the transition, and ensure changes do not disproportionately affect the less well off. Assembly members said changes  20  Above: One of the speakers, Professor Paul Ekins from University College London, takes questions from assembly members.  should not compromise animal welfare, and expressed strong concerns about GM and lab grown food. They asked for policy-makers to take into account the implications for smaller farms, the suitability of different land for different uses, and differences in impact between UK regions.  conditional on low carbon practices and other public benefits, like protecting biodiversity (89%);   Paying farmers and other landowners to use their land to absorb and store carbon, for example by restoring peatland or planting trees (87%);    Amending the procedure for awarding government contracts to give preference to low carbon food producers (77%) and carbon storing products such as those from forestry (84%);    Changing planning rules so that food can be produced sustainably in a wider range of areas (83%);    Taxes and incentives for reducing food waste, for example to encourage shops to reduce waste; penalise food waste by businesses and individuals; and encourage supermarkets, restaurants and shops to serve smaller portion sizes (72%); Taxes and incentives for low carbon foods (66%).  How change should happen 3 Assembly members recommended policies to change both farming, food production and land use, and retail and individuals’ behaviour. At least two-thirds ‘agreed’ or ‘strongly agreed’ that nine policies should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. These were:   Labelling food and drink products to show the amount of emissions that come from different foods (94%);    Information and skills training for people who manage the land in order to encourage low carbon farming practices and reduce emissions (91%);    Low carbon farming regulations, for example, making farm payments  Full details of assembly members’ views on these policies can be found in Chapter 6.    Climate Assembly UK ― The path to net zero  21  What we buy The things we buy are linked to climate change because they use energy, and some of that energy comes from fossil fuels like oil, coal and gas. Products use energy while they are being made, through services we use when we buy them and because of how they reach us. Some products also need energy to run. When we then throw products away that has implications for climate change too. The UK has traditionally sent most of its waste to landfill sites. Some of this waste generates potent greenhouse gases as it rots.  Key recommendations Assembly members’ recommendations on ‘what we buy’ entail changes for businesses in particular, but also for individuals. Assembly members identified five areas as key: 1 Assembly members strongly supported a future in which businesses make products using less – and lower carbon – energy and materials. They backed a range of specific policies to support this aim, including ‘resource efficiency targets and standards’ (91%), an ‘amended procedure for awarding government contracts that gives preference to low carbon companies and products’ (83%), taxes on producers, products and services (83%), and ‘extended producer responsibility’ (79%). 2 Assembly members supported the idea of individuals repairing and sharing more, with less purchasing of new  Climate Assembly UK ― The path to net zero  products. They backed ‘measures to enable product sharing’ (77%) including technical and financial support to businesses who offer sharing or renting services. 3 Assembly members felt strongly about the need for better information to promote informed choice and changes in individual behaviour. They supported ‘labelling and information about the carbon emissions caused by different products and services’ (92%) and ‘product labelling and information campaigns about what can be recycled and why it’s important’ (92%). They also backed ‘advertising bans and restrictions’ on high emissions products or sectors (74%). 4 Assembly members supported a range of measures aimed at increasing recycling, including ‘deposit return schemes’ (86%), ‘increased doorstep recycling’ (85%), and ‘grants and incentives for businesses’ to improve recycling, develop new materials and make goods from recycled materials (77%). 5 Assembly members called for longterm commitment from government and Parliament. They emphasised the importance of cross-party support to prevent policies changing when governments change, as well as the need to look at both quick wins and long-term solutions.  22  Above: Assembly members listen to a speaker.  In addition to these five areas, some assembly members raised points for government and Parliament to consider around imports, ring-fencing any tax revenue generated by the above policies, and protecting consumers from increased costs. Some also highlighted trust and compliance issues relating to business, asking for transparency,  honesty, strong enforcement, and reliable and independent information and schemes. Assembly members did not support policies around changing income tax or working hours, personal carbon allowances, voluntary agreements, recycling requirements and payas-you-throw schemes.

The UK still produces a significant amount of its electricity from fossil fuels, particularly gas. This emits carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming and climate change. All the UK’s electricity generation will need to come from low carbon sources if it is to meet its net zero target. The UK is also likely to need more electricity in future due to an increase in electric vehicles and electric heating.  Key recommendations 1 Large majorities of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that three ways of generating electricity should be part of how the UK gets to net zero:   Offshore wind (95%);    Solar power (81%);    Onshore wind (78%).  Assembly members tended to see these technologies as proven, clean and low cost, with wind-based options suitable for a “windy” UK. Offshore wind had key additional benefits, particularly being “out of the way”. Solar power was viewed as flexible in terms of where it can be located, among other advantages.  Climate Assembly UK ― The path to net zero  Some assembly members suggested a range of points to bear in mind when implementing all three technologies. These included their location and environmental impact, progress on electricity storage, ways to incentivise and facilitate uptake, visual design, and where they are manufactured. 2 Assembly members were much less supportive of bioenergy, nuclear and fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage – although, particularly for bioenergy, significant numbers of assembly members were unsure about its use:   40% of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that bioenergy should be part of how the UK gets to net zero, 36% were ‘unsure’, and 24% ‘strongly disagreed’ or ‘disagreed’;    The equivalent figures for nuclear were 34%, 18% and 46%;    For fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage the results were 22%, 22% and 56%.  24  For some assembly members, their view on bioenergy would depend on how bioenergy is produced, including what is being burnt, how production is regulated, and therefore what its environmental and CO2 impacts are. Assembly members’ concerns about bioenergy included burning trees and crops, land use, environmental effects, and a feeling that better alternatives exist. Assembly members saw three main disadvantages to nuclear: its cost, safety, and issues around waste storage and decommissioning.  Above: A question and answer session is live-streamed online.  Their concerns about fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage centred on safety risks (if carbon leaked during storage or transfer), the continued use of fossil fuels, and a feeling that it only provides a “shortterm”, expensive solution when better alternatives are available.  3 Assembly members did not hear detailed evidence about tidal, wave, hydro and geothermal technologies. However, assembly members were in principle supportive of the use of these final four ways of generating electricity, particularly for suitable local areas.

Climate Assembly UK ― The path to net zero  25  Greenhouse gas removals Achieving the UK’s climate change target requires reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible. However reducing emissions alone will not be enough. By the middle of this century some emissions will still remain. For the themes considered by Climate Assembly UK, this is particularly true of air travel and farming. The assembly’s recommendations in these areas suggest remaining emissions by 2050 of between 45–55 million tonnes per year. The assembly therefore considered how best to remove these remaining emissions from the atmosphere.  Key recommendations Assembly members suggested that a combination of greenhouse gas removal methods will be needed to achieve the UK’s net zero target. 1 Assembly members recommended that four greenhouse gas removal methods should be part of how the UK gets to net zero:   Forests and better forest management (99%);13    Restoring and managing peatlands and wetlands (85%);    Using wood in construction (82%);    Enhancing the storage of carbon in the soil (62%).  Assembly members saw these methods as the most “natural” and as having significant co-benefits, including around preventing flooding and erosion, promoting biodiversity, access to nature and enjoyment. Assembly members also set out a number of conditions around their implementation, including that it is planned and managed well (for example, planting the right trees in the right places), support for farmers, sustainability, and the balance of land use. 2 Assembly members were less supportive of Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) and Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS). Only 42% of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that each of these methods should be part of how the UK gets to net zero, while 36% (BECCS) and 39% (DACCS) ‘strongly disagreed’ or ‘disagreed’. Common concerns about BECCS and DACCS included the potential for leaks from carbon storage sites and a feeling that they failed to address the problem, including a risk that they are “treated as [a] magic solution” that “takes the focus off the amount that we are emitting in the first place.” Assembly members also saw these  13 % assembly members who ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that this greenhouse gas removal method should be part of how the UK gets to net zero.

Some noted that these technologies could perhaps then be used more in the future or that they might be needed to “mop up” remaining CO2.  Whilst BECCS and DACCS received limited support, some assembly members are keen that further research and  Figure 5  How much do you agree or disagree that each of the following greenhouse gas removal methods should be part of how the UK gets to net zero?

At the request of both Parliament and assembly members themselves, space was made for consideration of the changed context for reaching net zero created by the pandemic, lockdown and their economic impacts.14 Assembly members’ views on this topic are significant. There is no other group that is at once representative of the UK population, and well-acquainted with the sorts of measures required to reach net zero.  Recovery 1 A large majority of assembly members (79%) ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that, ‘steps taken by the government to help the economy recover should be designed to help achieve net zero’. When giving their rationale, they most frequently recommended that the government:   Limit, or put conditions on, investment in high carbon industries;    Rethink and invest in infrastructure;    Support low carbon industries;    Make the most of the economic opportunities presented by the path to net zero;    Deal with Covid-19 and climate change together where possible;    Take advantage of the current opportunities for change.  Assembly members who were unsure or who disagreed with the statement tended to emphasise a need to focus on economic recovery first and foremost. 2 Another large majority of assembly members (93%) ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that, ‘as lockdown eases, government, employers and/or others should take steps to encourage lifestyles to change to be more compatible with reaching net zero’. Assembly members expressed support for encouraging homeworking and changes to how we travel, and again noted that this “tough and sad time” presents an opportunity for change. They also saw a key role for government in providing leadership and information, alongside roles for business and local areas.  14 The resulting session took place at the final assembly weekend on 16th May. At the time, strict lockdown measures were in place in all four UK nations.  Climate Assembly UK ― The path to net zero  28  Impact on the assembly’s thinking  assembly weekends two and three said that Covid-19 and lockdown had changed their thoughts and feelings about how to get to net zero in this area. They noted:  Assembly members tended to avoid expressing ‘strong’15 views about whether Covid-19 and the lockdown had made them think or feel differently about how the UK should get to net zero. In general their comments reflected the changed context created by Covid-19 rather than requests for alterations to specific recommendations. 3 Overall assembly members tended to agree that their thoughts and feelings about the path to net zero in general had changed (62%). They talked about a new sense of opportunity for change, and altered perceptions of what is possible (e.g. what government can do). They also noted lifestyle changes that are already happening. Some highlighted the economic impacts of the pandemic, suggesting, for example, that they make reaching net zero more difficult. 4 73% of the assembly members who had looked at ‘how we travel’ during    The changes happening to air travel, with some assembly members suggesting that people may continue to fly less;    Homeworking becoming more acceptable;    The impact on public transport, with people currently less willing to use it and questions about whether or not that will last long-term;    Increases in cycling and walking, although some questioned whether these would hold during the winter.  5 Only a minority of assembly members said that their thoughts and feelings had changed about the other assembly themes discussed prior to lockdown: ‘in the home’ (35%), ‘what we eat and how we use the land’ (36%), and ‘what we buy’ (36%).

Climate Assembly UK ― The path to net zero  29  Additional recommendations On the final assembly weekend, all assembly members discussed what further recommendations they wanted to make to Parliament and government. Assembly members worked together to draft suggested additions, which could be on any aspect of the path to net zero. The suggestions were then put to a vote of the whole assembly. Assembly members did not hear any new evidence to inform their votes. Their decisions were based on their own experiences, values, views and knowledge, and the information they had heard throughout the assembly. They had the option to abstain or choose ‘unsure’. In total, assembly members voted in favour of thirty-nine additional recommendations. They did not pass two further proposals. The recommendations touch on themes including: transparency, accountability and decision-making; education, communication and engagement; international action and impacts; and incentives, payments, conditions, and taxes.  Additional recommendations passed by the assembly For the full list and wording of each recommendation – some are detailed – please see Chapter 11. The ten recommendations that received most support were: 1 The transition to net zero should be a crosspolitical party issue, and not a partisan one (96% support16); 2 More transparency in the relationship between big energy companies and government (94% support); 3 Get to net zero without pushing our emissions to elsewhere in the world (92% support); 4 Incentives to accelerate progress to net zero and conditions attached for organisations seeking government financial support (91% support);  16 % of assembly members who ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ with the recommendation.  Climate Assembly UK ― The path to net zero  30  Above: Assembly members discuss the issues.  5 A robust media strategy on the outcomes of the Assembly (90% support); 6 An independent neutral body that that monitors and ensures progress to net zero, including citizens assemblies and independent experts (89% support); 7 Move away from fossil fuels and transition to new energy sources (89% support);  Proposals not passed by the assembly The assembly did not pass two proposals. Both focussed on reaching net zero by an earlier date than 2050. Slightly more assembly members opposed such a move than supported it, with the balance held by those who were ‘unsure’ or ‘didn’t mind.’  8 Products and services labelled to include their carbon footprint (89% support); 9 A follow up on the outcomes of the Assembly covering what has been taken into account, what hasn’t and why (88% support); 10 Harness the response to Covid-19 and COP26 to drive international coordinated action on climate change (87% support).

It was a once in a lifetime opportunity, and I am truly grateful to have been given the chance to take part.” Assembly member  Ch ap te r1  About Climate Assembly UK  In June 2019, the UK Government and Parliament agreed that the UK should do more to tackle climate change. They passed a law committing the UK to reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The target means that by 2050 the UK will have to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases it produces to a much lower level than today, and balance its remaining emissions by removing the same amount from the atmosphere. Decisions about how the target is reached will affect many aspects of people’s lives. It is against this backdrop that six select committees1 of the House of Commons decided to commission Climate Assembly UK2 – the first UK-wide citizens’ assembly on climate change. The committees asked the assembly to examine the question: “How should the UK meet its target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050?” The committees aim to use the assembly’s results to inform their work in scrunitising government. Climate Assembly UK has 108 members, who together are representative of the UK population in terms of both demographics and their level of concern about climate change (please see Section A below). They met as an assembly over six weekends between the end of January and the middle of May 2020. This report presents their recommendations – assembly members’ detailed and considered views on the path to net zero.  About this chapter and citizens’ assemblies Governments and parliaments around the world are increasingly using citizens’ assemblies in their work. The assemblies enable decision-makers to understand people’s informed and considered preferences on issues that are complex, controversial, moral or constitutional. The UK Parliament commissioned its first citizens’ assembly, the Citizens’ Assembly on Social Care, in 2018.  1 2  The six commissioning select committees were: Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy; Environmental Audit; Housing, Communities and Local Government; Science and Technology; Transport; and Treasury. The committees announced their plans for the assembly on 20 June 2019.  Climate Assembly UK ― About Climate Assembly UK  35  Citizens’ assemblies have a number of key features including:3   Who takes part: assembly members are representative of the wider population;    The assembly process: assembly members go through a three stage process of learning, discussion, and decision-making;    The information provided: the evidence presented to assembly members during the learning phase is balanced, accurate and comprehensive;    Independent facilitation: the assembly is not facilitated by the organisation that commissioned the assembly.  This chapter looks at how Climate Assembly UK worked across each of these areas. It also includes a brief introduction to how the assembly’s results are presented in the rest of this report.  A. Introducing the assembly members I felt like I’d won the lottery when I got the letter. I’d be daft not to do it – it’s amazing to “ get the chance to have a say and influence what may happen in the future. I was in the army for 22 years so I’ve not got a problem meeting new people and learning new things, I’m really looking forward to it. I hope Britain can take a leading role with making the changes we need to secure our future.” Assembly Member – Marc, 46, from Newcastle  Climate Assembly UK’s members come from all walks of life, and all across the UK – from Belfast to Bolton. They include parents, grandparents, and people without children; health workers, engineers, and full-time carers. At the time we first heard from them, the oldest was 79 years old; the youngest 16. None of them had ever met before. Together they are representative of the UK population in terms of:  3    Age;    Gender;    Ethnicity;    Educational level;    Where in the UK they live;    Whether they live in an urban or a rural area;    Their level of concern about climate change.

Climate Assembly UK ― About Climate Assembly UK  36  Above: Sir David Attenborough addresses Climate Assembly UK.4  The Sortition Foundation5 recruited assembly members using a process known as ‘sortition’ or a ‘civic lottery.’ Sortition is recognised internationally as the gold standard method for recruiting citizens’ assembly members. I am grateful to the 110 people from all corners of the United Kingdom who are giving up “ their weekends to take part in this very important discussion of how we in the UK reach our net zero emissions target. These people have been picked to represent our population as a whole, they come from all walks of life, and together they will deliberate carefully on behalf of us all. We should listen closely to their recommendations.” Sir David Attenborough, Naturalist & Broadcaster  A.1 How recruitment worked The recruitment process for assembly members had three stages.  Stage one – letters to a randomly selected households I was quite intrigued by the letter. To be asked for my opinion is unusual so it “ was certainly interesting.” Assembly member  4  5  Sir David did not give evidence to the assembly, instead he came to meet assembly members before dinner at the first assembly weekend. He thanked assembly members for giving up their time to be part of the assembly, and took questions about his life and work – but not about his views on the path to net zero. Please see Section D below.  Climate Assembly UK ― About Climate Assembly UK  37  The recruitment process started with Parliament sending out letters to addresses randomly selected from Royal Mail’s Postcode Address File: 80% of the addresses were randomly selected from the whole file; 20% from the most deprived areas within the file.6 The letters7 invited those aged 16 years or over, who are permanent UK residents8, living at an address that received a letter, to take part in the assembly.9 Recipients had the option to respond online or by phone to say that they were free on the relevant dates and would be interested in taking part.10 When they replied, we asked them a small number of demographic and attitudinal questions – those needed to be able to ensure that the assembly’s eventual membership was representative of the UK population across the seven criteria described above.  Stage two – random stratified sampling, done by computer I do hope there will be an opportunity for us all to meet up again. The Climate Assembly “ has been an extremely interesting and worthwhile experience for me and one which I feel very privileged to have participated in. Thank you computer!!!” Assembly member  Once the deadline for responses had passed, the Sortition Foundation used random stratified sampling by computer11 to generate a list of 110 people to become assembly members.12 The computer selected no more than one person from any single household. Sortition Foundation contacted these 110 individuals to let them know that they had been selected and to confirm their availability. They replaced anyone who dropped out at this stage, ensuring the assembly’s overall membership continued to be representative. They also contacted all other respondents to let them know they were on a reserve list and could be contacted if anyone withdrew before the first assembly weekend.  6  7  8 9  10 11 12  Responses to invitation letters can be lower from more deprived areas. Weighting where letters are sent in this way helps ensure that enough people from these areas respond for the assembly’s eventual make-up to be representative of the wider population. The invitation letter explained information including when the assembly would be held, the assembly’s remit, who had commissioned it, and what the commissioning committees would do with its results. It also covered information about the assembly team’s ability to meet different access needs and the support we could provide. We defined this as anyone that had stayed, or intended to stay, in the UK for a period of 12 months or more at the date on the invitation letter. The following people could not apply to be part of the assembly: Members of either Houses of the UK Parliament, the Welsh Parliament, the Scottish Parliament, or the Northern Ireland Assembly – and the staff of any of these Members; Local Authority Councillors; elected mayors; paid employees of any political party or of UK Parliament. We received positive responses from 1,748 people. This response rate of 5.8% is within the typical range for citizens’ assemblies in the UK (3–7%). The code for the selection is open source, and can be found on GitHub. Those who contributed to the code include Professor Ariel Procaccia and his team at Harvard University and Carnegie Mellon University. 105 assembly members were selected to be strictly representative of the UK population. The final five assembly members were used to over-sample groups that are either very small (meaning that an assembly member being ill for a weekend, for example, would leave them poorly represented) or which are more likely to drop out of the assembly process. For example, we slightly over-sampled people from Northern Ireland. Similarly, taken together, people in the attitudes to climate change poll who are ‘not at all’ or ‘not very concerned’ about climate change are slightly overrepresented (+3 people) amongst assembly members.  Climate Assembly UK ― About Climate Assembly UK  38  Above: Assembly members discuss the issues.  Stage three – liaison and final replacements I’m looking forward to taking part in the assembly and learning a lot more, “ and I think I have some great ideas to contribute.” Assembly Member – Maia, 44, from London  Involve, the public participation charity that would run the assembly weekends (please see Section D), took over contact with assembly members from this point. They focussed on ensuring that everyone had everything they needed ready for the first assembly weekend. This included providing any necessary support, for example with booking travel. A number of assembly members had to withdraw during this stage for a variety of personal reasons. Involve replaced these assembly members with people from the reserve list, ensuring that the assembly’s membership overall remained representative of the UK population.  Climate Assembly UK ― About Climate Assembly UK  39  A.2 The assembly’s make-up a bit worried that it would just be the people who were most passionate about the crisis “ –I was that you’d get an influx of people so it would be very one-sided and biased. So to come in and find it is a complete representation: I’ve spoken to people for who it’s a complete crisis – to complete denial or don’t believe it’s a real thing, that end of the spectrum. So to see that representation was quite a surprise and really refreshing for someone like myself.” Assembly member – Chris, 32, from Oxford  All but two of the 110 assembly members arrived at the Climate Assembly UK venue for the assembly’s first weekend. This made a total assembly membership of 108 people.13 The table below shows how these 108 assembly members compare to the UK population:  Criteria  UK population14 %  Assembly members %  No. of assembly members  16–29  21.7  23.1  25  30–44  23.9  25.9  28  45–59  25.0  24.1  26  60+  29.4  26.9  29  Age​  Data Source: ONS estimate mid-2018.

Assembly members’ attendance throughout the assembly remained high. Ill-health and other personal reasons occasionally meant that one or more assembly members missed a weekend.15 However this never had a significant effect on the percentages in the table above. Assembly members spent much of their time at the assembly working in small groups. We created seating plans to make sure there were a diverse range of assembly members at each table, in line with the seven recruitment criteria. We changed the seating plan every day during the offline weekends and for each session during the online weekends.  A.3 Access, inclusion and wellbeing Edd, Rebecca and the rest of the red [support] team you’ve made me feel so welcomed, “ relaxed and at ease on all three of the hotel weekends. You answered all of my queries, questions and emails no matter how trivial it may have been. You’ve all been so friendly and chatty. You’ve been with me every step of this whole experience, even when I’ve been tired and emotional. I stepped completely out of my comfort zone and [taking part] wouldn’t have been possible without all of you.” Assembly member  Access and inclusion were key considerations throughout the assembly.16 Prior to the first weekend, they influenced decisions such as our venue choice (a fully accessible venue), the venue’s location, and the timings of the events. We gave assembly members an honorarium of 15  16  One assembly member missed weekend two for health reasons. One (not the same person) missed weekend three for health reasons. When the assembly moved online due to coronavirus (please see Section B), two assembly members got in touch to tell us that they may have difficulty attending assembly sessions for Covid-19 related reasons. They asked to receive all the assembly information and said they would take part if they could. We aimed to facilitate their involvement by, for example, sharing speakers’ pre-recorded presentations with them to watch in their own time. Sadly, however, these two assembly members did not take part in the online weekends. One further assembly member, who had previously missed a weekend for health reasons, also did not take part. Two further assembly members missed the final assembly weekend for personal reasons. The final weekend therefore had the lowest attendance of any weekend, with 103 out of the 108 assembly members present. The measures described here are not an exhaustive list but they give an indication of the kinds of steps taken by the assembly team. We made it clear to assembly members that we could provide these, and other, types of support in the invitation letter. We also checked all assembly members’ needs and preferences during stage three of recruitment.  Climate Assembly UK ― About Climate Assembly UK  42  £150 per weekend17 for their participation, as well as covering their travel, accommodation and food/drink. Where relevant we covered costs such as childcare and the attendance of parents/ guardians. We paid all costs relating to assembly members bringing carers with them to the weekends. We also met other access needs by, for example, providing hearing loops, headsets and materials in large print. tone set by Involve was perfect. It was welcoming, open and yet firm and assertive. “ The It encouraged people to behave well and to take the assembly very seriously. It created an atmosphere of respect, co-operation, tolerance and humour. People from all walks of life were able to discuss and share with each other in a way they wouldn’t have managed in a different setting.” Assembly member  Access and inclusion remained key considerations at the assembly venue. In the first assembly session, assembly members drafted conversation guidelines for themselves. Examples included “respect others’ backgrounds and opinions”, “ensure everyone can participate”, “be calm and polite”, and “be honest and don’t be afraid to give your opinion.” The facilitators18 at the weekends helped to ensure that assembly members were mindful of the guidelines at all times. They also used facilitation techniques that helped ensure everyone had a voice. We worked with the Expert Leads and speakers (please see Section D) to make the information presented to assembly members as accessible and digestible as possible. We took a number of additional steps around access and inclusion when the assembly moved online due to Covid-19. These included minimising the amount of time assembly members, including those with young children, had to spend online at any one point, and ensuring that all assembly members had a way to participate in the sessions for free. We provided technical support and a guided chance to get to know the platforms we would be using. We provided flexible arrangements, where needed, for how and when assembly members could participate. were all so mindful of our needs and sympathetic to the different levels of “ They confidence we had. A particular mention of the ‘Quiet Room’ staff. I hadn’t expected to find this facility and was impressed that it had been thought of. I used it myself on a couple of occasions and found it to be an oasis of calm.” Assembly member  Another critical consideration was assembly members’ wellbeing.19 There was a support team both at and between weekends whose focus was to look after assembly members. We asked assembly members to fill out feedback forms at the end of every assembly weekend so that we could check for any issues. We also checked-in with each assembly member individually after each event to make sure all was well.  17  18 19  We advised assembly members receiving welfare benefits to check with their advisor about whether or not the honorarium would negatively affect them and, if yes, whether it would help if the honorarium was paid in vouchers for a shop of their choice. Assembly members could also choose to waive the honorarium entirely, although no one did. Some assembly members did choose to receive vouchers rather than bank transfers. There was a professional facilitator at each table, as well as at the front of the room. Again this list is not exhaustive, but it gives a flavour of the measures put in place.  Climate Assembly UK ― About Climate Assembly UK  43  At the assembly venue in Birmingham we created a designated Quiet Room, staffed by a trained member of the team. Assembly members could use it at any time if they were feeling unwell, distressed, in need of some space, or for any other reason. When the assembly moved online, we instead provided a phone number that assembly members could use to reach trained members of staff.  B. The assembly weekends The assembly was originally intended to run over four weekends in Birmingham, between the end of January and the end of March 2020. Three of these weekends happened as planned. The arrival of Covid-19 in the UK led to the fourth and final weekend being postponed and then moved online. It was disappointing that weekend four didn’t go ahead, but obviously we have to “ protect everybody’s health, so it was the right thing to do. I am glad that it is going forward in some capacity and I think that doing it virtually is the best way to do this.” Assembly member – Sharon, from Yorkshire  We split the intended content for the offline weekend four over three online weekends to ensure the assembly remained accessible (please see Section A.3 above).20 Following requests from assembly members, Parliament and the Expert Leads, we also added a session on the implications of Covid-19 for the path to net zero.21 The content of each weekend was as follows:  Weekend one Being here and seeing all these people, from all walks of life, representing the “ UK population, all so involved and willing to help make a change is really inspiring.” Assembly Member – Ibrahim, 42, from Surrey  All assembly members heard from, and questioned, three panels of speakers. The panels covered an introduction to climate change and the net zero target; and overarching ethical, practical and strategic questions about the path to net zero. Assembly members also reached their first decisions, on principles that should underpin the UK’s approach to meeting its climate target (please see Chapter 2).  20 21  Each weekend in Birmingham ran from Friday evening to Sunday lunchtime. The online weekends each had short sessions on Saturday morning, Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning. Please see Chapter 10 for the results of this session.  Climate Assembly UK ― About Climate Assembly UK  44  Weekend two  “ It’s an eye-opener all the new things I’m learning – incredible.” Assembly Member – Amanda, from Kent  On the Friday evening of weekend two, assembly members focussed on ways to consider the information they would receive throughout the assembly process.22 On Saturday morning, all assembly members heard an introduction to where our energy comes from, and questioned the speakers. The assembly then split into three groups to examine:   How we travel (please see Chapters 3 and 4);    Heat and energy use in the home (please see Chapter 5);    What we eat and how we use the land (please see Chapter 6) and What we buy (please see Chapter 7).  We divided assembly members into the three groups using random stratified sampling based on the seven recruitment criteria listed in Section A. This ensured each group remained representative of the UK population. Assembly members spent the remainder of weekend two in these groups, hearing evidence, questioning speakers and beginning to discuss what they had heard.  Weekend three “I feel like attitudes are constantly changing among who I’m sitting with and I’m enjoying it. Figuring out how we’re going to balance finance and technology and trying to grasp how we’re going to be able to fund these things but make sure things are getting done... It’s pretty special, especially as I’m only 21. It’s something I didn’t think I’d be able to get involved in, this early on. It’s going to have such a big impact on my future and hopefully, my children’s future so it’s really lovely to be asked to be involved in such a massive but valuable project.” Assembly Member – Ellie, 21, from Buckinghamshire  Weekend three started with a chance for assembly members to feed in their thoughts on the topics that their group had not considered at the previous weekend. We wrote these thoughts up overnight on the Friday and provided them to assembly members in the relevant groups on Saturday morning. Assembly members spent the rest of weekend three in their topic groups, discussing the evidence they had heard at weekend two and reaching their decisions on these issues.  22  Assembly members heard a short presentation on this topic from Dr Alan Renwick, (Constitution Unit, University College London). All speakers’ presentations are available as slides, videos and transcripts at climateassembly.uk/resources/.  Climate Assembly UK ― About Climate Assembly UK  45  Above: An assembly member takes notes.  Weekend four (online) online was another experience I had never had before. It worked really well. “ Going It was well organised and well done.” Assembly member  All assembly members spent weekend four focussed on the issue of ‘where our electricity comes from’ (please see Chapter 8). Assembly members heard from a panel of speakers on Saturday morning, questioned them on Saturday afternoon and discussed their views on Sunday morning. They made their final decisions by vote online, in a secure way, at the close of the weekend.  Weekend five (online) facilitation team has been amazing. They’ve kept us engaged and focused “ The throughout the weekends which can’t have been easy when your dealing with 110 opinionated human beings … and they’ve done it in a friendly and respectful way.” Assembly member  Weekend five followed the same format as weekend four, with all assembly members considering the topic of ‘removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere’ (please see Chapter 9).  Climate Assembly UK ― About Climate Assembly UK  46  Weekend six (online) of Climate Assembly UK I am proud that, despite the many challenges faced “ Asby ausmember all during the Covid-19 pandemic, we have still managed to finish the work needed to successfully provide the six select committees with proposals to meet the target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. I hope Parliament will take time to consider these proposals with due care and respect.” Assembly member – Adrian, 52, from Northern Ireland  Weekend six was split into three parts:   On Saturday morning, all assembly members considered early drafts of sections of the assembly report, and provided feedback on them;    On Saturday afternoon, all assembly members explored the implications of Covid-19 for the path to net zero (please see Chapter 10). They voted on some questions around this topic online at the end of the day;    On Sunday morning, all assembly members discussed whether there were any additional recommendations that they wanted to add to the report (please see Chapter 11). Again, decisions on this area were made by vote online.  Assembly members continued to provide feedback on drafts of this report, and on the assembly’s interim briefing released in June 2020,23 after the end of weekend six.  How the assembly reached its decisions Assembly members learnt about each topic they considered and discussed them in-depth. They then made their decisions. This decision-making phase took two different forms:   Sometimes assembly members drafted options to vote on themselves, in an entirely bottom-up process;    Sometimes they voted on pre-prepared options, occasionally modifying these in advance of the vote.24  Citizens’ assemblies often primarily use the first kind of entirely bottom-up decision-making process. Climate Assembly UK supplemented this with votes on scenarios and options for a number of reasons:   The target – it provided a guide to assembly members about how to construct packages of recommendations across the ten themes that together were capable of achieving net zero by 2050;    Key trade offs – it meant that the assembly was able to explore and explicitly take a view on the key options and trade-offs facing decision-makers;  23 24  The assembly released its key recommendations on ‘Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero’ in June 2020, in advance of government announcements on this issue. The Expert Leads also used assembly members’ comments at previous weekends to help shape the options.  Climate Assembly UK ― About Climate Assembly UK  47  Time – it enabled the assembly to cover a broader range of topics and issues in the time    available to it. The process for deciding on the options and scenarios used at the assembly was the same as the one for ensuring the information assembly members heard was balanced, accurate and comprehensive (please see Section C of this chapter). Which decision-making process was used for which decisions is described clearly throughout this report.  C. Balanced, accurate and comprehensive information The assembly team worked hard to ensure that the information presented to assembly members was balanced, accurate and comprehensive.  The Expert Leads This work started with the assembly’s Expert Leads: Chris Stark, Committee on Climate Change; Professor Jim Watson, University College London; Professor Lorraine Whitmarsh, University of Bath; and Professor Rebecca Willis, University of Lancaster.25 The role of the Experts Leads was to ensure that Climate Assembly UK was:   Balanced, accurate and comprehensive in terms of its content on climate change;    Focussed on the key decisions facing the UK about how to get to net zero by 2050.  They worked closely with Involve (please see Section D below) to draft the assembly’s structure, including the themes it would consider, and the focus of each panel of speakers. They also drafted briefs for each speaker slot on each panel, and suggested names of speakers against each brief. The Expert Leads all attended the assembly weekends as speakers and to provide balanced answers to questions that arose during assembly members’ discussions. They were supported in this role by Jenny Hill, Committee on Climate Change, and Professor Jillian Anable, University of Leeds.  25  Involve (please see Section D) contacted the Expert Leads to ask if they would be interested in principle in being involved before submitting a proposal for Parliament’s tender for contract. The team at Parliament working on Climate Assembly UK approved these individuals as the assembly’s Expert Leads when awarding the contract, on the basis of their clear expertise in addressing climate change.

Minutes of Advisory Panel meetings are published on the Climate Assembly UK website. Advisory Panel members also commented on all written briefings provided to assembly members.  26  27  Advisory Panel members were chosen to represent stakeholders with an interest or expertise in the areas of emissions reduction that Parliament and the Expert Leads felt Climate Assembly UK should examine. The organisations were chosen to make the panel balanced across a broad range of political and ideological standpoints, representing different parts of society (e.g. business, trade unions, NGOs and civil society groups). A climate change specialist in the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology (POST) drew up an initial list of members. The Climate Assembly UK team at Parliament then worked with the Expert Leads to ensure that this group met the above criteria. Chaitanya has since changed roles but was at Green Alliance at the point when Advisory Panel meetings took place.

Academic panel members also commented on written briefings provided to assembly members within their respective areas of specialism.  Wider society Climate Assembly UK is grateful for the engagement and input of a number of prominent business, faith and civil society leaders from across UK society. These individuals received a briefing on Climate Assembly UK in December 2019 and had the opportunity to provide comments:  28    Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, Director-General, CBI    Joanna Haigh CBE FRS, Emeritus Professor of atmospheric physics and recent co-director of the Grantham Institute on climate change at Imperial College London  Academic Panel members were chosen on the basis of their expertise on areas of climate change that Parliament and the Expert Leads felt Climate Assembly UK should examine. A climate change specialist in the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology (POST) drew up an initial list of members.

These individuals have considerable experience of putting together balanced panels and evidence for Members of Parliament and select committees.  29  Parliamentary officials were also able to input to all aspects of the assembly’s plans at earlier stages in their development.  Climate Assembly UK ― About Climate Assembly UK  51  Speakers The assembly’s final design included presentations from forty-seven speakers, including the Expert Leads. Some speakers were asked to act as ‘informants’, meaning they needed to cover the range of views and available evidence on a topic. Others were asked to be ‘advocates’, giving their own view or that of their organisation. At the start of each chapter we have included in a footnote a list of the speakers who presented on that topic and noted whether they were advocates or informants. We also gave assembly members this information before they heard from the relevant individuals. In addition to the forty-seven speakers, and the opportunity to hear from Sir David Attenborough, Chairs of two of the commissioning select committees – Rachel Reeves MP,30 and Mel Stride MP – addressed the assembly. They thanked assembly members for taking part and explained why they see Climate Assembly UK as important. A full list of speakers, including the two MPs, can be found on the Climate Assembly UK website.  Transparency Transparency was a key consideration for the Climate Assembly UK team. The Climate Assembly UK website (www.climateassembly.uk) contains information including:   Videos of all speakers’ presentations to the assembly, along with their slides and transcripts of what they said;    Videos of question and answer sessions with speakers that took place in plenary, along with transcripts of those sessions;    All written briefings given to assembly members;    Full lists of the assembly’s Expert Leads, Advisory Panel members, Academic Panel members and the organisations involved in delivering the assembly, along with minutes of Advisory Panel meetings.  We live-streamed all speaker presentations to the assembly online. We also opened the assembly to a wide range of media, stakeholders, officials and politicians so that they could observe the assembly’s proceedings. We were careful to balance our wish for complete transparency against the need to protect assembly members’ identities. Assembly members all had a choice about whether or not to take part in media interviews, photos and audio/video footage of the assembly. It was also their decision whether or not to reveal their identity on social media.  30  Rachel Reeves MP has since left her role as a committee chair to become Shadow Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office.

The delivery team and funding After a competitive tendering process, in September 2019 Parliament awarded a contract for the delivery of Climate Assembly UK to:   The Involve Foundation (‘Involve’) – a public participation charity, whose vision is of a vibrant democracy with people at the heart of decision-making. Involve was responsible for ensuring that Climate Assembly UK was a high quality citizens’ assembly. It also recruited and led the facilitation team for the assembly and managed the project overall. It was the main point of contact for assembly members. www.involve.org.uk    Sortition Foundation – a not-for-profit company that promotes the use of randomly selected groups of people in decision-making. Sortition Foundation was responsible for recruiting assembly members. www.sortitionfoundation.org    mySociety – a not-for-profit social enterprise that provides technology, research and data that help people to be active citizens. It was responsible for Climate Assembly UK’s branding and website. www.mysociety.org  Climate Assembly UK was funded by the House of Commons, with additional funding from two philanthropic organisations: the Esmée Fairbairn Foundation and the European Climate Foundation.31 The two philanthropic organisations did not have a say in how the assembly was run or what it covered. The Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit worked with Parliament to support communications outreach around the Climate Assembly UK weekends and results. www.eciu.net  31  The House of Commons provided £120,000 in funding. The Esmée Fairbairn Foundation and the European Climate Foundation contributed a further £200,000 each, rising to £220,000 each to help cover the additional costs incurred due to Covid-19.  Climate Assembly UK ― About Climate Assembly UK  53  E. Assembly members’ views of the assembly An independent evaluation of Climate Assembly UK will be published in Spring 2021. However, initial results suggest that assembly members viewed the assembly very positively: Statement about the assembly, from the survey completed by assembly members after all six weekends  % assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’  % assembly members ‘don’t know / unsure’  % assembly members ‘strongly disagreed’ or ‘disagreed’  ‘I have understood almost everything that the other members of my small group said during our discussions’  98  1  1  ‘I have understood almost everything that was presented by the speakers’  95  4  1  ‘I have had enough information to participate effectively’  91  5  4  ‘The information I have received has been fair and balanced between different view points’  78  16  6  ‘The assembly has helped me clarify my views about how to reach net zero’  96  1  3  ‘I have learned a lot during the assembly about how UK can achieve net zero by 2050’  95  3  2  ‘My fellow participants have respected what I had to say, even when they didn’t agree with me’  94  5  0  ‘I have had ample opportunity in the small group discussions to express my views’  95  2  3  ‘Assemblies like this should be used more often to inform government and parliament decision-making’  90  7  3  Climate Assembly UK ― About Climate Assembly UK  54  The interim results also suggest that taking part in the assembly has impacted positively on assembly members’ appetite and confidence to engage in political decision-making. 88% of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that they ‘feel more confident to engage in political decision-making as a result of being involved in this citizens’ assembly.’ The same percentage ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that ‘taking part in this citizens’ assembly has made me want to be more involved in other aspects of decision-making.’ Like everyone else, I really enjoyed the entire experience, and I am sorry that it has now “ come to an end.  It was a once in a lifetime opportunity, and I am truly grateful to have been given the chance to take part.” Assembly member  about climate change is as high as ever, and it’s clear we all need to play our “ Concern part to achieve the net zero emissions target that was passed into UK law by Parliament last year. This is why I welcome the work of Climate Assembly UK, a great example of parliamentarians engaging with the public to help influence their work and proposals for action. I am very grateful to the assembly members for their time. I look forward to hearing the outcome of their discussions – and to chairing House of Commons debates on a topic that is so relevant to us all.” Right Honourable Sir Lindsay Hoyle, Speaker of the House of Commons  The rest of this report recounts the assembly’s detailed and considered view of its recommended path to net zero by 2050. Taken together the recommendations provide a internally consistent and coherent vision, and are designed to be considered as a whole.  Climate Assembly UK ― About Climate Assembly UK  55  Ch ap te r  2  Underpinning principles  Assembly members’ first decision focussed on the principles that should underpin the UK’s path to net zero. They agreed twenty-five underpinning principles, then used a vote to prioritise them. The principles form part of the assembly’s recommendations to government and Parliament. Assembly members also used them to inform their own work.  What did the assembly consider? All assembly members took part in the discussions about underpinning principles, which took place at the first assembly weekend. They drew on their own experiences, values and views, as well as evidence from the assembly’s first three panels of speakers.1These panels covered an introduction to climate change, and different perspectives on overarching ethical, practical and strategic questions about the path to net zero. All the speakers gave presentations to the assembly and were then questioned by its members.  How did the assembly reach its decisions? Assembly members began their decision-making process after the first two panels of speakers. They started by considering individually how they would finish the sentence: “The UK’s path to net zero by 2050 should be underpinned by the principles of….” They then discussed their views in small groups at their tables, with each table agreeing their four priority responses. These responses had to, between them, represent the range of opinions at the table. While assembly members listened to and questioned the third panel of speakers, facilitators took these responses and grouped similar ideas together to form a draft  1  The assembly heard from nine speakers across its first three panels: Professor Joanna Haigh, Imperial College London (informant); Professor Ed Hawkins, University of Reading (informant); Professor Rebecca Willis, University of Lancaster (informant); Chris Stark, Committee on Climate Change (informant); Fernanda Balata, New Economics Foundation (advocate); Professor Paul Ekins, University College London (advocate); Modi Mwatsama, Wellcome (advocate); Tony Juniper, Natural England (advocate); Kirsten Leggatt, 2050 Climate Group (advocate). All speakers’ presentations are available as slides, videos and transcripts at climateassembly.uk/resources/. An ‘informant’ is a speaker who we asked to cover the range of views and available evidence on a topic. An ‘advocate’ is a speaker who we asked to give their own view, or the view of their organisation. Assembly members knew whether speakers were informants or advocates.

They presented the draft back to assembly members, who had the opportunity to note any omissions or suggest changes. Facilitators then made these amends. Tables also discussed and added additional ideas based on the evidence they heard from Panel Three. The final ballot paper included twenty-five principles that assembly members believe should underpin the path to net zero.  Prioritised principles The vote asked assembly members to prioritise the twenty-five principles that they had developed. Each assembly member could vote for the eight options that they saw as the highest priority. It is important to note that the results of the vote therefore show priorities not levels of support. A lack of votes does not necessarily signal that assembly members disagreed with an idea, just that they saw it as less important. The results of the vote were as follows.  Principles prioritised by over half of all assembly members 1.  Informing and educating everyone (the public, industry, individuals and government) – 74 votes  2.  Fairness within the UK, including for the most vulnerable (affordability, jobs, UK regions, incentives and rewards) in actions, not just words – 65 votes  3.  Leadership from government that is clear, proactive, accountable and consistent (cross-party consenus) – 63 votes  4.  Protecting and restoring the natural world – 59 votes  Principles prioritised by over a third of all assembly members 5.  Ensuring solutions are future-proofed and sustainable for the future – 45 votes  6.  A joined up approach across the system and all levels of society (working together, collaborating, and sharing) – 40 votes  7.  Long-term planning and a phased transition – 39 votes  8.  Urgency – 37 votes  9.  Support for sustainable growth (including pioneering innovation) – 37 votes  Additional principles agreed by the assembly 10. Local community engagement embedded in national solutions – 33 votes 11.

Enabling and not restricting individual choice – 23 votes 22. Protect the UK economy, including from global competition – 18 votes 23. Compromise about changing lifestyles – 15 votes 24. Those who bear the most responsibility should act – 13 votes 25. Not negatively impacting other institutions – 4 votes  The top nine principles – those prioritised by over a third of assembly members – were displayed in the assembly rooms throughout the remaining weekends. We also gave assembly members hard copies of the full vote results to refer to during their discussions. Assembly members returned to these principles, and considerations related to them, throughout the rest of the assembly.

These included that solutions must be accessible and affordable to all sections of society, the need to “help create massive change at an individual level”, and a wish for cross-party action. 2 Assembly members aimed to minimise restrictions on travel and lifestyles, placing the emphasis on shifting to electric vehicles and improving public transport, rather than on large reductions in car use. 3 Assembly members recommended a future for surface transport in the UK that includes:   A ban on the sale of new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars by 2030–2035;    A reduction in the amount we use cars by an average of 2–5% per decade;    Improved public transport.  4 In terms of how the UK should make these changes, assembly members recommended a wide range of policies aimed at moving quickly to low carbon vehicles, increasing the use of public and active transport, and discouraging car ownership and use. These included:  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land    Government investment in low carbon buses and trains;    Quickly stop selling the most polluting vehicles;    Adding new bus routes and more frequent services;    Making public transport cheaper;    Bringing public transport back under government control;    Grants for businesses and people to buy low carbon cars;    Localisation;    Investing in cycling and scootering facilities;    Increasing investment to make buses faster and more reliable;    Car scrappage scheme.  5 As well as the wish to minimise restrictions on lifestyles, assembly members’ rationale for their decisions included points around the speed of change, feasibility, practicalities, cost (both personal and overall), and co-benefits such as improved air quality, reduced congestion and impacts on local areas and high streets. Assembly members consistently raised the importance of accessibility and affordability, stressing the need to avoid negative consequences for rural areas, mental health and isolation, people with a disability, and those on low incomes.  61  How we travel on land The ways we travel on land are collectively known as ‘surface transport’. Surface transport includes cars, vans and lorries, as well as public transport like buses, coaches and trains. It also includes ‘active transport’ – for example, when we walk, cycle or scoot. Surface transport accounts for 70% of the UK’s total greenhouse gas emissions from transport1 and 23% of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions overall.2 Most of these emissions come from cars, with just 5% arising from public transport.  Figure 1  Proportion of greenhouse gases from each type of surface transport (2017)3  59% Cars 3% Buses and coaches 2% Rail 1% Other 17% Vans 18% Heavy goods vehicles  Surface transport includes both passenger or ‘personal’ transport, and freight. Personal transport is what people use to travel for pleasure, for everyday activities (like going shopping)  1 2 3  With the rest made up of air travel (22%) and sea travel (8%).

Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  62  and for almost all work. Freight is transport used to move goods. It includes goods for everything, including farming, industry, shops and online shopping deliveries. It also includes transport used for services, for example the vans used by decorators, plumbers or to deliver the post. Climate Assembly UK considered personal transport only. It did not look at freight. This followed guidance from Parliament that, if there was not time to consider both, its committees most wanted to hear assembly members’ views on personal transport. Personal surface transport accounts for 15% of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions overall.  What did the assembly consider? Thirty-six assembly members considered the topic of surface transport in-depth. We selected these assembly members from the assembly as a whole using random stratified sampling. This ensured that they remained reflective of the wider UK population in terms of both demographics4 and their level of concern about climate change. These assembly members heard a wide range of views both on what the future of surface transport could look like for the UK, and how we might move towards that future. They had the opportunity to question each speaker5 in detail. These evidence sessions took place at weekend two of the assembly. Assembly members spent weekend three of the assembly discussing the evidence they had heard and their own views in-depth, before reaching conclusions on three separate areas: A.  Considerations: the overarching considerations that government and Parliament should bear in mind when making decisions about surface transport and the path to net zero;  B.  Futures: what the future of surface transport in the UK should look like;  C.  Policy options: how the UK should move toward this future.  Assembly members also had the opportunity to discuss and add anything else they wanted to say to government and Parliament about surface transport and the path to net zero. Assembly members’ views on the implications of Covid-19 for this topic are touched on in Chapter 10.  4 5  Age, gender, ethnicity, educational qualification, where in the UK they live and whether they live in an urban or rural area. The assembly heard from six speakers on surface transport: Professor Jillian Anable, University of Leeds (informant); Ellie Davies, Committee on Climate Change (informant); Lynn Sloman, Transport for Quality of Life (informant); Jason Torrance, UK100 (informant); Steve Melia, University of West England (advocate); John Siraut, Jacobs (advocate). All speakers’ presentations are available as slides, videos and transcripts at climateassembly.uk/resources/. An ‘informant’ is a speaker who we asked to cover the range of views and available evidence on a topic. An ‘advocate’ is a speaker who we asked to give their own view, or the view of their organisation. Assembly members knew whether speakers were informants or advocates.

Considerations Assembly members reached their first decisions on surface transport by discussing their answers to the following question: What considerations should government and Parliament bear in mind when making decisions about surface transport and the path to net zero? Assembly members thought about their answers to this question individually. They then discussed their views in small groups, with each table agreeing their five top considerations. These top considerations had to, between them, represent the range of views at the table. Facilitators took the top considerations from each table and grouped similar options together to create a list on which assembly members could vote. They checked this list back with assembly members to make sure they had accurately reflected their views. This included making any necessary adjustments. Each assembly member could then vote for the four options that they felt to be most important. The results were as follows. The wording of the considerations in the table is either word for word what assembly members wrote on their option cards or, where facilitators combined similar options from several tables, how we described the options to assembly members prior to the vote. Where applicable, we have also included in italics further detail on what assembly members wrote on their option cards.

However it is possible that individual assembly members voted for more than one option within this group, which is why we have treated them separately.  B. Futures After deciding on their most important considerations, assembly members moved on to look at what the future of surface transport should be for the UK. To aid them in this process, the Expert Leads presented assembly members with three scenarios: 1.  Fast action to change the cars we drive;  2.  Changing the cars we drive and how much we use them;  3.  Reducing the amount travelled across all transport types.  Together these scenarios covered a broad range of views about what could happen to surface transport to help the UK meet its 2050 net zero target. Assembly members discussed each of the scenarios or ‘possible futures’ in turn, before voting on them by secret ballot. We start by presenting the rationale for their views, taking each possible future in turn.  Jump to the vote results on page 75  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  66  B.1 Fast action to change the cars we drive The emphasis of this possible future was on changing the types of car that we drive. It would involve:   Banning the sale of new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars by 2030;    Quickly stopping the sale of the most polluting vehicles, for example some SUVs;    Reducing the amount we use cars by about 2% per decade, for example stopping car use in the centre of large urban areas;    Faster uptake of electric buses and trains;    Strictly limiting new road building until virtually all petrol, diesel and hybrid cars are gone from the roads (around 2045).  Assembly members discussed this possible future in small groups. They identified the following pros and cons.  Pros + Doesn’t require reduced car use – some assembly members liked that you “do not have to reduce car use”, or that this option involves “less car use reduction than other options – so people get to keep their (beloved) cars.” + Less authoritarian – some assembly members felt that this option involved “fewer restrictions on individuals”, or described it as the “least authoritarian route to reductions.” + Impactful and quick – some assembly members said there would be “guaranteed change – through legislation” or “fast, decisive action that will make an immediate impact.” Others said we would “reach [the] target of net zero sooner”, or that this was the “quickest way to effectuate change.” + Co-benefits including air quality – some assembly members suggested that this future would bring “benefits for all: e.g. air quality, saving money on new roads, car running costs reduce.” Others suggested that there would be “air quality improvement in city centres”, that “air quality will improve quickly”, or that “in society change is possible to make [a] cleaner/ pleasant atmosphere, starting with active transport.” + Stopping selling the most polluting vehicles –some assembly members said they supported “stop[ping] selling the most polluting vehicles” including because they “will encourage greener choices.” + No road building – some assembly members said that the “ban [on] road building is positive” or that “not building new roads would save money that could be spent on greener solutions.” + Better and more used public transport – some assembly members said that “making cars more expensive should help [the] push on fixing public transport” or that “no cars in [the] city centre [would]… encourage public transport.” + Electric public transport – some assembly members liked the idea of “more electric trains and buses”, or a “faster uptake on [electric] buses and trains.”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  67  + Feasible – some assembly members described this future as “feasible – more achievable”, or said that “no more car use in city centres is cost effective and can be done tomorrow.” + “Shot in the arm for car industry” + “The running costs [of cars] will be improved with electric cars” + “Allows people time to adjust to changes”  Cons − Price, affordability and rural areas – some assembly members suggested that the “price[s] [of electric cars] would need to be more realistic than they are now” or worried about “affordability – being forced to upgrade your car before you need to.” Others asked “how/what to buy if [you] need a car in 2025? Electric car probably too expensive?” Some assembly members expressed concerns that if it’s “more expensive to travel by car, people in rural areas may be penalised.” − Congestion – some assembly members suggested it would “not solve [the] problem of congestion” or that “there would be just as many cars on the road”. Others commented “don’t like banning road building – concern will result in more congestion.” − Feasibility and readiness – some assembly members questioned “is it technically feasible (2030 is only 10 years away)?”, or “will EV infrastructure be there?”to.” Others said the “infrastructure [is] not ready yet.” or stated that their support was conditional on ‘charging infrastructure …[being] in place.” − Job losses – some assembly members asked “what would happen to petrol stations and the jobs they create?” or said “not building roads will impact jobs and also mean regional poverty (southeast only benefit).” Some others questioned the “time frame”, suggesting it was “very soon” and would result in “job loss.”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  68  − Banning hybrids – some assembly members disliked “banning hybrids” or asked “why are petrol, diesel and hybrid grouped together? They are different.” − Scrapping cars – some assembly members asked “is it fair to scrap cars early, if people have just bought them?” or suggested there might be problems “managing high volumes of scrapped cars.” − Fewer benefits – some assembly members said there would be “no urban improvement which has [positive] effects on health which should be [a] priority!” or that there would be “no benefit for non-car users, no improvement in public transport.” − “Quickly stop selling most polluting vehicles – reduction in choice” − “Demonised for driving classic cars and motorbikes” − “Need to build electric rail to compensate for no road building” − “Shuts down consideration of alternative fuels option” − “Overall eventual footprint worse because of EV production” − “Not enough solutions to replace petrol, diesel and hybrid cars (electric cars)”  Some assembly members attached conditions to their support for this possible future, suggesting that:   “Renewable energy sources [would need to be] in place”;    “Government fleets should be converted first as an example of leadership (charging point at No. 10).” Other assembly members stated more generally that “all [car] fleets should be converted”;    We should “star[t] with active transport.”  When we asked assembly members to rank the possible futures in their order of preference, this scenario received significant support from assembly members. Please see below for the results of the vote.  B.2 Changing the cars we drive and how much we use them This scenario would involve a combination of changing the types of car that we drive and reducing the amount we drive. It would include:   Banning the sale of new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars by 2032–2035;    Reducing the amount we use cars by an average of 5% per decade, meaning for example that only half the people who drove to work pre Covid-19 would be able to do so;    One or more of: —  Improving public and active transport (e.g. trains, buses, cycling, e-biking, walking);  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  69    —  Helping people to travel shorter distances by planning the location of houses and shops etc better;  —  Making it more expensive to travel by car compared to other transport types;  Strictly limiting new road building until virtually all petrol, diesel and hybrid cars were gone from the roads (around 2050)  Assembly members discussed this possible future in small groups. They identified the following pros and cons.  Pros + Public and active transport – some assembly members liked the idea of “improved public transport” or suggested there would be “improvement in quality of life by improving public transport.” Others backed “increasing active travel” or a “focus on expanding correct infrastructure / creating new infrastructure to include options for cyclists and walkers.” Some said more generally that this future “considers options for non-car users.” + Air quality, pollution and health – some assembly members cited the “health benefits from active travel, air quality improvement, [and] better urban environments”, with some stating that “all health will improve.” Some noted “air quality improvement” specifically, or suggested that electric cars would resolve problems caused by people not turning their engines off at traffic lights. + Support for localisation – some assembly members said this future would “benefit [the] localisation of services” or “improve local shopping.” Others noted that “new estates do not have local amenities (shops/doctors etc) so you are forced to use [a] car – [they] need better public services.” + Longer until ban – some assembly members said that the ban on petrol, diesel and hybrid cars was “not completely straightaway reducing people’s options – good option for car users” or that there was a “longer time to adapt to change.” + Encouraging behaviour change – some assembly members said it would “encourage a behaviour change” or “encourage choosing EV so [as] not to be penalised.” Others suggested that “making it [car use] more expensive will make people travel by public transport to save money” or that “reducing car use by 5% will improve use of public greener transport.” + Emissions reduction – some assembly members liked that it would “reduce CO2 use” or said the “reduction in emissions begins earlier.” + Feasibility – some assembly members liked the “realism – e.g. 5%” or suggested that “no more car use in city centres [is] easy to do, cost effective and can be done tomorrow.” + “Greater sense of personal choice – more choice in how you make specific journeys e.g. car/public transport/cycle” + “Planning – better town centre” + “Reduction of cars should result in quieter roads – making it easier to get around” + “Strictly limiting sale of petrol, diesel and can help the new industry to fund/fix new tech”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  70  Cons − Unachievable – some assembly members suggested that “changing ingrained behaviour is very hard” or asked, “how do we know [a] 5% reduction is achievable?”. Others asked “banning – is 2032/2035 realistic” or said “people will continue to buy second hand petrol/ diesel cars – they will be cheaper than buying a new electric car within the 2032–2035 period.” Some assembly members felt that “improving public transport will not stop people driving their own cars” or said they were “sceptical that public transport [would be] good enough to reduce car use by 5%.” − Increased costs, including for particular groups – some assembly members disliked “making it more expensive to travel by car ”, suggesting that it “penalises car users by increasing costs to them [when an] increase in green solutions shouldn’t take choices away from them (independence).” Some assembly members worried increased costs “may price people out of essential travel”, with some particularly noting the “impact on disabled [people] of increased costs.” Others said it is “not practical to increase cost… Rural areas need to drive to health centre – school etc.” Some assembly members asked “how much price change increase [is] needed to change behaviour – big stick.” − Lifestyles and flexibility – some assembly members said it would “make it harder for people to live as they do today”, or noted that people would “have to change their transport.” Others questioned whether “people really mak[e] journeys now that they consider unnecessary?“ or worried that “not driving to work takes away flexibility e.g. if child is ill.” − Banning road building – some assembly members said “limiting new road build[ing] will have [a] negative effect on rural/non-accessible areas” or would result in “increased congestion; reduced growth; poorer quality of life.” − “Will lead to more carbon emissions lasting longer – because diesel and petrol on the road longer” − “Particulate emissions from EV – still an issue” − “Where do we find the £28 billion generated by fuel tax?” − “What happens to [e.g.] Ikea deliveries?”  Some assembly members noted conditions to their support for this future, stating that:   “Public transport [in rural areas] would need to be as good as city transport”;    It would have to be “easier to bring shopping back by public transport”;    There would need to be “new estates planned”;    They would want the ban on petrol, diesel and hybrid cars to be 2032 not 2035.  When we asked assembly members to rank the possible futures in their order of preference, this scenario received significant support from assembly members. Please see below for the results of the vote.  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  71  B.3 Reducing the amount travelled across all transport types This scenario places the emphasis on reducing the total amount we travel, including significant reductions in car use. It would involve:   Leaving the phase out of petrol, diesel and hybrid cars and buses to happen naturally as car companies start to offer electric cars into the marketplace;    The option to introduce a ban on sales of petrol, diesel and hybrid cars later if the sale of electric cars is too slow;    Reducing car use by an average of 10% per decade, meaning for example that less than half of those driving to work pre Covid-19 would be able to do so and double the number of people would need to holiday by train instead of by car;    All of:    —  Improving public and active transport (e.g. trains, buses, cycling, e-biking, walking);  —  Helping people to travel shorter distances by planning the location of houses and shops etc better;  —  Making it more expensive to travel by car compared to other transport types;  No building roads until virtually all petrol, diesel and hybrid cars are gone from the roads (around 2050)  Assembly members discussed this possible future in small groups. They identified the following pros and cons.  Pros + Localisation – some assembly members liked the “local community focus” or the idea of “services available locally”, suggesting there would be “better local planning and amenities” or “more local services improved.” Some felt it would lead to “more mobile services (e.g. medical services).” Others said localisation would mean “more leisure time as less travel time.” + Improved public and active transport – some assembly members liked the idea of “improving public transport”, or an “improvement of public transport and cycling routes.” Others said “a big investment in electric public transportation benefits communities.” + Behaviour change and a greater range of options – some assembly members stated that “much improved public transport, car sharing, cycling and walking means less need to own a car.” Others suggested there would be “positive behavioural change” or said the scenario included “many options to reduce car use e.g. public transport, shorter distances to shops.” Some said it “reduces the need for any kind of transport [beyond walking].” + Co-benefits – some assembly members suggested that “with public transport you will interact more and meet people” or that there would be “health benefits – mental.” Others felt there would be “less congestion overall, more open spaces” or noted we would be “reducing polluting car use by 10% per decade.”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  72  + Flexibility of approach – some assembly members said that they “like the idea of delaying the ban on petrol and diesel but [with the] option to use [a ban later] if needed.” Some said the approach had “more flexibility... in case electric vehicle development does not progress as expected.” + Time for technology to develop – some assembly members said the fact there was “no date to stop sales of new cars, allows time for technology to develop replacements” or stated the “ban is later – more time for technology to develop.” + “Increase of jobs in businesses” + “Phase out of cars would be easier for people to accept” + “Less fuel dependency on Middle East”  Cons − Impact on quality of life, particularly for certain groups – some assembly members said this option “may increase isolation and loneliness”, worried about the “impact of increased costs on rural and disabled communities” or said it would lead to “reduced mobility, poorer life aspirations [and a] poorer standard of life.” Others talked about the “social impact on mental health” or noted that “travel has mental health and psychology benefits.” Some labelled the scenario “oppressive”, suggesting that “the impact of road closures would affect people disproportionately.” − Restricted choice – some assembly said it would “take choice away from consumers”, or “force people to reduce their travel options.” Others disliked “restrictions on travel – because they are looking at reducing travel on all transport (you can only go so far on a bike).” Some suggested that “many people will not want [a] decrease in car use, on only pollution.” − Lack of emphasis on technology – some assembly members disliked the “lack of emphasis on technological solutions” or noted “less reliance on technology / restricting travel.” − Feasibility – some assembly members felt a 10% reduction in car use per decade “will be hard” or queried “10% reduction in car use per decade – achievable?” Others asked “can the planning/rebuilding be done in time? How much shift is needed?” − Cost – assembly members had a variety of concerns around cost, including the affordability of public transport compared to alternatives. Some commented that “if public transport is not affordable it will cost more to use for holidays etc” or that the “train is expensive compared to alternatives.” Others worried about the “devaluation of current cars – or cars brought in the near future” or the “rebuilding costs” of towns. − Emissions – some assembly members said that this option would “take longer to achieve net zero emissions” or that “we will still be producing emissions from cars until later.” − “Impact on car building industry – reduces jobs” − “Reducing car use puts strain on other transport services” − “It would mean alternative ways to reduce emissions if EV is relaxed”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  73  When we asked assembly members to rank the possible futures in their order of preference, this scenario received very limited support from assembly members. Please see below for the results of the vote.  General comments Some assembly members made cross-cutting comments about all the possible futures:   Freedom versus restrictions: some assembly members wanted to emphasise the “need for personal freedom.” Others suggested that “we are already dealing with restrictions in our everyday lives so this is just one more.”    Roles: some assembly members noted that the “government has to take the lead to make things happen…. Onus needs to be on government to enable the policies – e.g. on public transport, better active travel.” Others noted that there is also an important role for business in creating change.    Public transport: some assembly members commented that “the train situation needs improving, people will be put off using the trains if they are stranded.”    Car industry: some assembly members noted that “the car industry will be affected across all scenarios.” Others said that “all [the futures] are bad [for the car industry]…. The car industry needs more time to adjust.”    Car size: some assembly members suggested that “some small cars are now only available in electric, because they don’t meet EU emission requirements. That means the cheapest cars won’t be the smallest.” Others said they were concerned that “people would buy a mid-sized petrol car because they can’t afford a smaller car, which would have a greater environmental impact.”    Synthetic fuels: some assembly members were unhappy that “we heard about the use of synthetic fuels for planes, but not cars.”    Hybrid cars: others noted that “all three futures talk about banning hybrid cars, but … some assembly members didn’t think that they were bad.”    Future generations: some assembly members commented that “the implications will impact some more than others – think future generations! Urgency matters!”    IT use: some assembly members asked “what about IT to reduce travel e.g. virtual reality.”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  74  Vote results Assembly members voted on the possible futures by secret ballot. The ballot paper asked them to rank the possible futures in their order of preference. The votes were counted in two ways:   Counting assembly members’ first preference votes only. This tells us what assembly members would and wouldn’t choose if they could have their preferred future.    Using Borda count. This involves allocating points for preferences – a first preference vote scored two points, a second preference vote one point. A third preference vote scored no points. Counting the votes like this tells us which futures are most acceptable to the greatest number of assembly members.  ‘Fast action to change the cars we drive’ received most first preference votes. Assembly members gave two reasons more than any others for this choice on their ballot papers. The first was around the lack of restriction on travel and lifestyles. Comments included:  “ We should be free to travel when and where we like – options 2 and 3 are restricting.” less government led social engineering the better. Restricting or imposing individual “ The behaviour undermines the liberal principle that everyone has the right to make choices and self-determination.” It focuses on introducing greener solutions but without taking the choice or car owners’ “ independence away.”  “ Least restrictions on mobility (standard of life).” The other frequently given rationale was the speed of change. Comments included: If we are going down this route (a must) then [the] quicker the better. Will be “hiccups” “ therefore [we need] time to “mend” problems.”  “ This guarantees fast action that I believe is required.” faster the better in spite of it being challenging. But don’t force a reduction in travel, “ The [stop] polluting transport only.” “ Rapid movement to electrified (low CO ) transport.” 2  Some assembly members’ rationale was multifaceted. For example: Fast decisive, immediate action – no time wasted planning on building new things so “ we can quickly start to reduce emissions and then focus on other things. Realistic, not a drastic change that is hard for everyone to adjust to. Benefits everyone – air quality improves, money saved on cars.”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  75  Figure 2: Possible futures  Please rank the possible futures in order of preference (% 1st preference votes)  % 50  49%  40  34% 30  20  17%  10  0 Fast action to change the cars we drive  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  Changing the cars we drive and how much we use them  Reducing the amount travelled across all transport types  76  actually think any option seems completely viable, but…) I think action has “ (Itodon’t be taken on current cars ASAP (although don’t necessarily agree with hybrid). If everyone could afford electric vehicles then this wouldn’t prevent people travelling as they currently do – ergo standard of living shouldn’t be compromised. Concerned other options don’t give enough time to fix other transport options. Also don’t believe people will reduce the amount they travel by car.” Other reasons highlighted by one or two assembly members included support for the take up of electric buses and trains, support for banning SUVs, a suggestion that this future has fewer downsides than the alternatives, and a belief that the “health benefits for people who have asthma would be important.” One assembly member commented that “social change is much harder than technological change.”  Figure 3: Possible futures  Please rank the possible futures in order of preference (Borda count)  50  42  45  25  18  0 Fast action to change the cars we drive  Changing the cars Reducing the we drive and how amount travelled much we use them across all transport types  ‘Fast action to change the cars we drive’ also did well in the Borda count, but the future that scored highest by a small margin was ‘changing the cars we drive and how much we use them’. Assembly members who chose this latter option as their first preference gave a range of reasons for their choice. There was a feeling amongst some assembly members that this option presented a balanced middle ground that was more viable and less radical: Most viable option – middle ground – more comprehensive approach that considers “ reducing and banning petrol/diesel and offers improvement and alternatives to how we can travel (instead of driving).”  “ There needs to be a balance and this seems to be the best balance.” “ Less radical compared to other options. More practical and positive.”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  77  Others talked about the impact this future would have on emissions and congestion: I think that by reducing car use we will reduce carbon emissions and maybe … “ focus on only using transport as a way from getting from A to B rather than being lazy!”  “ It will cut emissions and have health benefits.” “ Less cars, less pollution, less congestion.” Some assembly members said that they felt this future was less restrictive and offered more choice: I’m not supportive of restricting travel, improving public transport so citizens have “ more options is a positive step rather than an authoritarian move towards dictatorship I’m not supportive of.” perception of greater personal freedom to choose the most appropriate mode “ The of transport for any given journey.” Other comments included that this future “gives people time to adjust, whilst still taking positive action”, or that it “encourages public transport improvements and allows more time for the charging infrastructure to be sufficient for the uptake required.” ‘Reducing the amount travelled across all transport types’ scored poorly in terms of both first preference votes and the Borda count. It was assembly members’ least preferred option by some distance. One assembly member abstained from the votes, stating that the options were “not comprehensive and not objective.”  Futures – conclusions Taken together, assembly members’ discussions and votes suggest a future involving:   A ban on the sale of new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars by 2030–2035;    A reduction in the amount we use cars by an average of 2–5% per decade;    Improvements to public transport – the idea of better public transport was overwhelmingly mentioned as a positive in assembly members’ discussions. Some assembly members also welcomed the idea of improvements to the infrastructure for active transport.  Assembly members’ discussions show that many felt it was important to minimise restrictions on travel and lifestyles. They often saw a quick ban on the sale of new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars as the best way to do this: people could continue to travel by car as long as the car was electric. Some assembly members also raised doubts about whether greater reductions in car use were feasible in terms of behaviour change. For a smaller number of assembly members the least restrictive future was one that gave them the greatest choice of transport modes.  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  78  Speed of change was also an important factor for some assembly members. Those who supported an earlier ban on the sale petrol, diesel and hybrid cars felt “the faster, the better”. Others felt that a slightly later ban within the 2030–2035 range would give people longer to adapt and allow more time to prepare the necessary infrastructure. Assembly members saw co-benefits, particularly around improvements in air quality and reductions in congestion as positives. They also raised a range of concerns around affordability, including the need to not “price people out of essential travel.” Some assembly members particularly noted the need to avoid negative consequences for rural areas and people with a disability, as well as around mental health and isolation.  C. Policy options After considering what the future of surface transport in the UK could look like, assembly members moved on to consider how we might get there. Specifically they looked at policy options in three areas: 1.  Moving quickly to low carbon vehicles;  2.  Discouraging car ownership and use;  3.  Increasing the use of public and active transport.  For each of these areas, the Expert Leads recapped and explained potential policy options. Assembly members discussed these ideas in their groups before voting by secret ballot. They were also able to note additional suggestions for steps that could be taken.  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  79  C.1 Moving quickly to low carbon vehicles Assembly members looked at seven options for moving quickly to low carbon vehicles:   Quickly stop selling the most polluting cars;    Grants for businesses and people to buy low carbon cars;    Car scrappage scheme;    Advertising restrictions on certain cars;    Access to longer range cars for electric car owners;    Government investment in low carbon buses and/or trains;    Lowering speed limits on dual carriage ways and motorways.  We start by presenting the rationale for their views, taking each policy option in turn.  Jump to the vote results on page 89  Quickly stop selling the most polluting cars This would involve telling car companies that they could not sell their most polluting cars in the UK from a certain date. The government has already told car companies that they will not be able to sell new petrol and diesel cars in future. The date of this ban was originally 2040 when it was announced in 2019, but was brought forward to 2035 in February 2020. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about a quick stop to selling the most polluting cars.  Pros + Co-benefits – some assembly members suggested there would be “improved air quality” or an “immediate decrease in pollution.” Others said that we would “quickly start cutting down pollution”, “reduce pollution more quickly” or “decrease the polluting cars on the road drastically.” Some noted benefits for “health and safety e.g. in schools – air quality” or “improvement for other road users.” + Swift and simple – some assembly members suggested it is “very easy to implement ASAP”, “simple to implement”, “swift and simple to implement” or that it “gets the whole process going – no ‘faffing’ around – just do it.” Others labelled it a “fast and effective solution that does not require a lot of new tech.” Some commented that the “quicker these cars are removed from the roads the better.” + Good cost-benefit ratio – some assembly members described it as a “quick fix that’s not really that detrimental to anyone’s way of life” or commented “we don’t need SUVs on the road.” Others said there was “large benefit, lowish cost.”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  80  + Impact on emissions – some assembly members said it “will accelerate [the] net zero target”, create a “big drop in emissions” or result in a “quicker reduction in average CO2 emissions.” + Certainty for business – some assembly members liked that “car manufacturers [would] know where they stand” or that there would be “certainty for manufacturers.” + Progress on electric car manufacture and uptake – some assembly members felt it would “encourage manufacturers to improve electric cars” or that “uptake of electric cars would increase dramatically.”  Cons − Loss in revenue from fuel duty – some assembly members worried about a “fuel tax deficit”. Others commented “loss in revenues – how to replace?”, “fuel tax will need to be replaced by other taxes – fairness”, or “government will need to find the lost revenue from fuel tax elsewhere.” − Impact on business and jobs – some assembly members noted that “car companies will have to adjust” or that “if car companies are losing money there will be jobs lost.” − “Reduction in personal choice of vehicles” − “What will happen to all unwanted vehicles?” − “[Need to] define polluting” − “No willingness to change!”  Grants for businesses and people to buy low carbon cars Since 2011, the government has given car dealerships money to discount the price of brand-new electric and hydrogen cars. In the budget in March 2020, the plug-in car grant was extended for another three years, but the amount available per car was reduced to £3,000 from £3,500, and it is only available for pure battery electric cars that cost £50,000 or less. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about grants for businesses and people to buy low carbon cars.  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  81  Pros + Accessibility – some assembly members felt that it would mean “owning EV is more accessible” or commented that “off-setting initial costs can make electric vehicles more accessible for the general public.” Others said that “it needs to be affordable to everyone.” + “Kick start market for electric cars” + “Fleet vehicles should be EV”  Cons − Grants not enough – some assembly members said that the “grants aren’t high enough for purchasing a new EV”, that the “grant’s not enough at £3,500”, or that the “grant [is] not big enough.” Others commented that “electric cars [are] still expensive, even with grants” or that “£3,500 is not that big an incentive to buy an electric car!” − Impact on EV prices – some assembly members asked “won’t car companies put prices up if [they are] receiving a grant?” or suggested it was a “disincentive for manufacturers to reduce cost.” Others labelled it “good for the dealer, not the buyer; benefit should go direct to the buyer.” − “Cars will [still] be unaffordable to the less well off” − “Not everyone wants to drive so do they get taxed extra?” − “Rapid collapse of value of diesel, petrol cars” − “No incentives for 2nd hand EV”  Some assembly members also noted conditions around their support for this policy option, or additional ideas:   Comparative price: some assembly members said that the “grant has to take it to same or below [the] price of petrol/diesel”, that it’s a “good incentive if [the] price is similar to current cars”, or that their support “depends on [the] size of grant;”    Tax incentives: some assembly members suggested there should be “more incentives i.e. no VAT on EV for 5 years” or that there should be “tax incentives to buy low carbon cars.”    Who the grants help: some assembly members said policy-makers should “relate [the] grant to people’s income” or that the grants “need to be aimed at low income families and those in hard to reach rural areas and not for business for it to be fair;”    Others disagreed saying they would support the policy “if the grant is only for business;”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  82  Car scrappage scheme This would involve incentivising owners of older, high CO2 vehicles to scrap them, by offering cash or credit towards electric cars, bikes or public transport season tickets. The amount people received towards an electric car is likely to be around £2,000. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about a car scrappage scheme.  Pros + “Provides financial incentive to sell polluting vehicles” + “Great if your car is worth less than the payment receive” + “Will encourage more electric car sales” + “Gives the ability to use money on bikes or public transport” + “Improvements with air pollution” + “Only one that has an impact on CO2 immediately” + “Can still reuse/recycle vehicle”  Cons − Waste – some assembly members worried about a “lack of capacity to process recycling of removed cars.” Others asked “where will they go” or “what % of scrapped cars can be recycled? Working cars being scrapped feels wasteful.” − Costs and pricing – some assembly members suggested that it “only works for cars valued below £2k”, that it’s “only applicable for old/low value cars”, or that you “might not get [the] full value of [the] car.” Others said “have to buy a new car – price inflated.” − Subsidising foreign manufacturers – some assembly members said “public expenditure [would be] used to subsidise manufacturers yet most new cars are manufactured overseas” or that “you need to focus the credit on bikes and public transport so you don’t subsidise foreign manufacturers.” − “Even with the car scrappage scheme a lot of people still can’t afford electric cars”  As with the previous policy option, some assembly members suggested that the grant should “relate … to people’s income.”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  83  Advertising restrictions on certain cars Advertising restrictions would make it illegal for car manufacturers to advertise their most polluting cars. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about advertising restrictions on certain cars.  Pros + Proven – some assembly members commented that it’s “proven to work” or “it works very well.” Others said “people are more likely to buy when they are advertised” or that adverts are “proven techniques to reach large populations.” + Discouraging production of most polluting cars – some assembly members said it “would hopefully discourage production of polluting cars” or that it “removes [an] incentive to make more SUVs as demand should reduce.” + Cost – some assembly members liked that there is “no cost to [the] tax payer” or that there’s “no cost to introduce.” Others suggested it is “very easy to implement tomorrow at low cost for a lowering of emissions.” + “Doesn’t impact on people’s options” + “Stops pollution/sets rules” + Some assembly members said it worked well with the policy option to ‘quickly stop selling the most polluting cars’, suggesting that the “advertising will follow.”  Cons − “Should discourage production – not ban advertising – this is wasteful and punitive” − “I don’t think this would have much impact. I think people buy based on what they see driven around rather than on TV” − “Ways around it – petrol heads are clued up” − “Does it give [the] wrong message?” − “It doesn’t go far enough” − “Negative impact on the economy”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  84  Access to longer range cars for electric car owners A scheme like this would mean that, when a customer buys an all-electric car, it would be compulsory for the car company to loan a longer-range vehicle to them for several days a year. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about access to longer range cars for electric car owners.  Pros + Freedom – some assembly members said it would provide “long-distance access outside cities” or that it “lessens restrictions, helps in keeping current freedoms.” + Addresses a key problem / may increase take-up – some assembly members felt it “solves a key issue that many people raise. A very good option that incentivises people to buy electric cars.” Others felt it would “increase use of electric vehicles” or, more cautiously, that “maybe it would make EV an option.” + “Cost” + “If you legislate that car sellers must do this, it costs nothing to implement”  Cons − Practical issues – some assembly members felt there would be practical issues. Comments included: “Needs planning ahead – not always an option” “What about emergencies? Not practical” “Limit to how long you can have them for?” “Not long enough. Would need weeks or more occasions” “Availability: -Christmas -Half-term” “Booking availability, holiday at same time etc.” − Feasibility and bureaucracy – some assembly members feared it would be “bureaucratic” or suggested “car dealers [are] highly unlikely to loan cars and [it would be] very difficult to manage [the] process.” − Limits to freedom unless more charging points – some assembly members said it “wouldn’t give range of freedom as you are limited to charging points” or that “electric cars only have a short range (120 miles) so would need more charging points.” − Not needed? – some assembly members suggested it “may not be needed e.g. hire, rail” or asked “why can’t they all be long range?” − “Only benefits those with money for new cars”  Some assembly members asked “would there be a scheme for 2nd hand EV?”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  85  Government investment in low carbon buses and/or trains The government already subsidises some electric and hydrogen buses. There is also currently a programme to electrify the railways, but it has recently slowed.6 Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about government investment in low carbon buses and/or trains.  Pros + Better, more accessible public transport – some assembly members suggested that “investment is absolutely necessary to make these options more affordable and accessible”, or that this is an “opportunity for radical redesign of buses (accessibility).” Others commented that the “more efficient public transport, [the] more people would use it.” + Needed – some assembly members said “we need it!” or it “needs to be done sooner rather than later.” Others said it’s “self-explanatory really and needs to be done.” + Jobs and industry – some assembly members suggested it would “revitalise [the] train industry” or said it “would be good if government investment in low carbon jobs can create skills and careers.” + Leadership and responsibility – some assembly members said it “doesn’t push the responsibility for change on [to the] public only. It initiates the process of change.” Similarly, others commented that it would involve “lead[ing] by example.” + “Improves air quality for commuters” + “Focusing on investing more in public transport will reduce emissions a lot as the number of users is high” + “Will help speed up the understanding of hydrogen power”  Cons − Cost and who pays – some assembly members asked “who pays”, “where is the money coming from?”, or “how much would it cost, would it be economically viable? − Tech issues and practicalities – some assembly members suggested that the “battery range for a bus surely won’t be long enough for most journeys”, or that it “will take a long time to charge.” Others asked “what happens with a power cut?” − “How realistic is it to electrify the rails? And how soon can these changes be implemented?” − “More electricity is needed so better infrastructure” − “Would take a very long time to actually reduce emissions”  6  HC Deb, 20 July 2017, col 72WS. The Government announced the cancellation of many newly electrified lines in favour of hybrid (bi-modal) trains.  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  86  Some assembly members said they would support this policy option if we “move quickly to low carbon vehicles”, or “if [it’s] quicker (speed).” Others noted that “if Government/Parliament implement public transport to run for longer and at later times people would use it more.”  Lowering speed limits on dual carriage ways and motorways This would involve lowering the speed limit for cars on roads where it is 70mph to 60mph. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about lowering speed limits on dual carriageways and motorways.  Pros + Immediate effect – some assembly members described it as “immediate” or suggested it’s “very easy to do tomorrow and immediately reduces emissions.” Another commented: “I like lowering speed limits on dual carriageways and motorways because it seems like a straightforward enough method that has immediate positive impacts.” + Reducing accidents – some assembly members noted it would “reduce accidents” or “also [have] benefits in reducing RTAs [Road Traffic Accidents].” + Impact on emissions – some said it would “reduce carbon” or result in “decreased carbon emissions.” + “Lowers the speed limit thus cutting down on the use of fuel” + “Increased fines for the treasury – voluntary tax”  Cons − Compliance and enforcement – some assembly members said they “don’t believe people would stick to this at all” or that “no one will abide [by it] anyway.” Others said “no one sticks to [the] limit as it is so I can’t see it working without a lot of intervention” or “it won’t work unless you’re going to restrict the cars and have someone policing it – people will carry on going 70+.” Some assembly members queried “do [the] police have resources to enforce this“ or suggested there is “insufficient capacity for enforcement.” Some said it would be “difficult to enforce.” − Journey times – some assembly members said they disliked the impact on “journey times”, or that it “increases journey time. The limits may not be needed on electric cars?” Others felt that “lowering speed will affect productivity, [and] impact on people’s working day, [and] free time.” − “It is a con for electric cars. It would put people off buying electric cars because there is no benefit to using them” − “Will surely increase concertina effect and increase standing traffic and pollution” − “Still isn’t going to lower emissions enough!”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  87  Some assembly members said this policy option would need to be accompanied by “advice and education on how to drive more efficiently.” Others said the premise should be that “EVs are run on 100% (90%) green energy by 2030.”  Additional ideas During their discussions, assembly members noted a range of additional points and suggestions:  “ You need to address [electricity] supply before EVs” “ You must get people on your side” “ Need [for] education” “ Make city centres car free (with free public transport to replace it)” “ Congestion charging” “ Synthetic fuels” “ Wealth tax on high end polluters/vehicles” Legislate that businesses (such as Uber, car clubs, hire cars etc) must only use EVs going “ forward and legislate that going forward all delivery vehicles must be EVs” “ More criteria to get a driver’s licence less people, alter behaviour” “ Car scrappage scheme to support the purchase of 2nd hand EVs.”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  88  Vote results Assembly members voted by secret ballot on the seven policy options for moving quickly to low carbon vehicles. There were two ballot papers. The first ballot paper asked assembly members how much they agreed or disagreed that each policy option should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. The second ballot paper asked them to rank the options in their order of preference. The votes from this second ballot paper were counted both in terms of first preference votes and via Borda count.  Figure 4: Moving quickly to low carbon vehicles  How much do you agree or disagree that each of the following policy options should be part of how the UK gets to net zero? (%) % 100  11% 3% 23%  3% 6% 14%  9% 6% 29%  43%  50  6% 3% 26%  23%  29% 29%  63% 31%  3% 3% 3% 14%  11%  34%  77%  9%  37%  29%  14% 31% 9% 23% 23%  23%  0 Quickly stop selling the most polluting cars  Grants for businesses and people to buy low carbon cars 7  Strongly disagree  Disagree  Car scrappage scheme  Advertising restrictions on certain cars  Don’t mind/unsure  Agree  Access to longer range cars for electric car owners  Government investment in low carbon buses and/or trains  Lowering speed limits on dual carriageways and motorways  Strongly agree  Two policy options stood out for their popularity amongst assembly members. Large majorities of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that ‘government investment in low carbon buses and/or trains’ (91%) and ‘quickly stop selling the most polluting vehicles’ (86%) should be part of how the UK gets to net zero.7 Two options also stood out for their lack of popularity. Under half of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that ‘access to longer range cars for electric car owners’ (32%) and ‘lowering speed limits on dual carriageways and motorways’ (46%) should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. There was also significant opposition to both measures, with 34% and 45% of assembly members ‘strong disagreeing’ or ‘disagreeing’ that they should be used. Although a large number of assembly members (34%) said they ‘didn’t mind’ or ‘were unsure’ about access to longer range vehicles, these results do suggest it was less popular than other options. 7  One assembly member abstained from the vote on ‘grants for business and people to buy low carbon cars’ so the figures for this option add up to 97% not 100%.  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  89  Smaller majorities of assembly members supported the three other policy options. In order of assembly members’ preference, these were:   Grants for businesses and people to buy low carbon cars – 74% ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that they should be part of how the UK gets to net zero; 14% said they were ‘unsure’ or ‘don’t mind’;    Car scrappage scheme – 66% ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’; 26% said they were ‘unsure’ or ‘don’t mind’;    Advertising restrictions on certain cars – 58% ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’. 29% said they were ‘unsure’ or ‘don’t mind’.  The preference voting largely reinforced the results of the first vote, but provided two additional insights. The results suggest that:   ‘Quickly stop selling the most polluting cars’ was the most important policy to assembly members by some distance, followed by ‘government investment in low carbon buses and/or trains’;    Amongst options that a majority of assembly members supported in the first vote, ‘advertising restrictions on certain cars’ was their least preferred policy by some distance.  ‘Access to longer range cars’ and ‘lowering speed limits’ again scored more poorly than the other policy options.

We start by presenting the rationale for their views, taking each policy option in turn.  Jump to the vote results on page 101  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  91  Closing roads to cars This would involve restricting cars in certain lanes, roads or zones. It could eventually mean that cars are not allowed in most town centres. There could also be temporary closures, such as regular car free days. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about closing roads to cars.  Pros + Reduced pollution and health benefits – some assembly members said it would “cu[t] pollution”, result in “cleaner air”, or make a “fast improvement to air quality.” Others suggested it would be “better for pedestrians’ and residents’ health.” + Other uses for roads and safer spaces – some assembly members commented that you “may be able to utilise the roads that were shut” or that “closure would make a lot of sense e.g. times when children are playing.” Others said it would create “safer spaces” or liked “keeping cars off the road legally! For safe walking/cycling.” Some assembly members said it would result in “more pedestrian areas.” + Benefits for towns, cities, high streets – some assembly members felt it “would create more environment friendly towns and cities”, or suggested that areas would “need to have better public services which could lead to a revival of the high street.” + Feasible / achievable – some assembly members commented that “park and ride in cities is shown to work” or suggested that it “can be done very quickly by investing in electric buses.” + “More active travel in towns/cities” + “This would make people think of other options; they might end up preferring this”  Cons − Impact on certain groups and essential activities – some assembly members said it “can unduly impact disabled [people]” or asked “what about people with disabilities?” Others suggested it would “discourage certain groups of people from visiting”, “may limit people from doing things they need to do”, or that “exemptions [would be] needed for some workers.” − Congestion and emissions – some assembly members suggested that “closing down roads would congest roads therefore increasing emissions”, that there would be “more traffic jams” or “more congestion, more emission, more pollution.” Others said it would simply result in “more traffic/business elsewhere” or “higher carbon emissions in other areas.” − “It would not provide an opportunity for cycling lanes” − “People taking longer journeys to get to the same place” − “Supporting local businesses – may suffer if people can’t drive into town”  Some assembly members said this policy option is “only good if transport infrastructure is good.”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  92  Charging to use the roads This would involve charging drivers according to (a) which roads they use at which times of day; and (b) how polluting their car is. This could be done either nationally or locally. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about charging to use the roads.  Pros + Increasing awareness and behaviour change – some assembly members felt this would “make people more considerate of the pollution their car is giving off.” Others said it “may make people change!” or “would cut out unimportant journeys.” + The polluter pays – some assembly members liked that it “would make the drivers who use the roads pay more for the privilege” or that “the polluter pays.” Others said that it “seems fairer than other propositions”, that it’s “potentially fair (depending on how implemented)”, or that it’s an “even and fair approach between those who need to use cars because they live in rural areas where public transport is not common and those who don’t have to because they live in cities.” + Money for government – some assembly members commented that “government can get a lot of money from the charges, especially from busy crossings.” Others liked that the “duty is not ring-fenced. Politicians should spend [the money] where needed.” + Flexibility to help low paid – some assembly members suggested that as it’s a “simple usage tax [you] can have a free allowance (mileage free) for low paid.” Others said they liked that “low income families are subsidised.” + “Would be in favour of temporary charging times to ease congestion/pollution” + “Very quickly reduces emissions” + “Toll roads used abroad” + “You decide how much you spend”  Cons − Data and privacy – some assembly members asked “will the government abuse the data, sell it etc” or cautioned “big brother – concern about being tracked and where data goes.” − Impact on low paid – some assembly members said it risked “causing a rich/poor rift – everything needs to be affordable for everyone.” Others commented that the “increased cost would put a strain on the lower paid” or that “if people are on a tight budget it would put people off going [to] places if they are going to get a road users’ bill.” − “Creates unintended traffic blight through diverting to other routes” − “Could inflate the cost of delivered goods massively” − “Impact on small businesses”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  93  − “Important to consider all aspects of travel. Car type, mpg, road, time etc” − “Fairness issues” − “Need choice to use ‘toll’”  Some assembly members noted conditions that would need to be met for them to support this policy, or additional suggestions for how it could work:   “If selective about what times of day, like rush hour”    “If just towns and cities”    “Providing they get rid of the road tax”    “Must subsidise lower income families to make it fair”    “It has to go hand in hand with affordable public transport”    “Good, but must be used for right reasons (Big Brother)”    “Using new tech, cars should be charged per mile”  Increasing fuel duty This would involve increasing fuel tax on petrol and diesel. The money raised could be used to improve alternatives to travelling by car, although this isn’t the case at the moment. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about increasing fuel duty.  Pros + “Would make drivers reduce their travel and consider alternative transport” + “Easier for individuals to budget for than road charging” + “Used to value travel by car – more use, more pay” + “Very quickly reduces emissions” + “The polluter pays” + “Potentially fair. Most closely related to CO2 emissions”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  94  Cons − Impact on certain groups – some assembly members felt it would “price people out of driving …[who] may not have other alternatives.” Others said “only the wealthy will [be able to] afford to drive.” − Problems with how it would work – some assembly members disliked the “uneven distribution of charges” or stated that “all cars should pay the same tax regardless of age etc.”8 − Lack of impact – some assembly members commented that “we already pay a high fuel duty compared to other countries and it hasn’t reduced car use” or that the “duty [is] already high and had no impact.” − What money gets spent on – some assembly disliked that the money raised “doesn’t get spent on improving public transport” or that the “money isn’t ring-fenced.” − Prices – some assembly members worried that “prices will rise” or asked “will it affect bus prices? Delivery costs go up?” − “Impact on small businesses/delivery vehicles” − “[Ring-fencing] Will cause a large hole in government funding streams”  Some assembly members noted conditions that would need to be met for them to support the policy, or additional suggestions for how it could work:   Ring-fence money: some assembly members said they would support it “only if [the] increase [is] hypothecated and used to fund CO2 emission reduction.” Others said the money raised it “needs to be spent on net zero;”    Help for certain groups: some said they would support it “if [there is a] reduced tax in the countryside/rural areas because fuel [is] more expensive” or “as long as low income families are subsidised and it is ring-fenced for sustainable spending.”  Some assembly members said it should “provide more incentive for electric car usage” or was “okay on [the] worst polluters.”  Local business levy This would involve charging businesses for each parking space that they own, or for each person that they employ. The money would be used to improve alternatives to travelling by car in that area. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about a local business levy.  8  The Expert Leads had noted that cars that use less fuel and therefore produce less carbon emissions would pay less duty.  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  95  Pros + Charge to business not individuals – some assembly members liked the “cost being passed to the business not [the] individual” or “taking it off the individual – only if businesses pay!” + Raising money – others suggested it “helps the government cover costs” or is a “very easy way to raise money for green spending as long as it is relative to business size.” + “Would encourage staff/businesses to use alternative transport e.g. cycles, car share, buses” + “It works in Dunkirk”9 + “The land can be used for other businesses (encourage public/shared transport)”  Cons − Impact on certain groups – some assembly members said that “exemptions [would be] needed for disabled employees reliant on cars” or that it is “bad for shift and key workers where public transport [is] not available.” − Impact on businesses and fairness between different businesses – some assembly members said that a “business levy for parking is tax on business” or suggested “some businesses could struggle to find extra money.” Others labelled it an “extra expense for small businesses” or said it “could see small businesses going under.” Some assembly members made additional points: “Businesses with private land and lots of spaces will be penalised” “Very unfair: employee density vs business profitability e.g. supermarket vs bit-barn” “Companies will struggle to hire employees if they find it inconvenient to travel to work or have to find alternate transportation when they have a car” − Cost to employee (passing on the cost) – some assembly members said that businesses “will charge employees to go to work” or disliked “employees having to pay to go to work” or the “cost to [the] employee.” − Disincentive to employ staff – some assembly members felt it would act as a “disincentive to employ staff” or a “disincentive for employment.” − Where people end up parking – some assembly members felt it “encourages parking away from work in residential areas” or suggested that a “lack of parking spaces creates conflict between local businesses and residents.”  Some assembly members said they would support the policy “as long as it [the levy] is relative to business size.” 9  As previously noted, this referred back to a case study presented by one of the speakers, Lynn Sloman, during Weekend Two of the assembly. It showed the impact of introducing free bus travel in Dunkirk in autumn 2018. Bus trips increased 85%, and half of the new bus users previously travelled by car. Lynn’s talk is available at climateassembly.uk/resources/  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  96  Reducing parking space This would involve reducing parking space through double yellow lines, residential parking zones, removing car parks, making car parks smaller and/or liming parking space for new houses. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about reducing parking space.  Pros + “Will reduce vehicles going into towns/city [with people] using public transport [instead]” + “There should be areas free from parking such as schools and elderly people’s homes” + “More space for growing natural sources and more pleasant societies” + “Very easy to do. Loss in revenue can be balanced by a business levy”  Cons − Where people would park – some assembly members predicted a “displacement of parking on to side roads or pavements.” Others said that “people tend to park illegally if there is no parking space.” − Impact on high streets – some assembly members stated that “reducing car spaces could result in lost revenue to high streets” or that “removing car space will impact on town shopping.” Others felt there would be a “big impact on local businesses e.g. retail shops.” − Impact on certain groups – some assembly members suggested that “people who are reliant on cars would not be able to get around” or that it “punishes residents who may need a car for any number of reasons.” − Compatibility with other changes needed – some assembly members asked “if we’re encouraging people to have electric cars, but decreasing parking – how will people charge their cars?” Others queried “if we reduce space where will the electric cars, car club cars and car sharing cars go that we are trying to incentivise?” − Congestion – some assembly members said “reducing parking space leads to congestion” or that “reducing parking spaces would cause more congestion on the roads.” − “Conflates parking shortage with climate change issues” − “People need to go places, so need to park” − “Business park car parks – what would the space be used for?” − “Could affect house prices” − “Personal experience of conflict between local businesses and residents over employee parking”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  97  Some assembly members said decision-makers would need to be “careful how you apply [the policy] – don’t conflate [it] with revenue raising” or that it “could increase the use of public transport (need better infrastructure).”  Car sharing This would involve getting more people to share vehicles through ‘match-making’ apps and incentives like carpool lanes and exemptions from parking charges. This may require some financial support for businesses and local authorities to set up and operate the software, and to develop and enforce car pool lanes and car parking spaces. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about car sharing.  Pros + “Alternative to owning a car but still have independence” + “Share petrol costs, parking” + “Affordable for those on lower income” + “Can cut emissions cheaply if done by an app or employers” + “Carpool fares – can incentivise the use of car sharing”  Cons − Loss of independence – some assembly members disliked the “loss of independence” or “being reliant on someone else. What if ill? Car trouble? Insurance?” − People not keen – some assembly members said “people aren’t keen” or that “many people would feel uncomfortable car-sharing – we have this option already but there is a reason why it is so unpopular.” − Safety – some assembly members raised concerns about “security/personal safety”, “safety concerns, who am I getting into a car with?” or “safeguarding.” Others noted you “could be sharing your car with anyone.” − Abusing the system and enforcement – some assembly members worried about the “potential to abuse the system” with others suggesting “ways would have to be found of enforcing/checking car share” or asking “does the app pay the driver? How do you enforce sharing cash?” − “May increase journey time and CO2 output” − “Time/cost” − “Car insurance issues”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  98  Some assembly said they would support this policy “if organised by a company – they could pay.” Similarly, others said it “needs to be well organised” or that we “need to use apps/methods so [it’s] organised.”  Car clubs This would involve pay-as-you-go renting of cars that are available throughout your area. These would be booked through an app and could be used for short periods of time. At the moment car clubs tend to be run by commercial operators. They do however need local authority funds to dedicate car parking spaces to them, promote them, and provide some subsidy for electric vehicles. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about car clubs.  Pros + Benefits for certain groups – some assembly members felt it would be “especially good for retired people who don’t use their car, very often” or would result in “cheaper insurance for young people than owning a car.” Others felt it would “help lower income holders to also have this option” or that it could be “use[d] for shift workers’ systems.” + Less car ownership – some assembly members felt it would result in “less car ownership” or labelled it a “great idea for reducing the need for buying a car.” + Cost effective, easy, convenient and clean – some assembly members suggested it is a “cost effective solution”, or that it “could be [a] cost effective and easier solution.” Others said it is “very easy to implement and clean if car clubs must use EVs.” Some assembly members commented that it is “convenient, easy”, or “excellent in cities – works with Zipcar and in Paris.” + “I like this because I think it is viable. There is a rise in popularity of renting things and subscriptions because there is less responsibility and commitment. If they are renting the car they also don’t need to worry about managing and repairing the car”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  99  Cons − Practical issues – some assembly members raised “concern about what happens if [you] damage [the car]” or queried “insurance issues?” or “insurance?” − Doesn’t work in rural areas – some assembly members said they were “concerned about how many cars there would need to be in rural areas” or that it “only works practically in urban [areas].” − “Requires lots of organisation to plan booking a car to presume when you need it” − “Time to pick up/drop off” − “More people drive that don’t already” − “People become less able, less confident drivers” − “Money isn’t ring-fenced” − “Variable costs? If so then accessibility?” − “What’s the difference between car clubs and traditional car rental?”  Some assembly members commented that it “needs to be affordable” or that it “works better in some areas than others e.g. urban vs rural.”  Localisation This would involve changing regulation to ensure that new houses can only be built with good public transport links. It would also involve including or putting back into local areas services such as post offices, local shops, health centres and schools. Assembly members identified a number of pros and cons about localisation.  Pros + Better community ties – some assembly members said localisation “could create better community ties in new developments”, “could improve social isolation as they need shops/ doctors.” Others noted that “many new developments have little community amenities so this would improve community engagement in local areas.” + Better amenities and accessibility – some assembly members felt that “town planning needs to include services and transport” or liked the idea of “post office revival.” Some said that “all society would have accessibility.” + Reduction in car dependency and ownership – some assembly members felt it would “discourage car dependency” or “reduce the need for private car ownership” or “encourage people to walk leaving the car at home and exercise” + “A good long-term solution. Legislate property developer to invest in transport infrastructure” + “Seems like an obvious action to implement”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  100  Cons − Difficult to make work – some assembly members raised queries about “feasibility”, asking “how would this be implemented?” or saying they “don’t think this will happen.” Others suggested it would be “difficult to recruit doctors” or “difficult to encourage business.” Some said thinking was needed on “how to get ‘services’ to back ‘localisation’.” − Green belt loss – some assembly members suggested it would “upset environmentalists and [to] expect opposition if you want to build on green belts.” Others suggested there would be “green belt loss” with “wildlife affected”, or that “green belt loss will result in [an] urban spiral.” − “High density living is low quality of life” − “Unsure about time frame” − “Loss of economies of scale of distribution means higher price of goods” − “Not always optional for everyone!”  Additional ideas During their discussions on discouraging car ownership and use, some assembly members noted additional points or suggestions:   Carbon zones in every city/town;    If car use is to be discouraged then “public transport infrastructure ... must be in place”;    “Car ownership per se isn’t the problem. An (e.g. old) polluting car that does little/ no miles isn’t polluting”;    “Amazon deliveries – should be delivered to work or [we need] localisation. We know this is freight but [it] has impacts on localisation and what we buy and how.”  Vote results Assembly members voted by secret ballot on the eight policy options for discouraging car ownership and use. There were two ballot papers. The first ballot paper asked assembly members how much they agreed or disagreed that each policy option should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. The second ballot paper asked them to rank the options in their order of preference. The votes from this second ballot paper were counted both in terms of first preference votes and via Borda count.  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  101  Figure 7: Discouraging car ownership and use  How much do you agree or disagree that each of the following policy options should be part of how the UK gets to net zero?

In general, levels of agreement were lower and levels of disagreement significantly higher. Many assembly members had been clear when discussing the future of surface transport in the UK (see Section B above) that they wanted to minimise restrictions on travel and lifestyles. Their comparative dislike of policy options for discouraging car ownership and use is consistent with that view. A majority of assembly members supported four of the policy options for discouraging car ownership and use. In assembly members’ order of preference these were:   Localisation – 72% of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that this should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. 20% ‘strongly disagreed’ or ‘disagreed’;    Car clubs – 59% ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’. Levels of disagreement were low, with more assembly members (31%) saying they ‘didn’t mind’ or ‘were unsure’;    Charging to use the roads – 56% ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’. 39% ‘strongly disagreed’ or ‘disagreed’;    Closing roads to cars – 53% ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’. 22% ‘strongly disagreed’ or ‘disagreed’.  Only a minority of assembly members supported the other policy options. The least popular was ‘reducing parking space’; a sizeable majority of assembly members (67%) strongly disagreed or disagreed with this proposal.

These results suggest that ‘closing roads to cars’ is more acceptable to a greater number of assembly members than ‘charging to use the roads’ or ‘car clubs’.  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  103  C.3 Increasing the use of public and active transport Assembly members looked at seven options for increasing the use of public and active transport:   Adding new routes and more frequent services;    Increasing investment to make buses faster and more reliable;    On-demand buses;    Making public transport cheaper;    Bringing public transport back under government control;    Investing in cycling and scootering facilities;    Grants to buy electric bikes.  We start by presenting the rationale for their views, taking each policy option in turn.  Jump to the vote results on page 112  Adding new routes and more frequent services This would involve increasing relevant government funds paid to local authorities, so that the latter could add new routes and/or provide more buses on existing routes. There are many services that private bus companies will not operate because they are not profitable. Government funding to plug this gap has been cut in recent years. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about adding new routes and more frequent services.  Pros + Reduced car use – some assembly members liked the idea of “new routes to areas that feel the need to drive as there is no alternative.” Others noted that “people would not have to use cars for essential journeys.” + More people would use the service – some assembly members felt that it “would encourage more people to use the service” or that “improvement would increase use.” + “Increase government funding should enable more routes… and bring back closed down routes”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  104  Cons − Unrealistic – some assembly members suggested that “people who live in places with no bus route will already have cars, so not use buses.” Others said that “bus services are still unusable in rural areas – unrealistic to make [them] comparable to [a] car.” − Cost and use of money – some assembly members worried about the “cost to [the] taxpayer”, or asked “how much would it cost? Would it effect investment in other areas?” Others said that “if [it] remains in [the] private sector then [it] will cost more money” or that “private companies currently waste money on routes that are empty.” − “Relies on infrastructure to implement” − “Needs enough people using it for it to be a benefit”  Some assembly members advocated “research [on] where routes are most needed” or said they would support this idea “if bus routes run earlier and later.” Others said it “would only be worth doing if price of travel reduces.”  Increasing investment to make buses faster and more reliable This would involve investment in bus priority lanes and better interchanges such as bus stations. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about increasing investment to make buses faster and more reliable.  Pros + Increasing public transport use – some assembly members said that “if [the] bus service is faster, more people will use the bus”, that “faster bus services will be an incentive for people who drive for faster travel” or that it “would encourage people to use public transport.” + Reducing car use and congestion – some assembly members suggested that “full buses reduce road congestion” or that “more bus lanes = more buses = less cars.” + Support for particular technologies – some assembly members suggested “investing in hydrogen buses – no CO2” or that an “increase in investment [in] bus infrastructure in cities could include overhead electric rail to reduce emissions as well.”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  105  Cons − Feasibility – some assembly members said it “sounds great, but don’t see it being feasible because of space being taken up.” Others suggested that “not all roads are capable of being converted to include bus lanes especially where cycle lanes already exist.” Some assembly members queried “is congestion an issue? If so, they won’t be reliable.” − “Would it be worth the investment? Smart motorways have caused massive travel disruption for little benefit” − “Faster buses = more CO2?”  Some assembly members commented that implementation would be “reliant on develop[ing] infrastructure.”  On-demand buses This would involve buses in rural areas and smaller towns that you can call through an app or phone. These buses would pick you up from where you are and drop you where you need to go, or to another bus or rail interchange. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about on-demand buses.  Pros + Benefit to certain groups – some assembly members suggested that it “could help people in more isolated areas, especially the elderly who need to get to doctors appointments etc.” Others said it “hopefully will be a benefit to [the] elderly and people in rural areas.” + Stopping empty buses – some assembly members said that it “could ensure buses are full (depending on how it works)” or that it “stops empty buses from driving around taking space and polluting.” + “Gives people more independence (may give up car)” + “On-demand (small) buses could be electric” + “Shared (Uber)” + “Cheap solution”  Cons − Not accessible to everyone – some assembly members said it “may not be suitable for disabled [people]” or that “it might be harder for older or disabled people to use as it requires a smart phone and app etc.”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  106  − Feasibility, including signal and internet access – some assembly members noted “issues with internet access” or said that “if you need to get somewhere in an emergency and there’s no signal you won’t be able to use the app.” Others said they “can’t see how it could effectively work e.g. rural areas.” − Practicalities for passengers – some assembly members said there would be the “worry [you] might not get one and then [have] no transport.” Others said they are “concerned people [would be] inconvenienced because [they] have to wait.” Others queried “time – it would take longer if picking people up?” − Costs – some assembly members said it “could be loss making” or that “increase[d] cost for on demand buses would be an additional cost to [the] tax payer.” − “Concerned empty buses sitting around” − “Don’t think really it is on demand”  Some assembly members said it would be “good if you can call up as well (older people like to phone)” or felt “there will be an element of trial and error.”  Making public transport cheaper This would involve discounted or free buses or trains. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about making public transport cheaper.  Pros + More people would use / consider it – some assembly members suggested that “making public transport cheaper and more reliable could result in more users” or that “making it free would encourage way more people to use it.” One assembly member commented “this could convince me to get public transport more even if the journey takes longer.” Other assembly members suggested that it “would make bus/train travel more of [a] considered option” or that it “would be a good financial incentive for commuters.” + Reducing car use – some assembly members said it “might encourage people to give up their cars” or that “currently people are priced out of public travel. [This is an] [i]ncentive not to drive.” Others noted “free travel = convenient for everyone and replaces cars.” + Benefits to economy – some assembly members suggested that “affordability allows people to travel more. Could boost economy as more spending” or that it would “improve [the] economic well-being of society (increased wealth).” + Support for free use or cheaper fares – some assembly members stated “make it free at point of use”, or “free public transport for all.” Others noted that “currently bus fares have gone up higher than inflation – instead it should be lower.” + “Improve wellness (increased health)” + “Massive drop in emissions”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  107  Cons − Experience – some assembly members felt that “free travel on buses is still not as nice as going in [a] car” or that it’s “got to be nicer than [going by] car before [it can] have an impact on CO2.” − Cost – some assembly members noted that “it has to be paid for” or disliked the “cost to [the] taxpayer.”  Some assembly members said they would support this policy “if [the] infrastructure is there/ readily available.”  Bringing public transport back under government control This would involve national government, local government or groups of local authorities controlling bus, tram and/or train services. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about bringing public transport back under government control.  Pros + Integration and planning – some assembly members suggested it “will enable the implementation of an integrated system”, would create “possibilities for [the] better integration of public transport” or “would allow all bus and rail networks to be integrated – improv[ing] connections and use.” Others said that “hopefully [those responsible would] get planning right i.e. [the] right hand [would] know what [the] left hand is doing.” + Better services – some assembly members said that “bringing public transport back under the control of government could result in better services” or that “public transport under government control [is] better than private, because it works.” + Price and payments – some assembly members suggested it is a “clear way to drop rail fairs and make it more affordable” or predicated there would be a “cost benefit to the user (private companies charge what they like).” Others said it “will improve consistency with price and could [lead to]… subsidised travel” or that “by putting public transport under Government, there can be a standardised payment system.” + Known to work – some assembly members described it as a “proven effective policy. European and other countries are well run.” Others said that it “works in London – we can use TfL model”, or that the “Dunkirk option is best.”10 + Less profit focussed – some assembly members said it meant “routes can be determined by necessity instead of profit” or that it would “help ‘less profitable’ routes.”  10  As previously noted, this referred back to a case study presented by one of the speakers, Lynn Sloman, during Weekend Two of the assembly.

It would also include segregated cycle lanes and cycle lanes outside urban areas. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about investing in cycling and scootering facilities.  Pros + Safety and accessibility – some assembly members said it “ensures cyclist safety”, that “safer cycling would improve accessibility for users” or that it would “mak[e] bikes safe [and people] more confident about riding a bike.” Others said it would be “safer for pedestrians and cyclists if cyclists have their own cycle super highways.” + Health benefits – some assembly members liked that it “has a huge benefit for health” or that “it is healthier for the public, reduces car use.” Some said there would be “positive health improvements IF done right – physical and mental.” + Meeting a need – some assembly members commented that “investing in cycle lane infrastructure is necessary to enable greater cycle use.” Others stated “joined up cycle lanes [are] needed”, “need storage” or “training is important = confidence and safety.” Some liked the idea of “safe places to store bikes when shopping/at work.” + Important – some assembly members said “it is as important [as] reading and writing!” or that “Councils must invest.” + “Would prefer more cycle lanes and pedestrian spaces than roads” + “Drop in emissions”  Cons − Cost and affordability – some assembly members disliked the “cost of implementing infrastructure for cycling”, suggesting “it costs £700k per 1km for the best cycle lanes.” Others said “local councils can’t afford to do it.” − “Would need to make new cycle lanes in all rural areas as it is quite dangerous to cycle there and this puts people off” − “Difficult to cycle in bad weather” − “Pay as you go may result in increased bike theft” − “Competition for limited road – bus/cycle lanes” − “Bike users should be made to take a proficiency test as quite a few are a danger on the road” − “Many cyclists refuse to use existing cycle lanes and insist on road use!” − “No health benefits if you are cycling next to traffic”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  110  Grants to buy electric bikes This could involve both a UK national grant scheme and local authorities offering grants to enable experimentation with different approaches. Grants of about £250 per e-bike are effective in other countries. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about grants to buy electric bikes.  Pros + Viable and affordable – some assembly members commented that “grants for e-bikes [are] large enough to be useful” or that it “makes buying an e-bike much more viable – grant money is very good in comparison to the average price.” Others said it “makes cycling more affordable for longer distances.” + Incentivising uptake – relatedly, others liked the “financial incentive for the general public to engage in cycling”, or said “grants are good – [they] encourage use of e-bikes.” Some suggested grants might result in people “getting a bike when you might not have thought about it before.” + “Encourages exercise” + “Really good if it benefits [those on] low incomes and people with health issues” + "Safer than racing bikes”  Cons − Safety – some assembly members worried about “safety for pedestrians (people cycle on pavements!)”, said “e-bikes [are] more dangerous than motorbikes in rural areas – e.g. for pedestrians”, or highlighted “increased risks to pedestrians, particularly [those who are] visually impaired and elderly.” − No impact on emissions? – some assembly members suggested e-bikes would “most likely only [be] bought for leisure – therefore no carbon decrease.” Others queried “will this really have much of an impact on emissions?” − Not possible for everyone – some assembly members noted “not everyone can” or said “even with grants [it’s] still too costly for low income families.” − “Subsidising manufactures” − “Insurance and licencing”  Some assembly members said the “grant has to be large enough to make a difference.”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  111  Additional ideas During their discussions about increasing the use of public and active transport, some assembly members noted additional suggestions:  “ Legislate for all schools to teach cycling” “ Make more guided bus and rail” systems to control/manage train routes” allowing for a greater bunching of trains “ Sensor and a reduction in delays. This would “replace any pollution if [the trains are] electric!” 11  buses” that have more sensors, for example to avoid the bunching of services “ Smart or automatically count passengers to know if extra buses are needed;  “ One ticket system with no penalty” “ There must be subsidies for low income areas and people” Others commented “this is all part of a joined up approach to transport – we like them all, so ranking [them on our ballot papers] is hard.”  Vote results Assembly members voted by secret ballot on the seven policy options for increasing the use of public and active transport. There were two ballot papers. The first ballot paper asked assembly members how much they agreed or disagreed that each policy option should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. The second ballot paper asked them to rank the options in their order of preference. The votes from this second ballot paper were counted both in terms of first preference votes and via Borda count. Assembly members supported a wide range of policies to increase the use of public and active transport. This is consistent with their earlier preferences for improvements in these areas (see Sections A and B above). Large majorities of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ that four of the policies should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. Levels of ‘strong agreement’ with these policies were high (at least 50% in all cases):  11    Adding new routes and more frequent services: 86% ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’, including 50% who ‘strongly agreed’;    Making public transport cheaper: 83% ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’, including 64% who ‘strongly agreed’;    Bringing public transport back under government control: 75% ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’, including 58% who ‘strongly agreed’;    Investing in cycling and scootering facilities: 70% ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’, including 53% who ‘strongly agreed’.  This is where buses or trains are guided automatically along a purpose-built track. The driver controls the speed. Guided buses are flexible in that they can also be driven on normal roads.  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  112  A majority of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ with the introduction of two further policies:   Investing in faster and more reliable buses: 66% ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’;    On-demand buses: 59% ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’.

However, a large percentage (36%) ‘didn’t mind’ or were ‘unsure’, leaving the percentage of those ‘agreeing’ or ‘strongly agreeing’ at just 42%. The ranking votes shed some additional light on assembly members’ views: all the policies about public transport (except on-demand buses) scored more highly than those about active transport.

Assembly members had already indicated support for moving quickly to low carbon vehicles and improving public transport. Their broad support for policies in these areas was consistent with that view (please see the table below). Conversely, many assembly members had been clear that they wanted to minimise restrictions on travel and lifestyles. Their comparative lack of support for policy options to discourage car ownership and use reaffirms that preference.  % Assembly members who agreed or disagreed with policy options % strongly agree or agree  % strongly disagree or disagree  Moving quickly to low carbon vehicles  91%  6%  Quickly stop selling the most polluting vehicles  Moving quickly to low carbon vehicles  86%  11%  Adding new bus routes and more frequent services  Increasing the use of public and active transport  86%  9%  Making public transport cheaper  Increasing the use of public and active transport  83%  14%  Bringing public transport back under government control  Increasing the use of public and active transport  75%  11%  Grants for businesses and people to buy low carbon cars  Moving quickly to low carbon vehicles  74%  9%  Localisation  Discouraging car ownership and use  72%  20%  Investing in cycling and scootering facilities  Increasing the use of public and active transport  70%  9%  Increasing investment to make buses faster and more reliable  Increasing the use of public and active transport  66%  9%  Car scrappage scheme  Moving quickly to low carbon vehicles  66%  9%  On-demand buses  Increasing the use of public and active transport  59%  22%  Car clubs  Discouraging car ownership and use  59%  11%  Advertising restrictions on the most polluting cars  Moving quickly to low carbon vehicles  58%  15%  Charging to use the roads  Discouraging car ownership and use  56%  39%  Closing roads to cars  Discouraging car ownership and use  53%  23%  Policy option  Policy objective  Government investment in low carbon buses and trains  Note: this table only includes policy options that at least 50% of assembly members supported  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  115  On moving quickly to low carbon vehicles, assembly members were particularly supportive of options to ‘quickly stop selling the most polluting vehicles’ and ‘government investment in low carbon buses and/or trains’. There was also significant support for ‘grants for businesses and people to buy low carbon cars’. Assembly members did not support ‘access to longer range cars for electric car owners’ or ‘lowering speed limits on dual carriageways or motorways.’ Assembly members’ rationale for their decisions included factors around:   Personal costs and affordability, including for those on low incomes;    Overall costs, who pays and who benefits;    Practicalities around implementation;    The impact on emissions;    And potential co-benefits.  Assembly members’ preferred options for increasing the use of public and active transport were: ‘making public transport cheaper’; ‘bringing public transport back under government control’; and ‘adding new bus routes and more frequent services’. They also backed the introduction of other policy initiatives. In general, assembly members were more supportive of policies to improve public – as opposed to active – transport. Assembly members did not support grants to buy electric bikes. Assembly members’ rationale for their decisions around public and active transport included a wish to see increased use of public transport, and considerations around cost (both personal and overall) and accessibility. For individual policies, impacts around safety, health and the ability to plan a better service were also important.  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  116  As already noted, assembly members were overall less supportive of policies to discourage car ownership and use. However a large majority of assembly members (72%) supported one policy option, ‘localisation’, with ‘closing roads to cars’ also performing well in the Borda count. Small majorities of assembly members supported two further policies, ‘charging to use the roads’ and ‘car clubs’. Assembly members’ rationale included whether or not they thought policies would benefit local areas including local high streets, and their potential impacts on people with low incomes, who live in rural areas and/or who have a disability.  D. Anything else to tell government or Parliament At the end of weekend three, assembly members had the opportunity to add any further thoughts on surface transport and the path to net zero. A small number of assembly members chose to add additional points. Some assembly members talked about the need for education and information:  “ Generic education in schools about carbon neutrality – kids now [are the] adults of 2030” “ Public information booklet – why important to take action and what” “ Focus on the provenance of information” Others focussed on synthetic fuels:  “ Consider other power sources apart from electricity (e.g. synthetic fuels)” long-term i.e. is electricity really the best? Should we go hydrogen/synthetic now? “ Think If freight going that way – don’t have 2 tier system – go for least disruptive tech” We have been demonising the wrong thing, it is fossil fuels that are the demon and “ yet we didn’t spent much time discussing alternative fuels. People like me love their cars…. Some of my grandchildren are learning to drive and love the experience. […] There is no need to take this away from people.” Others suggested a need to “consider implications for electricity generation/stability and power cuts”, provide “incentives to buy 2nd hand electric vehicles” and “address Amazon deliveries.”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  117  Conclusions Assembly members expressed clear and consistent views about surface transport and the path to net zero. Assembly members’ aimed to minimise restrictions on travel and lifestyles, placing the emphasis on shifting to electric vehicles and improving public transport, rather than on large reductions in car use. In terms of what the future of surface transport should look like in the UK, assembly members recommended:   A ban on the sale of new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars by 2030–2035;    A reduction in the amount we use cars by an average of 2–5% per decade;    Improved public transport.  In terms of how the UK should make these changes, assembly members considered policies aimed at moving quickly to low carbon vehicles, increasing public and active transport, and discouraging car ownership and use. A majority of assembly members backed12 fifteen policies:  12 13  14    Government investment in low carbon buses and trains (91%)    Quickly stop selling the most polluting vehicles (86%)    Adding new bus routes and more frequent services (86%)    Making public transport cheaper (83%)    Bringing public transport back under government control (75%)    Grants for businesses and people to buy low carbon cars (74%)    Localisation13 (72%)    Investing in cycling and scootering facilities (70%)    Increasing investment to make buses faster and more reliable (66%)    Car scrappage scheme (66%)    On-demand buses (59%)    Car clubs (59%)    Advertising restrictions on the most polluting cars (58%)    Charging to use the roads (56%)    Closing roads to cars14 (53%)  Figures given are for the % of assembly members who ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that a policy should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. The Expert Leads described ‘localisation’ as involving (1) changing regulations to ensure that new houses can only be built with good public transport links, and (2) including or putting back into local areas services such as post offices, local shops, health centres and schools. The Expert Leads described this as involving restricting cars in certain lanes, roads or zones. They said it could eventually mean that cars are not allowed in most town centres. There could also be temporary closures, such as regular car free days.  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  118  Overall assembly members were less supportive of policies to discourage car ownership and use, in-line with their vision for the future of surface transport in the UK. As well as the wish to minimise restrictions on lifestyles, assembly members’ rationale for their policy decisions included points around the speed of change, feasibility, practicalities, cost (both personal and overall), and co-benefits. They saw potential co-benefits as including improved air quality, reduced congestion and positive impacts for local areas and their high streets. Assembly members also consistently raised the importance of accessibility and affordability, stressing the need to avoid negative consequences for rural areas, people with a disability, and those on low incomes, as well as for mental health and isolation. Assembly members’ list of key considerations for government and Parliament to bear in mind when looking at surface transport (see Section A) provides an overarching framework within which to view the assembly’s decisions. It also includes a number of additional recommendations – for example, around information and education, who should pay for the changes needed, and avoiding potential side effects.  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel on land  119  Ch ap te r  4  How we travel by air  Summary of recommendations 1 Assembly members identified 14 considerations that they would like government and Parliament to bear in mind when looking at air travel and the path to net zero. These included speeding up progress on technology, influencing the rest of the world, and evening out the cost of air travel versus alternative forms of transport by making the latter cheaper and better. 2 Assembly members would like to see a solution to air travel emissions that allows people to continue to fly. Assembly members felt that this would protect people’s freedom and happiness, as well as having benefits for business and the economy. However their support for continued flying had limits. Assembly members resoundingly rejected a future in which air passenger numbers would rise by as much as 65% between 2018 and 2050, labelling it “counterproductive”. Instead, assembly members sought to find an acceptable balance between achieving the net zero target, impacts on lifestyles, reliance on new technologies, and investment in alternatives. Their preferences point to a future in which:   1  Air passenger numbers increase by 25–50% between 2018 and 2050, depending on how quickly technology progresses. This is a lower rate of growth per year than was seen in recent times1 prior to Covid-19;    30m tonnes of CO2 is still emitted by the aviation sector in 2050 and requires removing from the atmosphere;    There is investment in alternatives to air travel.  3 80% of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that taxes that increase as people fly more often and as they fly further should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. Assembly members saw these taxes as fairer than alternative policy options. 4 Assembly members would like to see the airline industry invest in greenhouse gas removals. 75% of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that this should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. There was also significant support for financial incentives from government to encourage a wide range of organisations to invest. Assembly members’ tended to feel that ‘the polluter should pay’, although some suggested a need to monitor, scrutinise and perhaps enforce airline industry investment to ensure it actually takes place. 5 87% of assembly members strongly agreed that we need to invest in the development and use of new technologies for air travel. These technologies could include electric aircraft and synthetic fuels.  A 25–50% increase between 2018 and 2050 is equivalent to a growth in passenger numbers of between 0.7% and 1.3% per year. Between 2000 and 2018, the annual rate of growth in passenger numbers was 2.8%. Department for Transport (2019) Aviation Statistics: data table AVI0101: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/aviation-statistics-data-tables-avi  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel by air  121  How we travel by air Air travel accounts for 22% of the UK’s total greenhouse gas emissions from transport, and 7% of the UK’s total greenhouse gas emissions overall.2 Emissions from flying have grown significantly in the last 30 years.3 Air travel’s contribution to UK emissions comes from both:   Domestic travel – travel within the borders of the UK; and    International travel – travel that starts in the UK but ends in another country. 96% of the UK’s air travel emissions are from international flights.4  Excluded from these figures are flights from other countries to the UK (for example, return flights from holidays), or travel that UK residents take within other countries or from one foreign country to another. Climate Assembly UK followed the same criteria when deciding what was, and was not, in scope for its discussions. Air travel also includes both passenger or ‘personal’ transport, and freight. Personal transport is what people use to travel for pleasure, like going on holiday or visiting family and friends. It also covers travel for work. Freight is transport used to move goods. Climate Assembly UK considered personal transport only. It did not look at freight.5 This followed guidance from Parliament that, if there was not time to consider both, its committees most wanted to hear assembly members’ views on personal transport.  What did the assembly consider? Thirty-six assembly members considered the topic of air travel in-depth. We selected these assembly members from the assembly as a whole using random stratified sampling. This ensured that they remained reflective of the wider UK population in terms of both demographics6 and their level of concern about climate change.  2 3 4 5 6  BEIS (2019) Final UK greenhouse gas emissions national statistics 1990–2017.

Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel by air  122  These assembly members heard a wide range of views both on what the future of air travel could look like for the UK, and how we might move towards that future. They had the opportunity to question each speaker7 in detail. These evidence sessions took place at weekend two of the assembly. Assembly members spent weekend three of the assembly discussing the evidence they had heard and their own views, before reaching recommendations on three separate areas: A.  Considerations: the overarching considerations that government and Parliament should bear in mind when making decisions about air travel and the path to net zero;  B.  Futures: what the future of air travel in the UK should look like;  C.  Policy options: how the UK should move toward this future.  Assembly members also had the opportunity to discuss and add anything else they wanted to say to government and Parliament about air travel and the path to net zero. Assembly members’ views on the implications of Covid-19 for this topic are touched on in Chapter 10.  Contents of this chapter A. Considerations  page 124  B.

All speakers’ presentations are available as slides, videos and transcripts at climateassembly.uk/resources/. An ‘informant’ is a speaker who we asked to cover the range of views and available evidence on a topic. An ‘advocate’ is a speaker who we asked to give their own view, or the view of their organisation. Assembly members knew whether speakers were informants or advocates.  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel by air  123  A. Considerations Assembly members reached their first decisions on air travel by discussing their answers to the following question: What considerations should government and Parliament bear in mind when making decisions about air travel and the path to net zero? Assembly members thought about their answers to this question individually. They then discussed their views in small groups at their tables, with each table agreeing their five top considerations. These top considerations had to, between them, represent the range of views at the table. Facilitators took the top considerations from each table and grouped similar options together to create a list on which assembly members could vote. They checked this list back with assembly members to make sure they had accurately reflected their views. This included making any necessary adjustments. Each assembly member voted for the four options that they felt to be most important. The results were as follows. The wording of the considerations in the table is either word for word what assembly members wrote on their option cards or, where facilitators combined similar options from several tables, how they described the options to assembly members prior to the vote.  Rank  Consideration  % assembly members who chose it as a priority  1  Taken together, the following two considerations had the most votes:  53  •  25  •  Escalate and speed up options to enable us to keep flying (e.g. technology, synthetic fuels, carbon offsetting)  28  Speed up technology (e.g. electric planes, synthetic fuels) but don’t jump in before ready and don’t compromise safety  =2  Influence the rest of the world (USA and China) – e.g. tax on aviation fuel needs to be worldwide  50  =2  Even out the costs of air travel compared to alternatives by making alternatives cheaper and better, including increasing capacity to cater for increased demand  50  4  Frequent fliers and those that fly more distance should pay more  44  =5  Stay competitive and protect the economy, including addressing the impact on business and the travel industry  31  =5  Engage the population in making the necessary changes (education, promotion, explanation)  31  7  Take account of different travel needs (e.g. people with family far away, the military, people who live on islands, medical needs)  25  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel by air  124  =8  Promote and incentivise UK holidays  22  =8  Scrap incentives to make people fly more (e.g. air miles, 1st class)  22  10  Ban polluting private jets and helicopters, moving to electric technology as it becomes available  19  =11  Ensure choices are accessible and affordable to all sections of society  14  =11  Don’t limit how much individuals travel  14  13  Even out the costs of air travel compared to alternatives by making air travel more expensive  8  14  Make those who take more expensive modes pay more (i.e. in carbon tax), including those who use private jets  3  Note: It is worth noting that, taken together, the options about evening out the costs of air travel compared to alternatives would have the most votes. These options came joint second and thirteenth in the vote, respectively. However it is possible that some assembly members voted for both these options, which is why they are not combined in the table above. This is not the case for the options that came first, where assembly members agreed prior to the vote that they could only vote for one of them.  B. Futures After deciding their most important considerations, assembly members moved on to look at the future of air travel for the UK. To aid them in this process, the Expert Leads presented assembly members with five scenarios for possible futures:   Technological change;    More emissions from flying;    Flying less;    Combined approach;    Flying less until technology improves.  Together these scenarios cover a broad range of views about how air travel could change to help the UK reach net zero. Each scenario presented to assembly included a different combination of assumptions about:   How much to reduce the amount we fly, by for example: —  Taking fewer holidays and business trips, including using video conferencing;  —  Shifting shorter flights to other forms of transport such as high speed rail or ferries;  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel by air  125    How quickly we are able to make planes more efficient and develop new engine technologies, for example electric aircraft;    How quickly we are able to shift from fossil fuels to biofuels and synthetic fuels;    The quantity of greenhouse gas emissions remaining from air travel in 2050 that will need removing from the atmosphere to meet the net zero target.8, 9  Assembly members discussed each of the scenarios or ‘possible futures’, before voting on them by secret ballot. We start by presenting the rationale for their views, taking each possible future in turn.  Jump to the vote results on page 135  B.1 Technological change This future would see increased air travel, with technology used to reduce emissions. It would feature:   A 50% growth in air passenger numbers between 2018 and 2050;10    A higher rate of technology progress than in some other scenarios, leading to improved fuel efficiency;    A high use of low carbon fuels (25% of fuel by 2050);    Some hybrid electric aircraft by 2050;    Emissions in 2050 that are lower than today, amounting to approximately 30m tonnes of CO2 per year. These remaining 30m tonnes of CO2 would need to be removed from the atmosphere.  Assembly members discussed this possible future in small groups. They identified the following pros and cons.  8  9 10  Even if technologies and policies to move towards net zero are successful, it is very likely that there will still be emissions from flying in 2050: emissions from flying have grown significantly in the last 30 years; new technologies and fuels that could substantially reduce emissions – such as synthetic fuels and electric aircraft – are at an early stage of development and their future impact on emissions is uncertain. For the assembly’s recommendations on how to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, please see Chapter 9. A 50% growth in passenger numbers between 2018 and 2050 is in line with the Department for Transport’s central forecast, which assumes that airport capacity is not expanded.

People will have to get “ onEvery with that.” “ We have to set an example.” When we asked assembly members to rank the possible futures in their order of preference, this future received significant support from assembly members. Please see page 135 for the vote results.  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel by air  127  B.2 More emissions from flying This possible future would involve continued growth in air travel. It would feature:   A 65% growth in air passenger numbers between 2018 and 2050;11    Expansion of airport capacity to enable this growth;    Some technology progress to improve fuel efficiency;    Limited use of low carbon fuels and electric aircraft by 2050;    Emissions in 2050 that are higher than today, amounting to approximately 50m tonnes of CO2 per year. These remaining 50m tonnes of CO2 would need to be removed from the atmosphere. Greenhouse gas removal measures would be needed more rapidly than in the other futures.  Assembly members discussed this possible future at their tables. A few individual assembly members noted positive points about this future. However, the majority of assembly members focused on its negatives.  11  A 65% growth in passenger numbers between 2018 and 2050 is similar to the assumption made in a recent decarbonisation roadmap published by an airline industry body called Sustainable Aviation in early 2020. [source: https://www.sustainableaviation.co.uk/news/uk-aviation-commits-to-net-zero-carbon-emissions-by-2050/]  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel by air  128  Pros + “Allows airway companies to make more money” + “Can concentrate on other aspects of net zero” + “Growth in economy / standard of life”  Cons − Backwards step – some assembly members commented that this future would be a “backwards approach”, “counter intuitive”, or “counterproductive.” Others said there was “too great a rise in air passenger numbers.” − Too great a reliance on removals – some assembly members felt removals are “too expensive” or “rel[y] on …methods that we don’t currently have.” Others said that it “makes sense to reduce emissions rather than have to remove them.” − Knock of effect on other areas of CO2 reduction – some assembly members noted concerns that this future would mean a need to reduce emissions more, and/or more quickly, in other areas like the home and surface transport. They felt this could cause problems. − “Every sector has to play its part” − “Undesirable consequences of increased airport capacity” − “Limits development in technology”  One assembly member said they would support this possible future if it included more technological change in order to reduce carbon emissions further. When we asked assembly members to rank the possible futures in their order of preference, this scenario received almost no support from assembly members. The only assembly member who chose this option as their first preference commented: keep up with global growth and life expectations air travel will increase irrespective “ To of UK policy. All options presented require carbon capture anyway….” Please see below for the results of the vote.  B.3 Flying less This possible future would involve reducing air travel. It would feature:   A 15% reduction in air passenger numbers between 2018 and 2050;    No expansion of airport capacity;    Investment in high speed rail and alternatives to business travel;  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel by air  129    A higher rate of technology progress leading to improved fuel efficiency;    Moderate use of low carbon fuels and hybrid electric aircraft;    Emissions in 2050 that are lower than today, amounting to approximately 20m tonnes of CO2 per year. These remaining 20m tonnes of CO2 would need to be removed from the atmosphere  Assembly members discussed this possible future at their tables. They identified the following pros and cons.  Pros + Reduced air travel and emissions – some assembly members supported the “reduction in air passengers” or said this future was the “only option that reduces air travel and emissions.” + Cheap and easy – some assembly members said that this was “the cheapest and easiest way to reduce emissions” or that they were “not convinced about feasibility / viability of carbon capture.” + Positive for alternatives – some assembly members liked the idea of “investment in high speed rail” or “improved public transport.” + Helping UK tourism – one assembly member noted that this future would be positive for “Holiday UK.” + “Achievable if people are educated about climate change” + “Immediate benefits of less flying” + “Reducing local flights is positive” + “Can be done fairly”  Cons − Damage to business and the economy – some assembly members labelled this future a “15% reduction in competitiveness of the UK economy” or said “flying less does not benefit businesses.” Others said “no expansion of airports is two steps backwards for the UK.” − Restricts people’s freedom and limits their happiness – some assembly members said that this future would “reduc[e] personal freedoms/rewards” or “may damage people’s happiness.” − Not realistic or practical – some assembly members voiced concerns about the “need to improve alternatives very quickly” or “the very significant changes in lifestyle” required. − “Big Brother” – some assembly members did not like the idea of lifestyle decisions being made for them, with one assembly member commenting “life change? Who decides? How?” − “If we have to take 20mt/pa12 out of atmosphere, we might as well take 50mt/pa out”  12  ‘Mt/pa’ refers to million tonnes of CO2 per year.  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel by air  130  When we asked assembly members to rank the possible futures in their order of preference, this scenario received support from some assembly members. Assembly members who chose this as their first preference made a range of comments including:  “ Serious attempt to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.” future with reduction in air passengers over the period – most direct solution “ Only to reduce emissions instead of methods that increase emissions that then need to be captured – when technology does not seem reliable or all figured out yet.”  “ People staying in the UK and spending in UK.” Please see below for the results of the vote.  B.4 Combined approach This scenario would involve slower growth in air travel than has been the case in recent years, alongside the use of some new technologies and fuels. They noted that it would feature:   A 25% growth in air passenger numbers between 2018 and 2050;    Investment in high speed rail and alternatives to business travel;    A higher rate of technology progress compared to some of the other futures, leading to improved fuel efficiency;    Moderate use of low carbon fuels and hybrid electric aircraft;    Emissions in 2050 that are lower than today, amounting to approximately 30m tonnes of CO2 per year. These remaining 30m tonnes of CO2 would need to be removed from the atmosphere.  Assembly members discussed this possible future at their tables. They identified the following pros and cons.  Pros + “Allows an acceptable best of both worlds” – some assembly members felt this future “target[s] all aspects of the problem but allow[s] growth”. Others noted that it would make “emissions lower,” whilst being “not a drastic change in lifestyle.” + More achievable – some assembly members commented that “growth in air passengers cannot suddenly stop.” + Public appeal – some assembly members felt that this future is “likely to appeal to most people” or “can enable a ground swell of support.” + Investment in alternatives – for example, some assembly members voiced their support for high speed rail. + “Use of technology as part of the solution”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel by air  131  Cons − Unachievable – some assembly members commented that the “slower growth in air travel [is] not possible to achieve.” − Doubts about technology – some assembly members felt that “the technology is still uncertain and unproven.” − Amount of CO2 removal – some assembly members were concerned about the “very high requirement for CO2 removal.” − Lacks ambition – some assembly members felt this future was “just a slower version of ‘fly less until technology improves’.” − “Too pessimistic”  One assembly member suggested that this scenario “requires a lot of education to make it work”. When we asked assembly members to rank the possible futures in their order of preference, this scenario received significant support from assembly members. Please see page 135 for the vote results.  B.5 Flying less until technology improves This scenario would involve reducing air travel until new technologies become available.13 It would feature:   A 20% growth in air passenger numbers between 2018 and 2050;    Investment in high speed rail and alternatives to business travel;    Moderate technology progress, leading to improved fuel efficiency;    Low carbon fuels commercially available in 2035. They supply a third of air travel by 2050;    Emissions in 2050 that are lower than today, amounting to approximately 20m tonnes of CO2 per year. These remaining 20m tonnes of CO2 would need to be removed from the atmosphere.  Assembly members discussed this possible future at their tables. They identified the following pros and cons.  13  The Expert Leads developed this scenario as a direct response to comments made by assembly members at weekend two of the assembly.  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel by air  132  Pros + Reduction in emissions – some assembly members commented that this future had the “lowest emissions of all options” or that “emissions [would be] significantly reduced.” + “Gives a chance for technology to catch-up” – some assembly members suggested that this involved a “gradual introduction of alternatives – not rushed.” Others felt it “would be good in the short-term, but not a long-term solution. Still need new technology as soon as possible.” + Investment in alternatives – for example, some assembly members voiced their support for high speed rail. + Best of all worlds – one assembly member noted that this future “includes investment [in alternatives], development of technology and still continued growth [in air passenger numbers].” + “Realistic”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel by air  133  Cons − Restrictions on flying – some assembly members said that “restricting flying in any way should not be encouraged” or that this future “reduces personal freedoms/rewards” or “impacts on lifestyles.” − Not enough reliance on technology – some assembly members felt that “progress should be quicker” particularly on low carbon fuels or that this future “removes incentives for on-going progression on technology.” − Too much reliance on technology – some assembly were concerned about the reliance on technology: “What if technology doesn’t develop enough and we’ve waited too long to do anything?” “Is it realistic to improve technology significantly by 2035?” − Impact on businesses – one assembly member noted that there would be a “change in lifestyle in [the] short to medium term with possible impacts on some businesses.” − High speed rail – one assembly member suggested that high speed rail “can be disruptive and environmentally damaging.” − “Politicians will sit on it! Change won’t happen”  A number of assembly members made additional comments about this possible future. They suggested that:   15 years is too long to wait for low carbon fuels to be commercially available, and that there should be more emphasis on technology;    The cost of carbon offsetting should be paid for from a levy or taxation on aviation;    There should be a ban on private jets and helicopters, first and business class flights and non-essential air freight, as “an easy way to reduce emissions”;    “We can’t be building new airports and runways while committed to reducing emissions.”  One assembly member also asked whether electrical long–haul recharge platforms are a possibility. When we asked assembly members to rank the possible futures in their order of preference, this scenario received support from some assembly members. Please see below for the results of the vote.  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel by air  134  Vote results Assembly members voted on the possible futures by secret ballot. The ballot paper asked them to rank the futures in their order of preference. The votes were counted in two ways:   Counting assembly members’ first preference votes only. This tells us what assembly members would and wouldn’t choose if they could have their preferred future.    Using Borda count. This involves allocating points for preferences – a first preference vote scored four points, a second preference vote 3 points and so on. A fifth preference vote scored no points. Counting the votes like this tells us which futures are most acceptable to the greatest number of assembly members.  Figure 1: Possible futures  Please rank the possible futures in order of preference (% 1st preference votes) % 40  39%  20  19%  22% 17%  3% 0 Technological change  More emissions from flying  Flying less  Combined approach  Flying less until technology improves  ‘Technological change’ received significantly more first preference votes than the other futures. ‘More emissions from flying’ received almost no votes. A majority of assembly members (58%) chose as their first preference a future that would see passenger numbers rise by just 15–25% by 2050 – a much lower figure than the 50% increase under ‘technological change’. Assembly members who chose ‘technological change’ as their first preference wrote a range of reasons for their choice on their ballot papers, including: it is most sensible to push for an advance in technology because other ideas seem “ toI think just be putting off or avoiding the problems, instead of trying to solve them.”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel by air  135  Has a reasonable level of CO emissions … which may be achievable to remove “ from the atmosphere.” 2  “ Freedom of movement is important to me.” “ It seems the most realistic and practical solution – as we are an island people need to fly.” “ Most socially acceptable option.” “ It also still allows a high growth level which is important to the economy and businesses.” the answer to all the problems in relation to emissions (within aviation) lies “ inI believe technology.” In the Borda count, ‘technological change’ and ‘combined approach’ received almost identical scores. ‘More emissions from flying’ again scored poorly.  Figure 2: Possible futures  Please rank the possible futures in order of preference (Borda count) 100  99  99  80 60  73  64  40 20 0  22 Technological change  More emissions from flying  Flying less  Combined approach  Flying less until technology improves  Assembly member who chose ‘combined approach’ as their first preference gave a range of reasons for their choice. This included a feeling that this future is ‘balanced’, with some noting their support for investment in alternative forms of transport. Comments included: passenger growth with investment into surface transports. And a reasonable “ Combines amount (30 m tonnes) of CO to be removed.” 2  Emissions lower, alternatives to flying being invested in so not forcing people to “ completely stop travelling – not a very drastic change in lifestyle. Most realistic option as growth in air passengers cannot suddenly stop.”  “ Seems obvious to make best efforts on all fronts including some small behaviour change.”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel by air  136  “ Overall the investment in high speed rail. And higher rate of technology.” “ Most achievable and likely to be acceptable to the majority.” Futures – conclusions Overall, assembly members’ preferred futures were ‘technological change’ and the ‘Combined approach’, with the former securing substantially more first preference votes (39% to 22%). Comments in group discussions and on their ballot papers suggest that assembly members’ reasons for supporting ‘Technological change’ centred on a wish for a solution to air travel emissions that allows people to continue to fly. They cited rationale including freedom and happiness for this preference, as well as – to a slightly lesser extent – benefits to business and the economy. Some assembly members expressed scepticism about the feasibility of significant changes to passenger numbers. Assembly members’ support for continued flying did, however, have limits:   The scenario that included the greatest increase in air passenger numbers (‘more emissions from flying’) secured just 3% of first preference votes and received least support by a considerable margin in the Borda count. Assembly members suggested that it would be “counterproductive”, involved too great a reliance on greenhouse gas removals, and would have knock-on effects in terms of requiring greater change in other areas of people’s lives;    While ‘technological change’ was clearly the most popular scenario in terms of first preference votes, a majority of assembly members (58%) chose as their first preference a future that would see passenger numbers rise by just 15–25% by 2050 – a much lower figure than the 50% increase included under ‘technological change’. Some assembly members expressed uncertainty about when fuel and technological improvements would be ready. Others highlighted the benefits of flying less, for example for reducing emissions.  This split in first preference votes makes the Borda count results particularly instructive. They suggest that the two scenarios that large numbers of assembly members could live with, even if they were not their first preference, are ‘technological change’ and the ‘Combined approach.’ For some assembly members the latter offered “an acceptable best of both worlds” that was likely to be more achievable and acceptable to the public, and which included investment in alternative forms of transport. Taken together, these two scenarios suggest a future in which:   Air passenger numbers increase by 25–50% between 2018 and 2050, depending on how quickly technology progresses;    30m tonnes of CO2 is still emitted by the aviation sector in 2050 and requires removing from the atmosphere.  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel by air  137  C. Policy options After considering what the future of air travel in the UK would be, assembly members moved on to consider how we might get there. Specifically they looked at policy options in two areas: 1.  Managing the amount we fly;  2.  Ensuring investment in greenhouse gas removals.  For each of these areas, the Expert Leads recapped and explained potential policy options. Assembly members discussed these ideas in their groups before voting by secret ballot. They were also able to make additional suggestions for steps that could be taken. During their discussions, assembly members requested an opportunity to vote on: 3.  Investment in the development and use of new technologies.  The results of this vote are also included below.  C.1 Managing the amount we fly During the discussions, some assembly members asked for an additional option to be added to the ballot paper: “Taxes that increase as people fly more often and as they fly further.” The Expert Leads accepted this request. Assembly members looked at two options for managing the amount we fly:14   A carbon tax on all flights;    Taxes that increase as people fly more often.  During the discussions, some assembly members asked for an additional option to be added to the ballot paper:   Taxes that increase as people fly more often and as they fly further.  We accepted this request.15 This section starts by presenting the rationale for assembly members’ views, taking each policy option in turn.  Jump to the vote results on page 143  14  15  Other policies that could have been included here – for example no further airport expansion or investment in alternatives to flying – were embedded in some of the possible futures covered in Section B. Support for the development and use of new technology was also covered separately in a later vote (please see page 153). These options therefore focus on taxation. Assembly members did not discuss this option in-depth because it was added so close in to the vote. We are therefore unable to include a full rationale for assembly members’ views about it. However, their comments on the other two policy options, shed considerable light on why assembly members wanted it included.  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel by air  138  A carbon tax on all flights This would involve replacing the current tax on flights16 with a carbon tax based on the amount of CO2 emitted for each passenger. The carbon tax paid could be varied by cabin class, although it would not have to be. For example, business class passengers could be asked to pay a higher amount. Assembly members identified a number of pros, cons and conditions about a carbon tax on all flights. Conditions are measures that some assembly members said would need to be in place for them to support this policy option.  Pros + Direct relationship to carbon emissions – some assembly members liked that it “reflects carbon emission on specific travel” or “directly relate[s] to CO2 emissions.” + Fairer – some assembly members suggested it is “a fairer way to tax users and airlines.” Others liked that “you would be taxed at use.” + The right thing to do – some assembly members commented that “it is right people should pay more” or said “we need to reduce emissions. We need to reduce flying.” + Simple – some assembly members felt this option was “simple to administer” or would be the “easiest to implement and manage.” + Vary tax by cabin class – some assembly members supported the idea of “vary[ing] tax by cabin class.” + Encouraging efficiency – some assembly members said “it may encourage efficiency if they [flights] become more expensive.”  Cons − Impact on people with lower incomes – several assembly member expressed concerns that the “significant increase in flight cost” would have a “disproportionate effect on [people with] lower incomes.” Similar comments included: “Will low incomes be able to afford their one holiday a year?” “Price out lower incomes” “Cost of flying could increase to the point only the wealthy can fly.” Others labelled it a “non progressive tax” or said it “discriminates more against poor people.” Some assembly members felt the “rich will still be able to pay” or asked “what level of disincentive [is needed] before [the] richest stop flying?”  16  The current tax is called Air Passenger Duty. It does not reflect the impact of air travel on climate change because the rates of tax do not reflect the emissions produced.  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel by air  139  − Unfair and too blunt – some assembly members disliked that it “will make everyone’s flights more expensive” or “put the cost of flying up for everyone”, with some suggesting this was “not fair.” Others noted that “15% of people take 70% of flights.” Others branded it “too blunt an instrument” with “disproportionate effects.” − Increase in cost to passengers – some assembly members suggested that “it significantly increases the cost of flying” or is a “high tax.” Others predicted that the “cost [would be] passed on to [the] passenger” or said they were “afraid [we would] end up with air passenger tax plus carbon tax.” − Restricting – some assembly members said it would “restric[t] choice” or that there would be “less flights.” − Lead to slower improvement in technology – some assembly members suggested it would lead to “less in revenues and therefore investment in technologies” or said that a “tax on fuel will drive more efficiency.” − Education – some assembly members said reduced flying would mean “not learning about different cultures.” Others said that “education will suffer.” − Avoidance – some assembly members felt it would be “difficult or impossible to prevent avoidance”, with some suggesting overseas connections could be used in that way. − “Increasing taxes will discourage world trade for UK PLC” − “It will affect me negatively” − “Low cost airlines may make UK less efficient planes”  Conditions → Where the money goes – some assembly members said they would support a carbon tax if revenues were “ringfenced”, “ringfenced for technology development” or “dependent on where money goes – i.e. investment in new technology fuels etc.” Others asked “can we make government invest in technologies and not anything else (ringfence)?” → Transparency and trust – some assembly members said it would be “okay if there is transparency” or that we would “need a trustworthy way of calculating carbon per flight.” → Being more targeted – some assembly members suggested that you “would need to consider exemptions for special cases”, or that “there is a distinction to be made between family and business.” Others asked “what are the tax implications for children flying?”  In the voting, a carbon tax on all flights received some support from assembly members. Please see below for the results of the vote.  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel by air  140  Taxes that increase as people fly more often This would involve replacing air passenger duty with a tax that increases as people fly more often. This could be done so that people who only fly once in a year pay no tax. The tax paid could also be varied by cabin class although it would not have to be. For example, business class passengers could be asked to pay a higher amount. Assembly members identified a number of pros, cons and conditions about taxes that increase as people fly more often.  Pros + Fairer – several assembly members commented on “fairness”. For example: “Penalise people who travel a lot – fairer to those who don’t.” “Targets the 15% who take 70% of the flights.” “It is fairer. Those who pollute more, pay more of it. Doesn’t disproportionately affect low income people.” “I really like this option. I think it’s fair.” “Seems fair for people who have less.” “Fairer to passengers.” “Like the escalator aspect.” + “Could potentially persuade people not to take less needed flights or find alternatives (e.g. train)” + “Vary tax by cabin class” + “Likely to be more acceptable to more people”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel by air  141  Cons − Doesn’t reflect distance flown – some assembly members disliked that it “doesn’t take into account distance” or suggested that “this wouldn’t be fair if one person’s long-haul flight for the year is free – but if someone takes 3 short haul flights they have to pay.” Others asked “what if your first flight of the year is short haul, and the second is long haul – is the charge reflective in any way?” − Too blunt – some assembly members felt it would be “disproportionate to certain groups (families)” or would “penalise family relationships.” Others asked “would there be exemptions for essential flyers – e.g. surgeons?” or suggested that it “needs safeguards and conditions built in.” − “People travelling a lot will be from a higher income background, so will continue to fly regardless” − “Variable rate of tax applied makes prices uncertain” − “Increases cost of flying for some people” − “Reduces incentive for airlines to decrease CO2”  Conditions → Where the money goes – some assembly members said their support would be “dependent on where money goes – i.e. investment in new technology, fuels etc” or that they would support it “if [the income was] ringfenced.” → Exemptions for certain groups – picking up one of the points from the ‘cons’ list, some said policy-makers “would need to consider exemptions for special cases” or asked “what are the tax implications for children flying?” → “Companies will have to pay the levy for their workers’ business flights” → One assembly member said they would support this option if the number of miles someone flew was also taken into consideration  In the voting, taxes that increase as people fly more often received significant support from assembly members. However they did not receive as much support as taxes that increase as people fly more often and as they fly further. Please see page 143 for the vote results.  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel by air  142  Additional ideas Assembly members raised a number of additional ideas for policy options in this area:  “ We could have both (with a smaller fairer carbon tax and higher frequent flyer levy)” “ Escalating carbon tax depending on how often you fly” “ Tax on fuel will drive more efficiency” One assembly member commented “we are having to vote on tax – are there other options?! Tax by back door.”17  Vote results Assembly members voted by secret ballot on policy options for managing the amount we fly. There were two ballot papers. The first ballot paper asked assembly members how much they agreed or disagreed that each policy option should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. The second ballot paper asked them to rank the options in their order of preference. The votes from this second ballot paper were counted both in terms of first preference votes and via Borda count. A majority of assembly members ‘agreed’ or ‘strongly agreed’ that all the policy options should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. However some policy options were clearly much more supported than others. The most popular option was ‘taxes that increase as people fly more often and as they fly further.’ 81% of assembly members ‘agreed’ or ‘strongly agreed’ that this should be part of how the UK gets to net zero, with an outright majority of 65% strong agreeing. This was followed by “taxes that increase as people fly more often (70% ‘agreed’ or ‘strongly agreed’), with a carbon tax on all flights (59%) bringing up the rear. A carbon tax on all flights also received much lower levels of strong support than the other options – 15%, compared to 35% and 65% respectively. The results of the preference votes paint a similar picture. ‘Taxes that increase as people fly more often and as they fly further’ was by some distance the most popular option in terms of both first preference votes and the Borda count. A carbon tax on all flights remained the least popular option, again by some margin.  17  Please see footnote 14 on page 138.

We start by presenting the rationale for their views, taking each policy option in turn.  Jump to the vote results on page 151  Airline industry invests This policy option would give the airline industry responsibility for investing in greenhouse gas removal measures to balance out remaining emissions from air travel. Assembly members identified a number of pros, cons and conditions relating to this policy option.  Pros + The polluter pays – some assembly members felt that the “industry that causes the problem should fix it”. Comments included: “The people causing the problem are responsible for the solution.” “Makes industry responsible for its own carbon.” “Since they are the ones contributing, they should have the responsibility to consider the removals or at least consider putting [in] less in the first place.” “Airline industry must take responsibility to capture their pollution and emissions. They must pay the true cost.” + Incentivising technological change – some assembly members suggested it would provide an “incentive to make improvements quickly”, would “incentivise the industry to change” or would “encourage innovation by the industry.” Others felt it “would prompt airlines to invest in new technology and cleaner planes.” + Targeted – some assembly members suggested it would have “no impact on people that don’t fly” or that it would “not [be] costing [the] general taxpayer.” + “They will add to tickets which will change behaviour” + “Possible to do by passing legislation” + “Leave everything else to free market” (note: one assembly member countered this by suggesting “it isn’t a free market; routes are set by government”)  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel by air  146  Cons − Whether it would work – a significant number of assembly members expressed scepticism about whether it would work. Some simply queried “not possible?” Others talked about: − Trustworthiness and monitoring – for example, some assembly members suggested there would be “high pressure on [the] airline industry to overstate/overestimate effectiveness of carbon capture – would result in untrustworthy figures.” Others said “monitoring and enforcement would be needed” or asked: “How would this be implemented? How can we monitor what they do?” or “How will the money be spent or regulated to ensure they do?” − Willingness – some assembly members suggested that “airlines may refuse [to invest] and move business outside the UK.” Others said that it “seem[s] …an impossible task to persuade worldwide organisations – turkey voting for Christmas.” − Practicalities – some assembly members felt that the “‘airline industry’ is too diverse to do connected up research.” − Need for international agreement – some assembly members noted that “it’s an international industry” or said “there will have to be agreements with more places abroad because of international flights.” Some asked “what will happen if we don’t get agreement with other countries.” − Not joined-up – some assembly members disliked that it is a “non-integrated approach” that doesn’t include “other sectors” beyond air travel. Similar others commented: “Doesn’t take other carbon emissions into account (not other sectors).”  Conditions → “Investment in greenhouse gas removals” → “Needs scrutiny by a third party to ensure removal is done right” → “Matching investments need to be monitored – public money must not make private profit” → “Must be only the funding generated by receipts from 1a [carbon tax on all flights] or 1b [taxes that increase as people fly more often].”  In the voting, this option received significant support from assembly members. Please see below for the results of the vote.  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel by air  147  Government invests This policy option would involve the government investing in greenhouse gas removal measures to balance out remaining emissions and ensure the net zero target is met. This would include emissions not just from air travel but also from other sectors likely to have remaining emissions in 2050, such as farming. Assembly members identified a number of pros, cons and conditions about this policy option.  Pros + Effective – some assembly members suggested it is a “good way to get it sorted” or that we are “hopefully more likely to reach net zero if [it’s] under government investment.” + Positive about where the investment would go – some assembly members said the “Government should fund: universities, research industries and manufacturers to do research” or “invest in training in GHG [greenhouse gas] technology.” + “Demonstrates commitment of government to reduce greenhouse emissions” + “You can see directly who you are holding responsible / accountable” + “Match funding for business investment (to x%)” + “Needs properly validated / audited carbon capture effectiveness measures. Think that only government has the credibility to produce accurate validated figures” + “Government can introduce measures across all sectors”  Cons − Unfair on people who don’t fly – some assembly members said that “people who don’t fly may object to government money being spent on the effects of the air industry.” There were also several comments suggesting that “general taxation [is] not fair on those who don’t fly.” − Could / would government do it – some assembly members suggested that it was “too expensive for the government to manage on its own” or that “changes in governments may affect decisions taken.” Others felt that “big business [is] behind this. Biggest funders of [the] current government have [a] vested interest in this.” Some felt it is “beyond the wit of government.” − Lack of effort from business – some assembly members disliked that there is “no onus on airline companies”, or that we would be “subsiding an industry behaving badly.” − “Non-entrepreneurial” − “Not in favour of tax onus” − “Unclear where funding comes from” − “Knock on effect on other areas in need of investment”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel by air  148  Conditions → “The government have a responsibility but the taxation must not hurt the least well off” → “Government should support and invest in organisations’ and researchers’ contribution but responsibility should not fall completely on them because it would not teach the individuals of their effects” → “Government / Parliament can find [a] combination of ways to fund – worldwide approach / unfound so far”  In the voting, government investment received less support than the other policy options.  A wide range of organisations invest This policy option would involve the government overseeing financial incentives to organisations that invest in greenhouse gas removal measures. This would include emissions not just from air travel but also from other sectors likely to have remaining emissions in 2050, such as farming. It could potentially involve a wide range of organisations receiving incentives. Assembly members identified a number of pros, cons and conditions about this policy option.  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel by air  149  Pros + It would work – some assembly members felt it “would be enforced as overseen by government. Confident it would happen.” Others suggested there is a “history of financial incentives working” or that there would be “pressure from many directions [so it’s more] more likely to succeed.” + Advantages of working together – some assembly said the “economy as a whole will find ways if [we] work together” or that we “may have [a] better ability to meet the various challenges” if we take this approach. Others felt it would “maximis[e] investment and research into greenhouse gas removal across disciplines and ideologies” and that “encourage[ing] [this] investment could make [the] UK [a] world leader.” + “Shared responsibility amongst all who have an impact e.g. international businesses” + “Cost of greenhouse gas removal shared more widely via general tax” + “Frees up tax payer money for other services”  Cons − Too generous to companies – some assembly members felt there would be “no onus on airline companies” or that it “does not place responsibility on the industry or people that cause remaining emissions.” Others commented that it “seems like the usual big businesses will profit but seen or sold as a ‘green movement’.” In a similar vein, some assembly members suggested that the “companies behind this have already spoken to government and felt it would be better for government to introduce it as it’s a £26 billion industry that will be subsidised??” − Too many cooks – some assembly members worried that it “doesn’t enforce a clear direction i.e. too many cooks” or that “n[o] one organisation has responsibility.” − “No rule/regulations to make change” − “The use of general taxation in respect of air flight emissions is unfair to those who do not fly”  Conditions → “Financial incentives are good for organisations to capture carbon, but only if they are non-profits or class b corporations” → “Incentivised and driven by results e.g. Rolls Royce” → “Each industry and organisation should pay to capture any emissions they produce”  In the voting, this option received significant support from assembly members.  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel by air  150  Vote results Assembly members voted by secret ballot on policy options for ensuring investment in greenhouse gas removals. There were two ballot papers. The first ballot paper asked assembly members how much they agreed or disagreed that each policy option should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. The second ballot paper asked them to rank the options in their order of preference. The votes from this second ballot paper were counted both in terms of first preference votes and via Borda count.  Figure 6: Ensuring investment in greenhouse gas removals  How much do you agree or disagree that each of the following policy options should be part of how the UK gets to net zero? (%) % 100  6% 20% 3%  50  29%  9%  6% 9%  Strongly disagree  26%  17%  Disagree  14%  Don’t mind/unsure  43% 31%  Agree Strongly agree  43% 20%  26%  0 Airline industry invests  Government invests  A wide range of organisations invest  A majority of assembly members ‘agreed’ or ‘strongly agreed’ that all the policy options should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. However some policy options received significantly more support than others. The two most popular options were airline industry investment and investment from a wide range of organisations:   72% of assembly members ‘agreed’ or ‘strongly agreed’ that airline industry investment should be part of how the UK gets to net zero, with 43% ‘strongly agreeing’;    A similar figure of 69% of assembly members ‘agreed’ or ‘strongly agreed’ that investment from a wide range of organisations should be part of how the UK gets to net zero, but significantly fewer (26%) ‘strongly agreed’.  Investment from the airline industry was, however, also more controversial. 26% of assembly members ‘disagreed’ or ‘strongly disagreed’ that it should be part of how the UK gets to net zero, with just 3% saying they were ‘unsure’ or ‘didn’t mind’. The equivalent figures for investment from a wide range of organisations were 15% and 17%.  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel by air  151  Government investment was the least popular of the three options, although a small majority (51%) still supported it. It was also more controversial than the other options with 35% of assembly members ‘disagreeing’ or ‘strongly disagreeing’ that it should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. 14% said they ‘didn’t mind’ or were ‘unsure’. The results of the preference votes shed additional light on assembly members’ views. First preference votes showed a strong lean towards airline industry investment, with government investment coming second and investment from a wide range of organisations third. The Borda count showed a slight lead for airline industry investment with investment from a wide range of organisations coming a very close second, and government investment third.

At the beginning of the weekend, ideas in this area topped assembly members’ list of considerations for government and Parliament to bear in mind (see Section A). ‘Technological change’ was also assembly members’ preferred future (see Section B). Towards the end of the weekend, some assembly members asked if there could be a further vote looking at whether investment in the development and use of new technologies for air travel should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. Assembly members discussed the suggestion at their tables before the vote took place. Assembly members identified a number of pros, cons and conditions about investment in the development and use of new technologies.  Jump to the vote results on page 155  Pros + “Helps with advancing technology” – several assembly members suggested that “investment speeds up its [technology’s] availability”, or that “research always throws out new insights and solutions.” Others felt it would “encourage multinational companies to collaborate” or result in “healthy competition to improve efficient new fuels.” Some said that it would be a “shot in the arm for [the] UK research industry” or that they wanted “Government to ‘sell’ and ‘encourage’ [the] scientific community to get going.” + Business potential – some assembly members said that “technology can be sold to other countries” or that “Britain has strength in this area.” + Do it early – some assembly members said it was “critical” to do it “early”, with some advocating “money and funding and front load it.” Others noted a “need to do [it] soon due to [the] long lead time….” + Impact on emissions – some assembly members felt it “will mean quicker CO2 reduction” and “could make differences to meeting [the] target of net zero.” + Preference for technology as a solution – some assembly members noted that it “could resolve the issue if a solution is found” or that “a solution means no guilt to travel.” Others said technological solutions would involve “least waste”, be “least disruptive” or have “less impact on people’s lives.” Some labelled it the “most progressive” or “most entrepreneurial” way forward. + Support for synthetic fuels – some assembly members noted support specifically for investment in the development and use of technologies relating to synthetic fuels. Comments included: “Carbon capture could be used for fuel rather than buried: as safety issues with burying have not been investigated.”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel by air  153  “Storage is not entirely safe so might as well use it.” “Synthetic fuel could be used for land transport as well.” + “Prefer the developments towards more efficient air travel than methods of removing emissions after (e.g. carbon capture)” + “Aviation seems like one of the most problematic areas for net zero currently” + “If it doesn’t affect your lifestyle maybe you will be inclined to help achieve it”  Cons − Don’t (just) do this – some assembly members said we “shouldn’t rely on it, need to do other things as well e.g. reduce travel.” Others urged “don’t drop everything – i.e. not all eggs in [the] synthetic fuel basket”, or said “not at [the] expense of, or to replace, other options.” Some assembly members expressed stronger views, suggesting that “chasing a magic unicorn is not a solution. We don’t know if it will be possible by 2050.” − Concern about where money comes from – some assembly members asked “where is the funding coming from?” or noted “concern – will cost money to government?” − Not a good use of money – some assembly members said that “synthetic fuels are very expensive – reducing flights is a much cheaper way to reduce emissions.” Others noted that it “could be just extra expense if not successful” or that it “could end up a big waste of time and money.” Some assembly members felt that “public funds must not be used to generate private profits.” − “Limited funding pot and research resources” − “Biofuels put more pressure on land use” − “There may be safety / issues we are not aware of yet”  Conditions → What type of technology is invested in – some assembly members said they would support it “if it is fuel produced” or if “synthetic fuels are considered differently from biofuels – as they take less space.” → Regulation or enforcement – some assembly members said “as long as usage of new fuels / technologies is enforced this must be part of the path to net zero” or said they support “invest[ment] in [the] development and use of technology for air travel – electric, hybrid, biofuels, synthetic fuel. Including regulat[tion of] airlines or producers to incentivise investment.” → “If this involves a significant increase in investment in this area” → “Will it be better to capture carbon and use [it, rather] than store [it] underground?”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel by air  154  Vote results The ballot paper asked assembly members how much they agreed or disagreed that investment in the development and use of new technologies should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. Their results show overwhelming agreement. 87% of assembly members ‘agreed’ or ‘strongly agreed’ with the statement, with a large majority (61%) strongly agreeing.  Figure 9: Investment in the development and use of technologies  How much do you agree or disagree that investment in the development and use of new technologies for air travel should be part of how the UK gets to net zero? (%) % 80  60  61%  40  26%  20  0%  0 Strongly agree  Agree  Don't mind / unsure  6%  6%  Disagree  Strongly disagree  Policy options – conclusions Assembly members were generally supportive of policies to manage the amount we fly, ensure investment in greenhouse gas removals and invest in the development and use of new technologies for air travel. At least 50% of assembly members supported all the policy options. That said, assembly members had strong and clear preferences within the policy options they considered. Overall assembly members preferred managing the amount we fly through ‘taxes that increase as we fly more often and as we fly further’. 80% of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that this should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. Assembly members’ comments suggest that many saw this idea as fairer than the other proposals, which each took into account only one of how often people fly or how far they fly. They also felt it was less problematic in terms of its impact on people with lower incomes. Assembly members consistently highlighted two considerations as particularly important around implementation:  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel by air  155    Some emphasised that exceptions may be needed for people with family abroad or for “essential flyers” like “surgeons.” They also raised questions about if and how the policies would apply to children;    Some noted a wish for any money raised from the policies to be ring-fenced to support new air travel technologies.  In terms of investment in greenhouse gas removals, assembly members tended to favour investment from the airline industry. 75% of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that this should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. There was also significant, albeit slightly lesser, support for the idea of investment from a wide range of organisations. Overall, assembly members were less keen on direct government investment. Assembly members’ comments suggest that behind these preferences lay a feeling that ‘the polluter should pay.’ Some also felt airline industry investment would incentivise quicker process on new technologies. There was however uneasiness amongst some assembly members too, they suggested a need to monitor, scrutinise and perhaps enforce airline industry investment to ensure it actually took place. Assembly members strongly supported investment in the development and use of new technologies for air travel. 87% of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that it should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. Assembly members’ rationale included a wish to see technology develop quickly, and support for a technology-based solution to air travel emissions in general. Some assembly members raised concerns or conditions, including a wish not to rely solely on hopes of technological progress.  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel by air  156  D. Anything else to tell government or Parliament At the end of weekend three, assembly members had the opportunity to add any further thoughts on air travel and the path to net zero. A small number of assembly members chose to add additional points. These centred around eight main areas:   Need for action – some assembly members said we need to “make this a priority … it emits so much carbon!”, “move away from ‘business as usual’” or “think about future generations.” Others suggested that we need to “stop making flying seem like a good thing / so attractive;”    Specific types of flights and air-miles schemes – some assembly members made comments about specific categories of flights, suggesting that we “ban all nonessential air freight”, “ban first class and business class seats” or “limit transit flights [as this] would help get to net zero more quickly.” Some said that we “should get rid of air-miles schemes;”    Alternatives to domestic flights – some assembly members emphasised that alternatives to local and domestic flights, such as rail travel, should be improved;    Carrots and sticks for airlines – some assembly members said that “airlines should be taxed” or noted “airlines are being subsidised to create emissions; it is unfair;”    Freight – some assembly members expressed disappointment that they had not been able to look at freight as well as personal transport use;    International co-operation – some assembly members were keen to stress the international dimension to air travel and the path to net zero, commenting for example that “air travel is so international and global…. There needs to be international collaboration to bring about technological change;”    Questions and concerns around a carbon tax – some assembly members commented: “Are you going to take into account aircraft engines and occupancy in relation to emissions, which will affect the amount of carbon tax for each journey?” “Carbon tax extreme example: You get on a plane, and find that you’re the only passenger!”    Airport expansion – one assembly member said the UK should “stop all airport and runway expansions. We can’t expand while we aim to reduce emissions.”  Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel by air  157  Conclusions Assembly members expressed clear and consistent recommendations about air travel and the path to net zero. There was strong support for steps to ensure that new technologies for air travel progress as quickly as possible. Assembly members chose “speeding up technology” as the top consideration they would like government and Parliament to bear in mind. They also expressed very strong support for investment in the development and use of new technologies for air travel. 87% of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that this should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. A key reason behind this preference is that many assembly members would like to see a solution to air travel emissions that allows people to continue to fly. Their rationale included a wish to protect people’s freedom and happiness, as well as benefits for business and the economy. Their support for continued flying did however have limits. Assembly members resoundingly rejected a future in which air passenger numbers would rise by as much as 65% between 2018 and 2050, labelling it “counterproductive” – only 3% of assembly members chose such as future as their first preference. Instead, assembly members sought to find an acceptable balance between achieving the net zero target, impacts on lifestyles, reliance on new technologies and investment in alternative forms of transport. Taken together, their preferences suggest a future in which:   Air passenger numbers increase by 25–50% between 2018 and 2050, depending on how quickly technology progresses;    30m tonnes of CO2 is still emitted by the aviation sector in 2050 and requires removing from the atmosphere.  Some assembly members noted their support for investment in alternatives to air travel. In terms of how to achieve this future, assembly members’ preferred policy option for managing the amount we fly were taxes that increase as people fly more often and as they fly further. 80% of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that this should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. Assembly members tended see these taxes as fairer than alternatives that only took into account one of how often or how far people fly. They also felt they were less problematic in terms of their impact on people with lower incomes. Some assembly members suggested that exceptions would need to be made for people with family abroad or for “essential flyers.” Others felt that any money raised from such taxes should be ring-fenced to support new air travel technologies.

Climate Assembly UK ― How we travel by air  159  ha pt er  5  In the home C  Summary of recommendations 1 Assembly members emphasised the need for a long-term strategy with a wide range of actors taking steps to move the sector towards net zero. Assembly members strongly supported roles for government investment (80%), local solutions (80%), individual responsibility (80%) and market innovation (80%). 2 A majority of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that 19 policy measures on heat and energy use in the home should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. Policies supported by at least two-thirds of assembly members were:   Support for smaller organisations to offer energy services (94%);    Simpler consumer protection measures (92%);    Changes to product standards to make products more energy efficient and ‘smart’ (91%);    Local plans for zero carbon homes (89%);    A ban on sales of new gas boilers from 2030 or 2035 (86%);    Changes to energy market rules to allow more companies to compete (86%);    Changes to VAT on energy efficiency and zero carbon heating products (83%);    Information and support funded by government (83%), or information and support provided by government (72%);    Government help for everyone (69%) or government help for poorer households (68%);  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home    Enforcing district heating networks (66%).  3 In their discussions, assembly members emphasised their support for tailored solutions for local areas and individual households; increased choice, including through steps to promote competition; and reliable and clear information for the public. They stressed that changes need to work for all income groups and housing types. Some noted concerns about the influence and behaviour of big companies, and around use of personal data. 4 On home retrofits, assembly members emphasised the need to minimise disruption in the home, put in place support around costs, and offer flexibility and choice to homeowners. They showed a slight preference for upgrading each home all in one go (56%), compared to upgrading each home gradually (44%) but attached conditions to the former around how it is financed. Some also stressed that this should be a choice for homeowners. 5 The best technology to use for zero carbon heating is a matter of significant policy debate. However at least 80% of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that each of hydrogen (83%), heat pumps (80%), and heat networks (80%) should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. 94% of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that ‘people in different parts of the country should be offered different solutions to zero carbon heating.’ 6 The 23 considerations for government and Parliament that assembly members identified at the start of their discussions  161  In the home Climate Assembly UK’s ‘in the home’ theme focussed on changes that are needed to the use of heating, hot water and electricity in the home to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions. At the moment, the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the home are:1   Using fossil fuels (gas, oil and coal) for heating, hot water and cooking. Heating needs are greater if homes are not well-insulated. Many homes in the UK are currently poorly insulated;    Using electricity to power lights and electrical appliances (e.g. fridges, freezers, dishwashers, tumble dryers, IT equipment, TVs etc). At the moment, some of this electricity is generated by burning gas and coal.  Around 15% of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions come from the residential sector.2  What did the assembly consider? Thirty-five assembly members considered the topic of heat and energy use in the home. We selected these assembly members from the assembly as a whole using random stratified sampling. This ensured that they remained reflective of the wider UK population in terms of both demographics3 and their level of concern about climate change. These assembly members heard a wide range of views on the future of heat and energy use in UK homes, and how we might move towards that future. They had the opportunity to question each speaker4 in detail. These evidence sessions took place at weekend two of the assembly.  1 2 3 4  https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/ file/862887/2018_Final_greenhouse_gas_emissions_statistical_release.pdf https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/ file/862887/2018_Final_greenhouse_gas_emissions_statistical_release.pdf Age, gender, ethnicity, educational qualification, where in the UK they live and whether they live in an urban or rural area. The assembly heard from ten speakers on ‘in the home’: Jenny Hill, Committee on Climate Change (informant); Professor Nick Eyre, University of Oxford (informant); Richard Lowes, UK Energy Research Centre (advocate); Chris Clarke, Wales and West (advocate); Professor Rebecca Willis, Lancaster University (informant); Polly Billington, UK100 (advocate); Jonathon Atkinson, Carbon Co-op (advocate); Dan Alchin, EnergyUK (advocate); Matthew Lipson, Energy Systems Catapult (advocate); Dhara Vyas, Citizens’ Advice (advocate). All speakers’ presentations are available as slides, videos and transcripts at climateassembly.uk/resources/. An ‘informant’ is a speaker who we asked to cover the range of views and available evidence on a topic. An ‘advocate’ is a speaker who we asked to give their own view, or the view of their organisation. Assembly members knew whether speakers were informants or advocates.  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  162  Assembly members spent weekend three of the assembly discussing the evidence they had heard and their own views in-depth, before reaching conclusions on five separate areas: A.  Considerations: the overarching considerations that government and Parliament should bear in mind when making decisions about heat and energy use in the home;  What should happen: B.  Retrofit: whether upgrades to each home to reduce energy use (for example, to improve insulation) should happen gradually or all in one go;  C.  Zero carbon heating: what technology or combination of technologies should be used to replace gas central heating, and whether or not different parts of the country should be offered different solutions.  How it should happen: D.  Futures: an overarching view of how to make change happen around heat and energy use in UK homes;  E.  Policy options: which specific policies should be used as part of this future.  Assembly members also had the opportunity to discuss and add anything else they wanted to say to government and Parliament about heat and energy use in the home and the path to net zero. Assembly members’ views on the implications of Covid-19 for this topic are touched on in Chapter 10.  Contents of this chapter A. Considerations  page 164  B.

Considerations Assembly members reached their first decisions on ‘in the home’ by discussing their answers to the following question: What considerations should government and Parliament bear in mind when making decisions about heat and energy use in the home and the path to net zero? Assembly members thought about their answers to this question individually. They then discussed their views in small groups at their tables, with each table agreeing their eight top considerations. These top considerations had to, between them, represent the range of views at the table. Facilitators took the top considerations from each table and grouped similar options together to create a list on which assembly members could vote. They checked this list back with assembly members to make sure they had accurately reflected their views. This included making any necessary adjustments. Each assembly member voted for the six options that they felt to be most important. The results were as follows. The wording of the considerations in the table is either word for word what assembly members wrote on their option cards or, where facilitators combined similar options from several tables, how we described the options to assembly members prior to the vote.  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  164  % assembly members who chose it as a priority  Rank  Consideration  1  Strategy needs to be enforceable by government, and binding for future governments. 5 A guaranteed long-term safety guard (including for industry)  60  2  Make this work for everyone. All housing types and geographies (urban and rural)  54  Some assembly members asked to avoid “mak[ing] the poor poorer by loading costs on to them”, with others noting the need to pay attention to “people whose livelihoods will be affected (e.g. heating engineers and farmers).” Some said solutions need to work for both tenants and owners. Other assembly members talked about “infrastructure challenges” including “rural areas …[not having] ready-made pipework in the ground”, disruption caused by “dragging up streets” and the idea that “one size doesn’t fit all.” 3  Education and good communication should build awareness to enable people to make informed decisions  51  Some assembly members suggested this was important to “overcome the challenge of lack of trust in government messages.” Others advised “don’t sell it as ‘dealing with climate change’ but as making a cleaner planet.” Some assembly members suggested that part of the solution could be “more education in schools, colleges.” 4  Have imaginative solutions/incentives to make work financially viable  46  Some assembly members suggested the following: “loans that can be paid off through your bills”, “lower stamp duty for efficient homes”, “connect EPC rating with significant tax subsidy”, “setting up a big charity with big philanthropy money.” Others suggested “using milestones to force change (like TV switchover)” and “making the transition seamless for consumers.” 5  Learn from others and avoid making expensive mistakes  43  Some assembly members talked about a need to “plan things correctly, with everyone’s voices/input to avoid expensive mistakes or revisions and with a phased approach and clear principles.” Others said “government and Parliament need to consider learning from elsewhere to ensure planned, effective changes with clear deadlines (with urgency).” 6  The onus should be on producers/manufacturers, rather than consumers, to:  • • 7  40  “produce products that deliver as intended with guaranteed lifespan”; “ensure access to zero carbon products.”  Solutions should be affordable for all consumers in all circumstances  37  Some assembly members said this should include “helping ‘everyday folk’ (people who would not normally be considered vulnerable).” Others said it “needs to be fair and financially viable for all households.” 8  5  Minimum standard for all homes  31  Some assembly members noted the difficultly in making changes that are binding on future governments, but said they agreed with the sentiment behind the statement. They called for cross-party commitment to changes, in order to create long-term certainty.  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  165  =9  Make best use of the role of local authorities  29  Some assembly members suggested that this included local authorities “using their [area’s] range of natural resources.” Others said to “give local authorities power, but make them more accountable to local people, e.g. via citizens assemblies.” =9  Solutions should be tailored to local and individual needs  29  11  Need to consider impact on jobs, including retraining and retention  23  Some assembly member noted the “impact on jobs, including local jobs,” suggesting a need to “sustain skill-set[s] as technology progresses.” Others said that “industry professionals will require retraining” and that this “should be affordable e.g. [retraining for] boiler/gas technicians on new boilers.” =12  Solutions should focus on reducing energy consumption and improving efficiency  17  =12  Ensure that changes made and any new technology are well-researched and sustainable in the long-term  17  =12  Consider the health benefits of change  17  =15  Cost of manufacturing and disposal (including carbon cost and price)  14  =15  Government and Parliament need to consider legislation that ensures transparency and fairness in lobbying and influencing  14  =17  We need cross-political party solutions  11  =17  Support vulnerable groups with advice and financially  11  =17  Getting the right balance to ensure we build, recycle and upgrade products to deliver the best outcomes  11  Some assembly members asked “can we upgrade/update instead of [going for] full replacement.” =20  Consider adapting Section 106 to include a pot of cash for home insulation  9  =20  Government and Parliament need to consider disincentivising fossil fuels for homes  9  22  Businesses need to be transparent and reinvest profits/not make huge profits  6  =23  Practical, achievable and doable solutions implemented by government  3  =23  Need to consider health and safety of interventions to ensure no negative effects on health e.g. from insulation or technologies  3  Some assembly members suggested “regulation of products and installation to ensure safety and no negative effects on health.”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  166  B. What should happen – Retrofit The first topic assembly members looked at was retrofit. This means making improvements to homes to reduce energy use, such as insulating lofts and walls and reducing drafts from windows. Speakers at weekend two of the assembly told assembly members that significant energy efficiency improvements need to be made to most of our homes over the next few years. Assembly members discussed whether it would work best to:   Upgrade each home all in one go – meaning all improvements to a home (insulation, heating etc) would be done at the same time;    Upgrade each home gradually – meaning improvements to a home would be done gradually over a longer period.  Assembly members discussed these options in small groups, before voting by secret ballot. We start by presenting the rationale for their views, taking each scenario in turn.  Jump to the vote results on page 173  B.1 Upgrading each home all in one go Assembly members felt that this option had both pros and cons, and expressed these in their discussions and on their ballot papers. Some assembly members also suggested ‘conditions’ that should be met if this option went ahead.  Pros + Shorter period of disruption – a significant number of assembly members liked that there would be “shorter disruption”, “less disruption overall”, “less disruption long-term”, or that it would be “out of the way quicker.” Some said there would “only [be] one period of disruption”, that “all the upheaval [would be] in one go”, or that when “it’s done, disruption is finished.” Some said you “don’t have to remove walls/floors multiple times” or “redecorate at every stage.” Others that the “disruption to [the] family lessens”, that it would “reduce [the] duration of family stress and lifestyle disruption” or that it “makes more sense to me to disrupt my family life once.” Some commented that it “wouldn’t be as disruptive if suited to [the] householder’s lifestyle.” + Reduced CO2 – some assembly members suggested it was “the fastest way to drastically reduce CO2 emissions”, that “benefits to carbon [would be] seen quicker”, or that there would be “quicker carbon savings.” Some said or that there “would be more noticeable change to net zero if houses were insulated very quickly”, “immediate benefits in terms of net zero” or that it would be “quicker for households and [the] whole country to move forward in terms of carbon.”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  167  + Cheaper – some assembly members thought this would be “cheaper”, “cheaper overall” or that the “overall price would probably be cheaper.” Some suggested that it “may be cheaper if funded by government/local government – can negotiate a good deal”, or that “if government paid for social housing, [it] would drive energy efficiency and save taxpayer money in [the] short and long run.” + Cost savings – some assembly members felt people would be “saving on energy costs sooner”, that there would be “bigger energy savings straight away” or that people would “save costs with lower bills.” Others suggested that people would “start saving £ quicker and more.” + Improved housing – some assembly members said that “homes [would be] more efficient after [the retro]fit” or that it would result in “more comfortable homes.” + “One central point for coordination, complaints etc” + “Commitment from government – no risk they can go back on it later” + “More jobs (from new home options)” + “Improving house – would all be done e.g. if wanted to sell” + “…at least I know what the total cost is” + “Because of the need to act quickly and for all groups (government, individuals, firms) to be held to account”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  168  Cons − Cost – some assembly members disliked that it would “cost a lot in one go”, that you “have to pay it all at once” or that the “costs will come all at once – people may not be able to afford it.” Some said it’s “expensive”, that it would be “too expensive for some people – would put people off”, or that it’s “better for people with large savings.” Some disliked the “larger financial outlay” or the “cost of installations.” Some assembly members said there would be a “loss of rental income” or asked “where is the money coming from” or “how will the money be found (i.e. expensive tower blocks).” One assembly member commented that “if homeowners are funding it, government can’t mandate they get into debt, spend savings, disrupt their lives etc.” − Disruption – some assembly members felt that this option had “greater implications on lifestyle e.g. moving out”, that it “could increase the need to move a family into temporary accommodation”, or meant a “need for storage for contents.” Others said it “would [be] too disruptive for say, older people and children”, or worried about “disruption for people with children, [the] elderly [and the] vulnerable.” Some disliked that there would be a “disruption to daily life (work, social).” One assembly said “for both landlords and the average home, the amount of disruption caused by such a large renovation project would be damaging.” − Logistics – some assembly members disliked that “more planning and logistics [would be] required to achieve [it] (individual and local government)” or the “logistics of so many tradespeople in concentrations.” − Delays, problems and lower standards – some assembly members said that “projects can take longer than expected” or suggested there would be a “greater likelihood of malfunctions and problems.” Some said they “worry that mass projects may become rushed and not be done to the same standard.” − Lack of skilled workforce – some assembly members said there is a “lack of skilled workers for new tech/methods” or queried “are the workforce ready?” − Unnecessary work and replacements – some assembly members disliked the idea of “replacing [a] working and reasonably new efficient gas boiler before its best before date”, or said they were “concerned that equipment e.g. gas boilers may be discarded early and they’re not cheap.” Others said there would be “possible unnecessary work or [that you would be] shortening the life of existing installations.” − “Scams will increase so will need tight regulation” − “Technology might catch up/be better later” − “People don’t like change” − “What would happen if people don’t agree…to all changes” − “…could distance [the] homeowner from the situation [if they need to temporarily move out] and [they could] feel [a] loss of control of their own home” − “Some kinds of homes [are] more difficult [to retrofit]”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  169  Conditions → Spreading the costs – some assembly members said they “prefer this only if it could be paid for in increments”, or that they supported it “depending on costs and whether it can be spread over time.” Some suggested a need to “spread the initial cost over a number of years”, said that “costs [should be] spread with no interest” or that “payments should … be spread over time for individuals so that there is a low monthly cost (a reasonable amount to add onto monthly bills).” One assembly noted “personally, I would prefer to have it all done in one go. However, because the cost would be higher I think there should be some cost spreading methods / initiatives or incentives in upgrading quickly.” → Bringing down costs / affordability – some assembly members said they would support this option “only if costs are brought down by using official tradesmen [and] multiple buying, also only with subsidies.” Others said they’d prefer it “all done in one go (if affordable).” → Government funding – some assembly members said that “this option …is only preferable if [the] cost can be spread and/or government funding is supplied, full or partial depending on individual circumstances.” Others said that they would support this option “only if costs can be covered using long term funding (and cheap funding) and cover all necessary costs including moving out / storage of furniture and refit and decorating.” Others said they would support this option “if interest free loans from the council [are] available.” → Support for those on lower incomes and fairness – some assembly members said “there would be other factors to consider to achieve this, including government subsidies for low income households/social housing etc.” Others said “there would need to be an element of cost sharing and means testing (those with fewer resources pay less / nothing) and fairness across types of homes/buildings.” → Choice and consent – some assembly members felt that “landlords and homeowners should be given a choice of what would be suitable for them” or that “private homeowners on higher incomes should be given the option to upgrade gradually in addition to all in one go.” Some assembly members said that “different properties may need different solutions – e.g. old versus new houses” or that it “needs to be individualised – solutions need to suit different households.” → Temporary accommodation – some assembly members asked “where do people who have no means to go elsewhere [live]” that it’s “great for people who can afford to live elsewhere”, or that projects “can take longer than expected” meaning you need to “hous[e] people for longer.” → “Incentivise landlords and homeowners” → “Concerned about people who have difficulties learning, [with their] mental [health] etc, how will you help/support this group” → “Need a synchronised supply chain” → “More training [would be] required” → “Easier to coordinate and roll out locally e.g. district heating” → For something like district heating “everyone needs to be on board”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  170  B.2 Upgrading each home gradually Assembly members felt upgrading each home gradually had both pros and cons, and expressed these in their discussions and on their ballot papers. Some assembly members also suggested ‘conditions’ that should be met if this option went ahead.  Pros + Less disruptive – a large number of assembly members felt that this option would entail “less disruption”, “less disruption at any one time”, or that the “disruption period [would be] shorter.” Some said there would be “less disruption dealing with one tradesperson at a time”, that it would be “logistically easier for [a] household as they can live [there] with most [of the] retrofit happening”, or that “work can be done at a steady pace with minimal disruption.” Others suggested that “some jobs might be quick and easy – won’t disrupt as much” or that people would be “more in control of [their] lifestyle (e.g. moving out).” + Flexibility and choice – a significant number of assembly members felt this option “gives individuals more flexibility and choice”, means you “can tailor [it] to your house”, have “work done to suit each house…based on individual cost/need”, or that “it can be tailored to specific individuals’/houses’ needs.” Some liked that it “enables people to prioritise what happens first” or to “cherry pick the most cost-effective options first.” Some said that you “can change [things] as and when the upgrades are needed”, or that you can get the “boiler heating system replaced when [the] old one needs replacing.” Others said you can “tie in [the work] with other upgrades” or that it “can be done alongside other home modifications and upgrades.” Some said it would allow people to “keep an eye on the work” or suggested there could be an “option to opt out…as you go through [the] process.” Others said it “doesn’t prevent people from doing it all in one go.” + Time – some assembly members talked about there being “less new equipment at one time to adjust to/installation glitches”, or it being “easier to adapt to change gradually.” Others said people would be “more willing to change – easier to adapt/can see change” or that it would make it “less scary/easier to process.” Some said there would be “time to fix snags”, or that it would be a “more organic process – time to think about it.” Some said it “allows you to install effective solutions and monitor effective impact.” + Affordability and costs – some assembly members liked that the “cost [is] spread out”, that it would be “easier to spread [the] costs”, “easier to save towards it” or that it “enables people to build up the money to pay for it.” Some suggested it would be “better for people on low incomes”, “more financially viable for lower income individuals”, or “more affordable.” Others said that it “might allow people to wait for [the] price to come down” or that people “may see prices decrease and technology improve over the period of implementation.” Some described it as “cost effective – does not amount [to] large quantities of debt.” + Better solutions and improved technology – some assembly members suggested that people would be “more likely to install [the] most efficient / effective solutions.” Others said that “technology might develop over time”, that it would give “a chance for technology to improve” or that “the time lag may allow for new/upgraded technology to be available rather than an all-in-one approach where the next year much better technology becomes available.”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  171  + Skills and work quality – some assembly members felt it “would be easier to get skilled workers in, as a phased approach”, that the “quality of work could be higher – less rushed” or that the “workmanship [would be of] better standards (learning on the job).” Others said it would “mitigate the risk of poor installation …[and there was] likely to be a better finished product.” + Industry – some assembly members liked that “industry has time to prepare” or the “reduced strain on [the] construction sector and workers.” + “Better for listed homes” + “A home may already be energy efficient so doesn’t need loads of work. When you sell you haven’t done loads of work that you’ve paid for but don’t benefit from” + “The possibility of increasing awareness of the need to change and competitiveness of who has done what”  Cons − Disruption – for some assembly members this option suggested “more long-term disruption”, “longer term disruption”, “continual disruption”, “disruption (e.g. re-decoration) to housing to do it gradually”, or “multiple periods of disruption.” − Takes longer and slower change – some assembly members labelled this option “slow”, said it “takes longer”, is “time-consuming” or that you “don’t get [the] full benefit straight away.” Some suggested that people “won’t get improvements in bills quickly.” Others said it would “take much longer to see the results we need” or that it “may not accelerate our impact on climate change.” − Expense and pay back – some assembly members felt it would be “more expensive” or “may [only] be cost effective in the long run.” Some suggested that the “cost will be much more than if buying all [the] material in bulk…and [you have] to pay for the workers…over a long period.” Some talked about the “challenge of not getting pay back on expensive investments in my home” or suggested you get “potentially less benefit from your investment.” − Difficult to monitor and roll out – some assembly members felt it would be “difficult to monitor if the changes are being made” or that it “might not get done.” Some suggested that it would be “more difficult to roll out [and] coordinate across local areas (e.g. some want gradual, some don’t / availability of workforce).” Others noted that there would be “different companies to monitor (quality of work).” − “People don’t like change” − “People may move or [be] in middle of moving when [it’s] implemented” − “Work for businesses could tail off” − “Less time to pay off debt (i.e. lots of small loans)” − “Might not notice the benefits of making the further improvements”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  172  Conditions → “No one can tell me what to do with my own home – unless government are willing to pay” → “If loans can be offset against the value of the house / is tied to the house” → “Lack of financial incentives as sanction for people not upgrading”  A few assembly members who voted for ‘upgrading each home gradually’ used their ballot papers to expand on some of the points above. Comments included: Everything needs a starting point. I think getting started with basic things i.e. loft, “ insulation, draft proofing, and expand from that.” From an environmental stand-point upgrading all in one go would be great, but I have “ chosen the option to upgrade each home gradually as I see this as being more realistic economically and technologically. Improvements over time may result in cost decreases.” has to be an affordable choice. Consideration must be given to the fact that the “ This average UK resident is in huge debt to begin with so cost is a question. In my case I would not be able to afford to do this at once, so a gradual programme would be satisfactory.”  Vote results Assembly members voted on the two retrofit options by secret ballot, ranking them in order of preference.  Figure 1: Retrofits  Please rank the following policy options in order of preference (% 1st preference votes)  % 60  56% 44%  40  20  0 Upgrading each home all in one go  Upgrading each home gradually  Assembly members showed a slight preference for ‘upgrading each home all in one go’ (56%), over ‘upgrading each home gradually’ (44%). For a number of assembly members, their backing for all-in-one retrofits was however conditional on what financial support and arrangements  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  173  would be available. Conversely, only one assembly member said their support for ‘upgrading each home gradually’ was conditional on a particular measure. Some assembly members emphasised on their ballot paper that both options should be available or that each is good for different purposes: a homeowner, I would need to do things gradually, due to cost, so that would be my “ Aspreference. If the government or housing association were responsible I would go for option 1 as they have the ability to do several houses at once.” [for a] homeowner (cost and inconvenience, normal on-going renovations). “ Gradually All in one [for]…social housing should be the best approach.” I do think though that it shouldn’t be a ‘one size fits all’ situation and both methods “ should be considered.” “[I support Option 2 because] it would not prevent households upgrading in one go whereas ‘all in one go’ prevents [people upgrading] gradually.” I do not believe we should force people into a decision one way or the other. Different “ people have different circumstances. What is better for one is not better for the other.” The assembly member who made the last comment above abstained from the vote.  Retrofit – conclusions Taken together, assembly members’ votes and comments paint a nuanced picture of their views on retrofits. They suggest that assembly members saw three areas as particularly important:   Disruption – many assembly members were keen to minimise disruption in people’s homes. They had different views on whether it would be better to have less disruption more often, or one much more major disruption. However it was clear that anything that could be done to minimise disruption and stress for people during retrofits would be welcome;    Cost, who’s paying and how – assembly members talked about costs in relation to both ‘upgrading homes all in one go’ and ‘upgrading homes gradually’, but felt they were particularly important in relation to the all-in-one retrofits. Assembly members had a range of suggestions for steps that might help, including spreading out payments, ways of bringing down the initial cost, and government funding. Some assembly members noted concerns around how to make retrofits affordable for all income groups and housing types;    Flexibility and choice – the idea that householders should be able to choose the solutions best suited to them featured prominently in assembly members’ discussions and comments, although slightly less so than the two areas mentioned above.  Assembly members also raised points around impacts on CO2 emissions, work quality, and the availability of improved technology, among other issues.  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  174  When it came to the vote, assembly members had mixed views about whether gradual or all-inone retrofits would be best. In pure percentage terms, their votes showed a slight preference for ‘upgrading each home all in one go’ (56%), over ‘upgrading each home gradually’ (44%). However, some assembly members attached conditions to their backing for the all-in-one-go option around what financial support and arrangements would be available. Others were clear that they felt both gradual and all-in-one retrofits should be possible: for some this was about the ability of households to choose what is right for them; for others, the best option depended on the type of housing in question.  C. What should happen – Zero carbon heating Assembly members discussed two different areas in relation to zero carbon heating:   Different technologies that could be used to replace gas central heating (heat pumps, hydrogen and heat networks);    Whether or not different parts of the country should be offered different solutions.  At present most homes in the UK are heated with natural gas, which is a fossil fuel. This section takes each of the above areas in turn, firstly presenting assembly members’ rationale and then the results of the relevant votes.  Jump to the vote results on technologies on page 181  Jump to the vote results on variation by area on page 185  C.1 Heat pumps Assembly members discussed electric heat pumps in small groups. They identified the following pros and cons.  Pros + Use renewable energy and create no emissions – some assembly members liked that they “would be run on renewable energy”, “can be powered with cleaner energy”, or that you “can power [them] with solar panels.” Others liked that they produce “no carbon emissions – can be run on solar for each individual property”, that there are “zero emissions at point of use”, or that it “doesn’t rely on carbon capture.” One assembly member suggested that “heat pumps could be provided with solar panels and a wind turbine to provide free energy so people could rent the equipment for a similar price to current heating bills, or better still cheaper.”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  175  + Works everywhere, anytime – some assembly members said that they are “available everywhere” or “can be used everywhere [and are] …easy to implement everywhere.” Some commented that they “can be used all year round.” + Ready to go – some assembly members noted that we “already have the technology – ready to go?”, that they are “proven to work”, are “available now” or “are in use now.” Others said they are a “short-term technology” or “can be done sooner and everywhere.” + Efficient – some assembly members suggested they are “really efficient” or “more efficient than other options.” + Rural areas – some assembly member felt they are “better for rural areas” or the “only option in rural areas – no pipework for h[ydrogen].” + Individual – some assembly members said a heat pump has the “same cost and doesn’t require being part of network” or that they “can be one to a house.” + “Less financial investment required” + “2 different options – air and ground” + “Safe – no flammable gas – no hydrogen – no hot surfaces indoors” + “It’s really cosy, comfortable and good for the environment” + “Once installed the heat pump will not be emitting any CO2 gas and will encourage and hopefully ensure good/efficient insulation so no heat will be wasted”  Cons − Disruption – some assembly members felt heat pumps would need “disruptive installation work”, or be “more disruptive to install.” Some suggested that they “could possibly require full refurbs of properties”, that “all houses need new internal pipework (disruption)”, or that you “might need to update pipes/plumbing.” Others noted that heat pumps “requir[e] large changes to houses (could also be a pro).” − Need for insulation – some assembly members disliked that the “house needs to be properly insulated beforehand”, or that “homes need to be well-insulated.” Others suggested that “old houses…[would be a] challenge to bring up to [a] good insulation standard.” − Initially expensive to install – some assembly said that heat pumps “can be very expensive”, are “expensive to install”, or are “more expensive to fit initially”. Others echoed that the “initial outlay [is] expensive” or said they disliked the “installation and product costs.” − Noise and look – some assembly members talked about an “ugly box in your garden”, said they are “unattractive to look at” or that they create “noise pollution.” Some felt that the “air con unit in [your] garden [would have a] visual and possible noise impact.” − Space needed for pump – some assembly members disliked the “space [needed] for installation”, the “space required outside”, or that it “needs outside space.” − Not as hot – some assembly members said that the “hot water temperature is lower than current levels”, or that there “can be a slow heating process.”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  176  − “Manufacturing is ‘dirty’” − “Can’t store excess energy” − “Susceptible to power cuts” − “Concept hard to understand” − “Air source [is] not effective at really low temps”  Some assembly members suggested conditions they would want to be in place for heat pumps to be used. Some said that “solar panels need to be part of the mix and windmills at home.” Others talked about the “role of surveyors – need to be proactive.” Assembly members’ votes showed considerable support for heat pumps. Please see below for the vote results.  C.2 Hydrogen The second technology that assembly members discussed was hydrogen. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons.  Pros + Works with current infrastructure – a significant number of assembly members commented that hydrogen “fits with current pipework in the house and nationwide.” Some said it “doesn’t require home upgrade first”, that it “can more easily be used in natural gas central heated houses,” or that it’s “easy to retrofit and boilers [are] not too much more expensive.” Others said it ”can be piped in like natural gas with no extra visible infrastructure”, that it “fits with current infrastructure”, that “it uses the existing heat network – less disruption”, or that the “delivery infrastructure for homes is there.” + Easy to transition – some assembly members suggested that it would be an “easier transition”, “easy for gas companies to transition”, that it “will seem familiar in how it works” or that there are “no big lifestyle changes required.” + Cost – some assembly members suggested that “widespread use could drive cost down” or that it would “driv[e] competition in the market to get [the] price down.” + Emissions reductions – some assembly members said that it would result in a “really dramatic reduction in CO2” or that it is “zero carbon when it’s burnt.” + “If it is like natural gas it will be good at keeping your house warm” + “More innovation friendly” + “Could be self-sufficient”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  177  + “Could combine with natural gas – if supply problem” + “I have gas already and I know it works. Green hydrogen would be the ideal solution in an ideal world”  Cons − Technology not ready, including for scale – some assembly members suggested the “technology is still nowhere near”, the “technology is not made yet” or the “technology [has] not yet been used on a large scale.” Others said “hydrogen is not available yet / not proven”, that “it can’t be done now”, or it “is not currently available – there’s no easy or clean way of producing it.” Some said “implementation is difficult – wouldn’t be able to be done at scale until [the] 2030s”, “we don’t have it” or that it “requires more investment into production.” − Expensive – some assembly members said it is an “expensive process”, “too expensive”, “very expensive to produce”, “expensive if it works”, or “will always be expensive….” Others were more optimistic saying “the big concern is the cost of hydrogen production, but that may come down.” − Green vs blue hydrogen – some assembly members highlighted that “hydrogen needs to be produced which has its own problems”, that there is a “risk that fossil fuels are still used to power them” or a “worry that hydrogen still uses (or could use) fossil fuels.” Some assembly members disliked the fact blue hydrogen “relies on carbon capture”, with some concerned specifically about the “risk of carbon leaks from underground storage.” Others suggested that “hydrogen can only be considered from ‘green sources’”, that it “needs lots of electricity to produce – only green hydrogen [should be used]”, or that “carbon capture is not a long-term solution.” − Safety risk – some assembly members disliked the “safety” implications, or suggested there is a “safety risk – explosive.” − Not available to all – some assembly members said that it’s “not available in all areas” or that “not all homes [are] connected to [the] gas grid.” − “Does not work with existing boilers” − “Requires hot water cylinder” − “Gas network needs [to be] maintained” − “Hydrogen is not as energy intensive as natural gas. The process of obtaining hydrogen from natural gas seems to be counterintuitive since natural gas is already a clean, energy dense fuel source, and it will require a lot more hydrogen to achieve the same energy output. In addition it will require a lot of energy to extract the hydrogen and further energy and resources to deal with the CO2 (blue hydrogen)”  Some assembly members suggested conditions they would want to be in place for hydrogen to be used. Some wondered whether “smaller networks [could] be created to make it more available.” Others suggested that it “might be viable in [the] long term [only] – due to [the] costs of electrolysis.”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  178  Assembly members’ votes showed considerable support for hydrogen, although this support was slightly less strong than for heat pumps and heat networks. Please see below for the vote results.  C.3 Heat networks Assembly members discussed heat networks in small groups. They identified the following pros and cons.  Pros + Cheap and income generating – some assembly members suggested that heat networks are “cheaper”, “cheaper for households”, the “cheapest of all options” or “cheap to run once set up.” Others suggested that they “could generate income for families” or that they would make it “easier to help those in need – lower cost.” + Efficient and effective – some assembly members described heat networks as “efficient”, “extremely efficient”, “efficient for urban areas or “most effective for cities.” + Mass change – some assembly members talked about the potential for “mass change at once – quicker solution and easy to implement for lots of houses.” Some suggested it was “easy to roll out locally and convert large areas.” + Good for some areas and owners – some assembly members suggested it is “good for towns / built up areas”, “great for cities and some smaller towns”, or “good for large scale house owners e.g. housing associations.” Some suggested it “can be used for streets i.e. mews, homes close together.” Some assembly members sounded a slightly more cautious note saying it is “great for the areas affected – but limited to some areas.”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  179  + Waste heat used – some assembly members liked that it “uses existing waste heat”, “can soak up extra heat”, or “can use existing heat which would otherwise be wasted.” + Sense of community – some assembly members felt it “encourages co-operation in communities” or “creates a spirit of community.” + Boiler / maintenance not in the home – some assembly members liked the idea that “maintenance [is] done centrally – not in your house” or that the “boiler etc [is] not in your home or garden.” + “Technology already exists and [is] already in use” + “Can be mixed with other solutions” + “Easy for new builds” + “Can use different sources based on areas e.g. geo[thermal]”  Cons − Not suitable everywhere – a large number of assembly members suggested that it “needs [a] certain density of buildings”, is “only for cities”, “only good in urban areas / geographically restricted”, or is “only really effective in cities / towns.” Some said it is “good for large housing infrastructure”, is “only suitable for certain areas – a small percentage of homes” or “would not be available for all.” Others noted that it is “not as good for rural areas” or “not available in low intensity housing.” Some said “a lot of places [are] not set up for it – a lot of work.” − Disruption – some assembly members said there would be “disruption for installation”, “disruption when fitting pipes etc initially” or “disruptions in refitting network.” Some suggested it “may be cheaper in flats – high-rise / tower – but in individual houses [it] would be disruptive.” − Difficult to retrofit – some assembly members felt it would be “hard to retrofit” or “more difficult for existing buildings.” − Loss of individual control – some assembly members expressed “concern about individual control”, or noted that “everybody in their network has to be in it (no choice)” or “everyone has to be on board.” − Bigger problems if breakdown – some assembly members suggested it was “not fault tolerant”, or that “if it breaks down [it] would affect more people.” − “Need a separate immersion heater” − “Sophisticated engineering at individual level required” − “Expensive to implement” − “Requires forward planning”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  180  Vote results Assembly members voted on heat pumps, hydrogen and heat networks by secret ballot.  Figure 2: Zero carbon heating  How much do you agree or disagree that each of the following options should be part of how the UK gets to net zero? (%) % 100  3% 9% 6%  11% 9%  6% 14%  Strongly disagree Disagree  46%  63%  50  49%  Don’t mind/unsure Agree Strongly agree  34%  20%  31%  0 Heat pumps  Hydrogen  Heat networks  At least 80% of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that each technology should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. Variations between the results for the different technologies were minimal: slightly more assembly members supported the use of hydrogen (83%, compared to 80% for the two other technologies), but fewer ‘strongly agreed’ with its use (20%, as opposed to 31% and 34%).  C.4 Different solutions for different local areas After considering the three types of technology, assembly members moved on to look at whether people in different parts of the country should be offered different solutions to zero carbon heating. They identified the following pros and cons.  Pros + Areas are different, so solutions should be different too – a large number of assembly members said that it would result in a “suitable solution for [the] area you’re living in”, or that “each area may need choices that are more suitable [to it].” Others noted that “different parts of the country have different resources and restrictions”, that “rural and urban areas will have different requirements” or that “every area is geographically different and what will work well in one area will not work in others.” Others agreed, saying that “one heating  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  181  solution does not cater to each location, financial or maximum efficiency consideration we have discussed”, that “[viable] options depend on location, infrastructure on [the] ground, cost per unit of home”, or that “different kinds of heating will work in different areas depending on the area (rural/urban) and the kind of housing (rented / homeowners).” Some assembly members said specifically that “local energy resources should be allowed to be used if more efficient – e.g. hydro, wind, tidal, solar, industrial waste heat”, or that we need “’local solutions to national problems’ – local government is better suited to finding efficient energy generation based on [their area’s] natural resources and infrastructure.” Others said that “heat networks are not suitable for rural areas”, that “some people aren’t on [the] gas network so can’t just switch to hydrogen”, that “rural communities [are] not on the gas network [so] are only left with heat pumps”, or that “air source [based methods are] inefficient in colder weather and areas.” + Choice – some assembly members liked that “people have a choice.” Others said that “people should always be allowed to choose what is better for their individual circumstances” that “giving people a choice is always important when trying to get them to buy-in to change” or that “if [the] technology is available, why restrict freedom of choice?” One said: “I like all of these options. If you can afford heat pumps etc it should be the homeowner’s or housing association’s choice, with [the] agreement of tenants.” + Democracy – some assembly members commented that “more choice = more democracy” or that “everyone should have a say in the changes required.” + Competition and cost – some assembly members suggested it would be “more competitive”, that it “encourages competition with lower prices for people” or that “multiple providers / options should hopefully lead to competitive pricing.” Some said competition would provide an “opportunity for technical improvements.” Others said that “some solutions might be cheaper in different areas.” + Economy, jobs, industry – some assembly members felt that “being able to sell [a] diversity of tech …[is] better for [the] economy.” Others said it would create “more job opportunities” or that you “could have specialists in that local area to do the maintenance.” Some suggested there would be “less strain on individual industries due to diversity” or “less demand / strain on each type.” + All three technologies are needed – some assembly members said that “we need as many options as possible” or that “the best solution could involve using a mix of these [three] options in different areas.” One assembly member said that “to achieve net zero emissions I believe a hybrid solution of the 3 proposals – heat pumps, hydrogen and heat networks is required.” + “More power to local government for decision-making” + “Individual solutions can be rolled out quicker” + “Less infrastructure” + “House prices might dramatically rise in areas with strong heat networks, creating more rural-urban migration”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  182  Cons − Regional inequality – some assembly members disliked the idea of “regional inequality”, saying that “success in certain places” could result in a “change in house prices” or, more broadly, that “different rates of progress could disadvantage some people / areas.” Some assembly members also noted that “costs might vary from area to area – needs to be done fairly so that people don’t pay more – consider subsidies.” − Efficiency and maintenance – some assembly suggested it might be “slow to roll out as not centrally planned”, or that there would be “multiple networks needing maintenance.” Some suggested that “too many options may lead to less efficient combinations being used so it may be appropriate not to offer a choice.” − Risk of no choice and lack of support – some assembly members felt there is a “risk of being dictated to e.g. in cities have to be in a heat network”, while others noted that “people may not get onboard.” − “Worry that hydrogen still uses (or could use) fossil fuels” − “People should have the right to choose but [no choice] is understandable if there’s no other option e.g. rural areas” − “I think we need more expert advice and a structure. … each case is different depending on the type of property and individual household, also it’s important to learn more about all the risks before committing and spending money on a boiler that will not be effective in the long term” − “Limits the economy of mass production”  Some assembly members suggested measures they would want to see in place if different areas are offered different solutions: I believe that central government funding to local authorities should be based on the “ options they have at their disposal to avoid any unfair disadvantages to areas that are not rich in natural resources, so [that] each LHA [can] have a consistent fair approach and all energy consumers pay the same price.”  “ Needs good joined up / partnership working” should be used to explain why different options are available to “ Transparency different people.” Assembly members voted overwhelmingly in favour of offering people in different parts of the country different solutions.

A large majority (68%) ‘strongly agreed’.  Zero carbon heating – conclusions The best technology to use for zero carbon heating is a matter of significant policy debate. However assembly members were clear that, in general, they would be comfortable for any of the technologies to be used. At least 80% of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that each technology of heat pumps, hydrogen and heat networks should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. Assembly members also had clear views about whether people in different parts of the country should be offered different solutions to zero carbon heating. 94% of assembly members ‘agreed’ or ‘strongly agreed’ with this statement, with 68% strongly agreeing. For many assembly members, local areas have different geographies, resources, infrastructures, restrictions and costs; they felt that areas should be able to choose the technologies best suited to their needs.  D. Futures Having considered what the future should look like in terms of home retrofits and zero carbon heating, assembly members moved on to look at how change should happen. To aid them in this process, the Expert Leads presented assembly members with four scenarios: 1.  Individuals take responsibility;  2.  Market innovation;  3.  Government investment;  4.  Local solutions.  Together the scenarios cover a broad range of views about how change might work. They were not mutually exclusive.  Jump to the vote results on page 198  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  185  D.1 Individuals take responsibility In this possible future, individual householders or landlords would have responsibility to upgrade their properties. This would include installing energy efficiency measures and zero carbon heating. It would involve:   The government setting minimum standards for carbon emissions from heating and powering homes;    Householders / landlords arranging for energy companies, and installers of heating and insulation, to make changes in the home;    Existing energy companies, like British Gas, possibly having a significant role;    A need for special arrangements for people who cannot afford to contribute.  Assembly members discussed this possible future at their tables. They identified the following pros and cons.  Pros + Choice, freedom, and tailored solutions – a large number of assembly members commented that “people [would] have the freedom to choose what they want, when they want and who they want” or that “people need to have the freedom to chose what is best for them.” Others commented that “individuals know their own circumstances and needs.” + Promotes interest and support – some assembly members suggested that “empowering individuals to make their own choices will promote support for the scheme” or that it “promotes individuals’ interest in seeking alternative solutions (gets the ball rolling).” Others suggested that “choice of individuals can be incentivised.” One assembly member felt it would create a virtuous circle: “individuals make choice to go ‘green’ – market reacts offering more options and better products, and government acts on people’s opinion to win votes [and] set policies to help houses go ‘green’ and this influences local government.” + Control and responsibility – some assembly members said that it’s “good to have control over who work[s] in your own home i.e. recommendations, tradespeople known to you” or suggested that “if individuals take responsibility they are safe in the knowledge that any improvement[s] made are safeguarded – no scams from unregulated firms.” Others said that they liked the idea of “individuals taking ownership of the solution and acting on it”, that “individuals have their own choice to choose therefore [it’s] giving them responsibility”, or that “the more responsible the house owner the better their benefit.” + Competition and prices – some assembly members felt it “drives competition”, that “competition amongst firms ‘may’ keep costs lower”, or that the “creation of new companies should regulate prices with the bigger suppliers.” + Government set standards – some assembly members said there are “advantages [to]... government standards”, or that they liked that “government sets standards – for landlords / private sector” or that the “government sets minimum standards for carbon emissions and powering homes.”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  186  + Sharing solutions and results – some assembly members suggested that “actions completed can help inform and influenc[e] others by sharing results” or that “recommendations of work people can be shared.” + “Set price to be introduced” + “Takes the pressure off government to front cost” + “Familiar with making choices about energy supply”  Cons − Cost – some assembly members disliked the “financial costs on the individual”, or that “regulations may impose large costs on home owner[s].” Others worried that “individuals may not have the funds”, or commented that it’s “expensive – low income families, people living in insufficient homes won’t take responsibility due to costs.” Some suggested it “may be more expensive without bulk buying or savings from doing a whole area at the same time.” − Barriers to change and not forcing people – some assembly members suggested that “some people won’t do anything / will object” or that you “can’t ‘force’ people to do things.” Others said it would be “difficult to convince people to spend money”, that “financial consideration[s] might outweigh decisions”, or that “individuals may not have the resources to take responsibility.” Some felt that “it won’t result in enough/fast enough change because individuals won’t take responsib[ilty] or have enough money” or that “the choice may cause individuals to delay decisions.” − Lack of knowledge, scams and poor quality work – some assembly members suggested that “individuals don’t know the right tradespeople to call – lack of technical knowledge” or that “you may not get the skilled person to do the right job.” Others felt that “companies could take advantage of lack of knowledge”, or that “vulnerable people could be ‘ripped off’ by rogue traders.” Some noted the need to “really trust the supplier!”, or said that they “don’t want to have to rely on energy companies as they have a poor track record.”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  187  − Need for information – some assembly members said this “needs a lot of information which is honest, unbiased” or that “some individuals may not know how/what to do (outside help needed).” Some suggested that “lack of information = bad decisions” or that this future “punishes those with less time to do adequate research (those with kids or demanding jobs)….” − Issues with landlords – some assembly members suggested that “private landlords would meet minimum standards only (if that!)” or that “landlords may not act and skip corners as [the changes] will not increase [their] income”. Some suggested that “landlords [would] nee[d] incentives i.e. rogue landlords.” − Cutting corners and the wrong solution – some assembly members felt that “people might go with a cheaper solution that may not be ideal if they are not going to live in the house for long” or that “individual[s] may cut corners to save on cost/time.” − Lack of government funding – some assembly members disliked the fact it was “self-financed” or that there was “no government funding.” − Doesn’t work with district heating – some assembly members said that you “can’t co-ordinate individual solutions to work with wider local initiatives e.g. district heating” or there’s a “lack of coordination with choices so [it] would work against district heating.” − “The best technology may not be available” − “Not great/takes choice away from tenants”  Some assembly members made additional points about this future. They suggested that consideration should be given to:   Insurance – “an insurance for company failures”;    Ease and affordability – some suggested “government subsidies for the individuals concerned” or said it “works if made easy and affordable”;    Reliable and clear information – some felt that “information provided to individuals should be recommended by a regulatory body e.g. Checkatrade” or noted a need for “Plain English! Clear”;    Rented properties – some asked “what about rented properties – can tenants choose which system since they are paying [the] bills”;    Enforcement – some queried “who will regulate and check these ‘minimum standards’?”  Assembly members showed considerable support for this future in their votes, although slightly less than for some of the other futures. Please below for the vote results.  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  188  D.2 Market innovation In this possible future, it would be easier for any company, not just energy companies, to sell ‘energy services’ (like ‘heat as a service’)6. It would involve:   The government setting minimum standards for carbon emissions from heating and powering homes;    Companies being allowed to sell ‘energy services’ – packages including insulation, energy efficiency, zero carbon heating, renewable electricity (e.g. solar panels) and storage (e.g. batteries);    A need for special arrangements for people who can’t afford to contribute.  Assembly members discussed this possible future at their tables. They identified the following pros and cons.  Pros + Competition, prices and quality – some assembly members suggested that a “competitive market will drive down prices and drive up quality/choice”, that there would be “more ideas about making services better and cheaper” or that “companies competing should result in lower prices and better products.” Others agreed saying that a “wider range of choice [is] likely to drive down prices”, that “more competition … may bring prices down“, that “innovation drives revolution – market competition drives lower prices” or that “companies can offer more competitive choices.” Some suggested that “co-ops/non-profits may keep costs lower for consumers.” Others said that it would be “good for competitive services – Ofcom and trust pilot involvement.” + More options and choice – some assembly members welcomed the idea that “more or different options will be available e.g. heat as a service”, that there would be “lots of options from companies”, or that “you can choose where you go for your services / individual needs.” Others liked that it is “open to wide range of companies, including co-ops, non-profits, smaller local tradespeople.” + Tailored solutions for households – some assembly members suggested that “households will be offered a solution that is tailored to them – less stress, best decision made” or that “consumers may benefit as it can be tailored to their needs e.g. buying heat per hour.” Others said they liked “tailored solutions” or “tailored solutions for homes.” + Company skills – some assembly members commented that “companies can provide information that individuals don’t already have” or that “companies have the resources / skills to find solutions and implement.”  6  This is where you pay a company to manage your home heating – for example, by hour and by room – and provide you with heat when you need it, rather than just paying a gas bill.  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  189  + Less responsibility, easier to understand (heat as a service) – some assembly members liked that it’s “less responsibility for individuals to learn / make decisions”, that there’s “less responsibility on the home-owners to know what needs doing and how much it will cost” or that there’s “less worry [because]…everything is included.” Others said that “some people prefer decisions solved for them – given full product” or that it’s “easier to understand – don’t need to decide which is right for you.” Some liked that “everyone knows their target and [the] improvement required.” + One-stop-shop – some assembly members highlighted the “possibility of one bill pays all” or suggested there “could be a one stop shop (finance loan).” + Less reliance on government – some assembly members suggested it was “likely to be longer lasting due to not having a direct dependency on government” or that it “eases the financial responsibility on the government.” + Economy – some assembly members said it would lead to the “creation of new jobs as companies innovate in new areas” or that “there’s great potential here for a new industrial revolution.” + “Recommended by government – minimum standards must be met. Possible subsidies for these types of companies” + “De-risks a technology mistake – someone else takes this hit”  Cons − Concerns about companies – a large number of assembly members expressed concerns about companies: − They suggested that “companies may not have your best interest as a priority (profits first)” or that they could “potentially offer more profitable choices, instead of lower carbon choices.” Some assembly members felt that “companies may implement options which they can get away with but [which] are not the best for consumers.” Others envisaged a situation where the “technology is available but companies will go for [the] cheaper option” or said that the “best options can be held back e.g. iPhones.” − Some assembly members worried that companies may “cherry pick houses and areas that are more profitable”, with some suggesting “houses [would be] refused services due to income.” Some asked, “if companies can deny services to a property – what will they do?” Others worried that “companies [would be] unable to deliver produce in some local areas” or that the “market/companies may not cater to certain areas – regions.” − Some assembly members felt that “companies may allow price fixing to occur.” − Some assembly members worried about the “standard of goods being sold (under par).” Some felt it “could lead to companies making less longer lasting products / not reparable to keep profit margins high” or companies “rush[ing] products to market which aren’t suitable and do not meet standards i.e. VW diesel.”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  190  − Some assembly members worried about the potential to “mislead customers” or said that “vulnerable people could get sold expensive solutions.” Other assembly members expressed concern about ”cowboys.” − Some assembly members commented that there are “lots of negatives – possibility of low standards, poor information, mis-selling – needs [to be] handled right as there’s lots of risks.” − Hard to understand – some assembly members worried that it would be “hard to communicate different services/products – complicated!” Others said it “might be confusing and difficult to understand deals”, that “too many options offered by companies can cause confusion” or that “individuals will have too many choices – get confused [about] what is best for them.” Some said it is an “unfamiliar way of getting our energy.” − Affordability and expense – some assembly members suggested it “might be difficult for poorer households, local areas and jobs contracts etc” or that “if government doesn’t provide incentives / subsidies for these innovations, it won’t be feasible for poorer households.” Some disliked the potential for “expensive products.” − Lack of strategy and co-ordination – some assemblies members disliked that it is “not a nationwide strategy”, while others suggested that it would be “more difficult to co-ordinate solutions across a local area because individuals can choose what they want.” − “Job security for smaller companies – higher risk of companies folding” − “May become ‘one size fits all’ for many and rest unsuitable” − “No incentives for individuals to implement change” − “‘Minimum standards’ again – landlords difficult to enforce”  Some assembly members made additional points about this future. They suggested that consideration should be given to:   Regulation – some assembly members talked about the need for a “regulator to ensure prices and work [quality]” or said it “needs proper regulation.” Others said “company standards [would need to be] regulated and reviewed regularly (penalties)”, that there would need to be “regulations to prevent …mis-selling” or that it “needs regulation – no dodgy tradespeople.” Some felt that there would need to be “protection for individuals less able to understand” or that it “should be regulated so [that it] can’t be driven by profit. No dodgy tradesmen or upselling”;    Clear offers and information – some said it needs “clear understandable offers” or information that is in “plain English – clear and concise”;    Moving house – some said “consideration [should be given to]… what happens with [a] package system if [you] move house?”  Assembly members showed considerable support for this future in their votes, although less than for some of the other futures. Please below for the vote results.  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  191  D.3 Government investment In this possible future, central government would invest public money in a nationwide retrofit scheme. It would involve:   Each home owner being offered help to get their home up to high standards, including replacing gas boilers;    Government making a national plan for different technologies in different areas;    Private companies still having a role in providing energy services (primarily selling electricity).  Assembly members discussed this possible future at their tables. They identified the following pros and cons.  Pros + Co-ordination and planning – some assembly members liked the idea of “government plans for each area”, suggested that the “government could have a co-ordinated policy and be responsible” or welcomed the “large-scale” nature of a “strategic national plan.” Others said it could “fund the provision of [a] knowledge and expertise base for steering the way forward.”7 Some suggested that “government needs to invest and work with local authorities. LAs need to advise on local issues, housing.” + Quicker and more effective change – some assembly members felt that it would be “quicker and more effective” or “would lead to greater reduction in CO2 in shorter time.” Others commented that “government investment [would] motivat[e] decisive action to stop loss”, that “it will happen if government organise it” or that “rules and regulations will force the change to happen.” + Standards and government control – some assembly members felt that “all changes [would be] made to the same standard” or that the “standardised nature of services [would be] more efficient and cheaper in [the] long-run.” Others suggested that “as [it’s] associated with government [it’s] more likely to set a minimum quality standard” or for “good standards of work to be set.” Some said that “government control [would] … ensure higher standards.” Others liked the idea of “government control over the technology.” + Costs and financial help – some assembly members liked that it would be “government funded”, that there would be a “financial incentive for homeowners”, that government would “offe[r] financial help to homeowners” or that “homeowners will be offered help to achieve green homes.” Some said it “takes pressure off [the] individual – financial and logistical” or would result in “less cost to [the] individual.” Others suggested that “government could keep the costs down by preventing it being profit led.”  7  One comment on a ballot paper expanded on this point. It said a “government fund is needed to establish a body of expertise to give professional guidance and advice to individuals and local government to help / ensure only viable solutions are attempted whilst allowing as much freedom of choice as possible.”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  192  + Less responsibility for individuals – some assembly welcomed that this “takes away ‘our’ responsibilities”, or meant “less pressure for individual[s] to make a decision.” Some noted that “if it fails it is ‘their fault!’. + Efficient use of existing resources – some assembly members felt that this future would “make use of [the] best local resources – efficiency, creates less waste”, while others welcomed “using existing resources to make the changes.” + “Individuals could extend the changes if government produces a minimum level of adaptations” + “Contributes to national economy / independently run (not reliant on foreign firms i.e. google)” + “Elect[ed] people choose policies”  Cons − Lack of individual / homeowner choice – some assembly members disliked “taking choice away from home-owners”, that “householders [have] no choice”, or “removing choice from individuals.” Some labelled it “dictatorial homeowners don’t want to be told what to do.” Others said it “creates a ‘nanny state’.” − Lack of flexibility – some assembly members suggested that there would be a “lack of flexibility because of [the] ‘one size fits all’ approach” or noted a need to “identify the technologies for the areas as certain environments may prove impossible.” Some felt it would be “harder to cater to individual properties”, or disliked that it “look[s] for a one size fits all solution to keep costs down.” − Bureaucracy and red tape – some assembly members disliked a “reliance on government red tape” or the “possibility of bureaucracy and inter-department disagreement.” Some suggested that it would take a “long time to implement – red tape!” Some said “Government bureaucracy £££.” − Cost, overspend and inaccuracy – some assembly members felt that the “tax payer could be ripped off”, that there would be “overspending”, or that government “cannot be trusted to use [the] most economical business.” Others suggested that the “tender for projects [would] not [be] accurate just like HS2.” − Not enough investment – some assembly members suggested that “government may be less inclined to invest as much money as needed” or that “government may not fund as much as initially promised.” Some felt there was a “risk of low-quality upgrades due to cost restrictions” or worried about whether the “help offered will…be enough… changing tech, new ideas, and new tech.”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  193  − Restricting innovation – some assembly members said that “blinkered government could restrict new innovations”, that there “may be less scope for innovation as government led” or that “new technology can be slow to get government support / bureaucratic process can be slow so we may end up being behind technologically.” Others suggested government is “unwilling to invest in long-term solutions.” − Risk of change in political party in power – some assembly members noted that “if political parties in government change this may affect / cause uncertainty to any national plan”, or that it “could be subject to political changes (who is in power) legislation reversal?” Some suggested that it “could be hard to separate [from] politics.” Others felt it “needs to remain across party governments.” − Lobbying – some assembly members expressed concerns about the “risk of large companies being able to lobby central government to change policy (large energy firms)” or suggested that “government could be sway[ed] by large companies…policy-makers then benefit them.” Others wondered if it was “open to lobbying, possible corruption?” or felt there would be “less of a role for smaller companies or co-operatives and community groups in decisionmaking and implementation.” − Private companies might unfairly profiteer – some assembly members worried about “private companies making prices, extortionate” or suggested that it “needs strict monitoring of incompetent or greedy private companies.” − “If it fails it is government fault – and then no progress made” − “Problems with service delivery” − “Who decides who gets help – who pays for those who are exempt”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  194  Some assembly members made additional points about this future. They suggested that:   “Costing has to be reported and broken down”;    There should be “regulations only for all landlords but not individual owners”;    “You will need higher taxes or charges”;    “Government should provide fairly priced solutions but not strict enforcement.”  Assembly members showed considerable support for this future in their votes. Please see below for the vote results.  D.4 Local solutions In this possible future, local government (e.g. a city or a county) would have overall responsibility for getting homes to zero carbon. It would involve:   Local government co-ordinating a local plan for getting homes to zero carbon;    Local government working with private companies and community groups to offer energy efficiency improvements, zero carbon heating and other services to householders;    Central Government backing up this work with resources;    A need for special arrangements for people who can’t afford to contribute.  Assembly members discussed this possible future at their tables. They identified the following pros and cons.  Pros + Tailor to local areas – some assembly members felt that this future would result in the “best solution for local areas as [it would involve a] better understanding of localised needs.” Some talked about solutions “localised and personalised to [the] local area”, “tailored solutions based on geographical and local resources” or “localised tailor made solutions.” Others liked that “everyone can enjoy a solution that suits their locality”, that solutions will “suit [the] local area better – targeted” or suggested that “different strategies in different areas could be positive.” + Knowledge and interests of local government and local organisations – relatedly, some assembly members said that “local government / organisations have better knowledge of [the] local area”, that “local government will have best knowledge of local resources”, that “local government should have a better idea of local needs” or that “local government will ensure that what works best for their area will be chosen for them.” Some said that “local councils should benefit rural communities more than central government.” Others talked about “pride in local government.”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  195  + Local economy, trades and companies – some assembly members suggested this future would result in “bringing jobs into [the] local area, boosting [the] economy and local trusted firms.” Some felt there was a “higher chance of supporting local trades/businesses”, or an opportunity to “focus on and encourage local business development appropriately” or “grow local industries.” Some suggested that “it may keep work local to do installations etc”, would be “good for local businesses” or would mean “more work for local companies.” Others said that the “use of local companies / contractors for each local area will bring economic benefit to the area instead of using larger companies!” + Engaging local community – some assembly members said it would be “easier to work with different groups in [the] community (e.g. local firms) compared to [a] centralised system” or that the “local community would be more involved/interested.” Others noted an opportunity to “involve [the] community with decision-making”, or suggested that it would be “more democratic and may challenge and improve recommendations.” + Accountable – some assembly members suggested that it would be “easier to identify accountable officers”, that “local government [can be] held to account” or that it would be “accountable to local residents, more local and votes.” + Cost-effective – some assembly members felt it would be a “cost-effective option for areas done all at once”, or “most cost-effective to work locally.” + Central government involvement and funding – some assembly members liked that this option “still has central government involvement” or that the “funding [is] backed by central government.” + “MORE FUNDING to carry out projects.” + “Easier to manage/implement” + “Local people with less funds may be considered more if part of local community” + “All solutions are available – whether district heating or private (heat pumps)” + “Council advocates for or encourages legitimate / reliable products and services so more likely to install better quality products”  Cons − Lack of local government money and resources – some assembly members said that “local government is always short of money”, “may not be able to allocate adequate funding”, or “may not have the budget.” Others said that there is “insufficient funding – local governments have all had [their] funding cut”, that “local government does not have [the] existing infrastructure/resources to do this” or that “local government needs extra support and money – agree funding on a range of matters – resources, equipment, services etc.” Some said it “may be too slow £££ – not enough money and might cost more.” − Less choice for the individual – some assembly members said there would be “less choice for private owners”, “less choice for individuals” or that “residents and homeowners don’t have as much choice.” Others suggested that the “local solutions offered may not suit everyone” or asked “will they listen to what people want.”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  196  − No strategic or central approach – some assembly members said this was “not a strategic approach and [involves] missing out on lost savings and not doing [what’s] best.” Others disliked that there was “no central co-ordination” or worried that “different strategies in different areas may lead to regional inequalities” or “uneven costs”. Some said that those responsible would be “unwilling to invest in long-term solutions.” − Tax increases – some assembly members felt there would be an “increase [in] local taxes to pay”, that “council tax will just increase to cover costs” or that an “increased cost [to] local government = increase for taxpayers.” − Quality of implementation and solutions – some assembly members worried that “local lack of expertise could be a problem for implementation”, or that there was a “risk of poor choice of contractors”, “cowboys” or “choos[ing] [the] cheapest solutions, not the best.” − Politics and vested interests – some assembly members suggested there could be “possible party political bias”, that it “could be too political” or that there was a risk of “conflict of vested interest by councillors.” Some said that local councils “may disagree with [the] main government then fail.” − “Low income families may still not be able to contribute/benefit” − “Red tape” − “May not use government funding in total”  Some assembly members made additional points about this future:  “ Need for informal forward looking, efficient, innovative local councils” “ How would local authorities prioritise where gets changes first?” “ Local citizen assemblies deciding which tech is best for local environment” “ Must be options for choice [for] individuals” “ Central government will need to work with local authorities to meet local needs” Individuals should be trusted to chose what is best for them but they should be “ supported by government” Assembly members showed considerable support for this future in their votes.

The first ballot paper asked assembly members how much they agreed or disagreed that each future should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. The second ballot paper asked them to rank the futures in their order of preference. The votes from this second ballot paper were counted in two ways:   Counting assembly members’ first preference votes only. This tells us what assembly members would and wouldn’t choose if they could have their most preferred future.    Using Borda count. This involves allocating points for preferences – a first preference vote scored three points, a second preference vote two points and a third preference one points, and a fourth preference no points. Counting the votes like this tells us which futures are most acceptable to the greatest number of assembly members.

There were slightly higher levels of strong support (“strongly agree”) for ‘local solutions’ and ‘government investment’, with ‘market innovation’ receiving the lowest levels of strong support.

Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  199  One assembly member commented: I think that the best solution is actually a combination of them all. We need government “ investment and regulations to force the change and make it available. The solutions need to be considered on a local level to incorporate the different needs/resources there. Then the individual can make a decision on what is available to them. Market innovation alongside this could allow for a wider range of options and collaboration.”  Futures – conclusions Assembly members backed a combination of ways to create change in heat and energy use in the home. 80% of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that each of individual responsibility, market innovation, government investment and local solutions should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. Assembly members were particularly positive about ‘government investment’ and ‘local solutions’. They suggested that government investment would mean a co-ordinated plan, with quicker change and clear standards, among other benefits. They felt that local solutions would result in plans tailored to local needs, and that they would benefit the local economy and facilitate better engagement with local communities. ‘Market innovation’ tended to receive slightly less support across the votes, with assembly members expressing concerns about potential company behaviour.  E. Policy options After considering how to make change happen in general terms, assembly members moved on to consider what specific policies that might involve. They looked at policy options in five areas:   Information;    Fairness and consumer protection;    Standard setting;    Incentives;    Roles and powers.  For each of these areas, the Expert Leads recapped and explained potential policy ideas. Assembly members discussed these options in their groups before voting by secret ballot. They were also able to note suggestions for additional measures. We start by presenting the rationale for their views, taking each policy option in turn.  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  200  E.1 Information Assembly members looked at four options around information:   Carbon MOTs for houses;    Information and support provided by government;    Information and support funded by government;    Information and support funded by private companies.  Jump to the vote results on page 207  Carbon MOTs for houses This would involve each home having a test every few years to see what improvements could be made to reduce its energy use (e.g. draught proofing, better insulation, heating upgrade). It would be carried out by independent assessors. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about carbon MOTs for houses.  Pros + Useful for selling/renting property – some assembly members suggested Carbon MOTs could be “useful if selling [a] house” or “useful for prospective tenants and rental property.” Others noted that they “could be adapted as a scale to add value to [a] home in selling.” + Awareness of issues and improvements – some assembly members said it “can make people aware [of] defects / improvements” or that a “compulsory MOT will help identify [the] minimum improvements required to achieve net zero.” + Tailored advice – some assembly members felt it “could provide more specific / tailored solutions and pricing”, a “specific, personalised assessment and advice for [your] home”, or “personal advice suitable to your house rather than general [information] that you have to relate to your situation.” Some suggested it “provides a clear cost estimate … helping homeowners budget accordingly (advisory).” + Helps with funding – some assembly members said it “simplifies [the] process of applying for funding” or “acts as an evidence base for financial support.” + Quick to implement – some assembly members suggested that it “could be implemented straight away” or that we “already have trained energy assessors to take up the role.” + Jobs – some assembly members felt it would “provide jobs!” or be an “opportunity for jobs.” + “Landlords will face more pressure to ensure properly-insulated homes” + “Identify trends/patterns in existing houses to be rectified” + “Would be good to get independent advice (voluntarily)”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  201  Cons − Ineffective and stressful – some assembly members questioned “would ‘failing’ the MOT mean you must fix it or [is it] advisory? If …[it’s only advisory], what’s the point?” Others asked “what happens if you fail?” or ”will there be follow up checks – will there be consequences if work not done / haven’t met standards?” Some said it “could cause stress knowing that your house is not suitable.” Others asked “would it affect [people’s] ability to sell [their] house?” − Compulsory and punitive – some assembly disliked that it was “compulsory not voluntary” or said it amounted to “big brother government interference.” Others described it as “punitive – could result in more regulations, costs and fines”, or said “MOT is the wrong word to use – conjures up ‘regulation’ not advice.” Some said it “could end up penalising homeowners… need to focus on using incentives (carrot not stick) such as lower council tax.” − Difficult to enforce and implement – some assembly members said it would be “difficult to police and enforce”, or “difficult to implement.” Others asked “what happens if homeowners refuse to have [the] MOT done?” − Invasion of privacy – some suggested it was an “invasion of privacy” or that “some people may find it invasive?” Others said there could be “resistance to strangers entering homes, especially [from the] elderly.” − Potential costs to individuals and households – some assembly members worried about the “cost of MOTs.” Others said “some people will face huge costs – not everyone can afford it” or queried “who pays – low income families cannot afford.” Some people said that “people may not be happy to pay.” − “Waste of money” − “If funded through taxation not everyone would contribute” − “Resistance to a new scheme people do not know about” − “Very labour-intensive (28 million homes to inspect!)” − “A house is not a car” − “Cat flaps, pets?”  Some assembly members said they would only support this policy if it was a “single MOT once [and] only advisory!” Others said it would need to “tailor results to personal situations. Not everyone should be forced to take the fastest option to reach net zero.” Similarly others said there would need to be an “allowance for special situations” or queried “are required improvements compulsory, especially in rented accommodation.” Some assembly members said it would need to combined with “government funding.” Others said work would need to go into ensuring that MOT assessments are “genuine and honest.”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  202  Information and support provided by government This would involve the government running an information campaign to tell householders and landlords how they could make their homes zero-carbon and who can help them. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about this policy option.  Pros + Trustworthy – some assembly members suggested government is “unbiased as they are not making profits from the solutions” or that “information from government shouldn’t be profit led.” Others felt it would be a “trusted source of information – i.e. [it would] direct [you] to reputable sites and companies.” Some noted that “Government has access to advice.” + Carries more weight – some assembly members said that “people [are] likely to take note of information given by the government” or that it “carries more weight.” + Cheap and no direct costs to consumers – some assembly members felt it would be “cheap” or “relatively cheap to run.” Some noted it would be “paid for out of [the] public purse – no direct cost to consumers.”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  203  + Clear, uniform and accountable – some assembly members liked the idea of a “uniform message for country.” Some said it would be “clearer from government” or that “if [it] comes from government, it comes from one voice (accountability).” + Access to information – some assembly members said there would be a “constant reminder”, “more varied information” or that information would be “easily available.” + Effective and fair – some assembly members said it “could be extremely effective if it’s a good campaign (multiple services)” or that “if controlled by government they can provide subsidies and best solutions” and they “can’t go bankrupt like private companies.” Some said “government can offer fair incentives to all.”  Cons − Information is too general – some assembly members disliked that the “information given is more general and less specific for individual homes” or worried that the ”information provided could be too generalised.” Some suggested that the “government could provide [a] one-solution-fits-all approach which doesn’t meet the needs of everyone” or that people “might not be able to relate [the information] to [their] actual personal situation.” − Lack of trust in information – some assembly members suggested that government “can be accused of scaremongering”, that there is a “lack of trust in government” or a “fear of misleading information.” Others said it could feel like “‘Big brother’ i.e. public perception of being told what to do.” − Ineffective – some assembly members said that “people will not listen to advice”, “a lot of people just wouldn’t listen or care” or that there is “no incentive for people.” Some said it would be “ineffective if it’s a bad campaign” or “might not reach everyone.” − Vested or party interests – some assembly members worried about “party influence on [the] information provided” or the “possibility of information being influenced by vested interests.” − “Paid for by taxes”  Some assembly members said that they would want to see a “consistent campaign” or that they would want the information provided to include details of agencies that could provide advice on the work to be done.  Information and support funded by government This would involve information and support funded by government, but run by an independent organisation such as Citizens’ Advice. The government would pay this organisation to run an information campaign that tells householders and landlords how they could make their homes zero carbon and who can help them. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about information and support funded by government.  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  204  Pros + Independent advice – some assembly members felt that “people might listen to an independent organisation more”, or liked that it would be “independent advice” or “independent info – should be able to trust impartiality.” Others suggested it would be “clear of party politics” or “unbiased because not working for the profits.” Some said that “people trust C.A.B. [Citizens’ Advice Bureau] + charity organisations” or trust “C.A.B. and energy saving trust [because they have] no vested interest.” + Access to up-to-date and constant information for everyone – some assembly members liked that you “can be made aware of incentives and offers/options” or that it would be a “constant presence (across governments etc).” Others said it would be “good for everyone to have access to information.” + Effective – some assembly members felt it “could be effective if people use it and they’re encouraged to seek the help” or “could be very effective if it’s a good campaign.” + Locally provided – some assembly members suggested it “can be provided locally” or could be “widespread…in local areas.” + “Still individual choice” + “Place to complain about issues and get information – give consumers a voice”  Cons − Funding – some assembly members worried that it “may have insufficient funding” or that “funding by government may be cut (not consistent across governments).” Some said that “priorities must change over time – due to cuts.” − Costs more – some assembly members suggested it would be “more expensive / ineffective to outsource [the] campaign rather than [run it] through government” or that it would “cost slightly more.” − Lack of trust if not coming from government – some assembly members felt it “would be difficult to get a trustworthy organisation” or said “some may feel they can trust the government more than a company.” Others worried about “lobbying to get [the] contract”, or that the organisation running the campaign “might fund research which is biased or ideological” or “may provide selective information not all (unless asked directly).” − Individuals may ignore it or not be aware – some assembly members said that “people might not be inclined to listen and take action” or that “as not from the government, people may ignore the information.” Some said that “people may be unaware of [the] organisation”, that there’s a “lack of awareness of this type of organisation” or that it’s “hard to encourage people to seek the advice – especially if it’s [the organisation or campaign] unknown.” − “Could be overburdened with information”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  205  Some assembly members said they would want it to be an “equal service for everyone”, with “information provided regularly.” Some said that “all information needs to direct to support – funds / loans may not be clear.” Others said their support was conditional on “funding [for] Citizens’ Advice”, or a “mix of funding (companies and government).” Some commented that “legislation for private housing is generally efficient….”  Information and support funded by private companies This would involve information and support funded by private companies through energy bills and run by an independent organisation such as Citizens’ Advice. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about this policy option.  Pros + Independent, non-profit, credible and knowledgeable – some assembly members suggested that it “may provide [an] opportunity for independent personal advice.” Others said they liked the “independence of [the] organisation [doing] delivery” or that these “organisations are non-profit – no incentive to do anything else / rip consumers off.” Some felt there would be “confidence from [the] public in credible sources providing data” or that “they have knowledge and expertise to offer this service.” Others said “it is essential that any information and advice given by any organisation is independent and free and correct.” + Saving money – some assembly members suggested that people “could save money – good advice” or that there would be “more incentives and offers.” + Scale (constant and widespread) – some assembly members felt there would be a “constant presence (across different governments etc)” or that it could be “widespread in local areas.” + Funding – some assembly members liked that “everyone contributes to the funding of it” or said that “they [private companies] have the funding to run the initiative.” + “Place to complain about issues and get info – gives consumers a voice”  Cons − Potential bias – some assembly members said there is a “chance private companies could influence the organisation”, that “private company vested interest [is a] concern” or that “the private companies are run for profit and won’t have the best interest of their consumers at heart.” Some said that “private companies develop their own technology, rather than a fair view of other options”, that they are “biased towards their own services” or that there would be “bias towards commercial interests / products.” Similarly others said that they “may be biased recommendations favouring certain products, ways and companies”, that they would be “perceived to be biased” or that they would use “their expertise to present the info in a way that will encourage you to spend money unnecessarily.”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  206  − Poor delivery and lack of resources – some assembly members suggested that “methods of delivery might not be good” or that there might be a “lack of expertise to provide subject matter information.” Others worried there would “not [be] enough advisors to cover demand” or that “accessibility and organisation may be impaired due to lack of funding.” − Increase in energy bills – some assembly members disliked the “increase in energy bills” or said that it’s “not good for energy bills to go up before anything is done – bills are already too expensive.” Some said “if run by private companies – could potentially lead to price fixes and higher bills.” − Ineffective – some assembly members said it’s “hard to encourage people to seek advice”, that there is a “lack of awareness of this type of organisation” and that this policy involved ”no compulsion.”  Some assembly members asked “can the higher energy bills be paid for by companies (profits) rather than the consumer.”  Vote results Assembly members voted by secret ballot on policy options around information. There were two ballot papers. The first ballot paper asked assembly members how much they agreed or disagreed that each policy option should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. The second ballot paper asked them to rank the options in their order of preference. The votes from this second ballot paper were counted both in terms of first preference votes and via Borda count. A clear majority of assembly of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that three of the policies should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. In order of overall levels of agreement, these were:   Information and support funded by government (83%);    Information and support provided by government (72%);    Carbon MOTs for houses (63%).  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  207  More assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ with carbon MOTs for houses (37%) than with the other two options they viewed favourably (29% and 23% respectively). Only 37% of assembly members supported the idea of ‘information and support funded by private companies.’ A greater percentage (40%) ‘strongly disagreed’ or ‘disagreed’ that it should be introduced.  Figure 7: Information  How much do you agree or disagree that each of the following policy options should be part of how the UK gets to net zero? (%) % 100  9%  9%  20%  14%  6% 11%  9% 31%  9% 60%  49%  26%  50  26%  37%  29%  23%  Information and support provided by government  Information and support funded by government  0 Carbon MOTs for houses  Strongly disagree  Disagree  23%  Don’t mind/unsure  Agree  11% Information and support funded by private companies  Strongly agree  The ranking votes largely reinforced the results of the first vote. Carbon MOTs for houses was the most popular policy in terms of first preference votes, possibly reflecting the higher levels of ‘strong support’ for it in vote one. In the Borda count all three options supported by a majority of assembly members in the first vote scored well. ‘Information and support funded by private companies’ remained the least popular option by some distance.

Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about this policy option.  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  210  Pros + Everyone pays – some assembly members liked that “everyone pays” or “every household pays.” + Fair – some assembly members felt it is “fairer because everybody pays for the energy that they use” or “fair because it is like paying for improvements.” + Money can be ring-fenced – some assembly members liked that the “funds are more specific”, that you “can raise funds specifically targeted at [the] project” or that it “keeps the money in a separate pot – ring-fenced.” + “Will drive efficiency as you’re paying for your energy” + “Easier to monitor (tax evasion) can’t falsify energy bills” + “Some willingness to pay” + “Simple way of raising money for improvements” + “Save money when using less energy in summer months”  Cons − Impact on certain groups, including those with low incomes – some assembly members disliked that there would be a “larger impact on poorer people” or that “people on low incomes will pay more” compared to other options. Others said it “could be unfair towards those of lower income” or that “low income families cannot afford any increases.” Some suggested that “people who need most heating (e.g. the vulnerable) will pay the most”, or that the “wealthiest / those with multiple homes who holiday frequently may end up paying less.” − Tenants paying for improvements to landlords’ properties – some assembly members suggested this policy would mean “tenants paying energy bills to add efficiency improvements to landlords’ homes” or that “renters pay extra but landlords may get [the] benefits if [the] house qualifies for support.” − Penalising certain homeowners – some assembly members said “people with energy efficient homes will pay … no benefit to them” or that “people with fully electric homes will be penalised.” − Money goes through energy companies – some assembly members queried “how [to] guarantee money goes towards improvement funding and not profits for energy companies”, said there would be “no transparency on where money is spent” or that there “would need [to be] clear criteria for how the money is used.” Others disliked that the “money goes directly to energy suppliers, not the government” or commented that “energy companies already have too much money and they should be reinvesting profits instead of consumers paying increased bills.” − Cost – some assembly members said that “bills are high enough already”, that it “may be too expensive” or that “it’s like another tax.” − “A lot of people would find it hard to understand how higher energy bill = more effective”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  211  Raise money through taxation and government borrowing This would involve the government using public money, raised through taxation, to fund some energy efficiency improvements. The government could also borrow money. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about this policy option.  Pros + More proportional – some assembly members said “it’s more proportional to income so fairer”, that “proportional pay[ing] will help lower earners” or that people with “bigger houses using more energy are often more affluent and [would] pay more tax to fund the energy efficiency.” Some said “there is an underlying principle of fairness in that employed people must pay for those that won’t want to pay.” + “Everyone pays in” + “People who don’t pay tax still get the same benefit as others” + “Will help landlords and tenants” + “Already know how to collect tax (who to increase)” + “Tax [is a] good method to raise the money [and a] good use of the government” + “Paid for over a long time” + “Easier for government to disguise as increase in tax”  Cons − Doubts over how money is spent – some assembly members said there is “no guarantee [that the] money raised will be used for [this] specific purpose” or that “no government taxes are ringfenced.” Others queried “will all funds be used for cutting carbon or used on other projects”, “will taxes raised directly fund the solutions” or “who decides how the money is distributed.” − Unfair – some assembly suggested it was “unfair because tax is avoided by higher earners! (employ accountants!)” or noted that “not all earners pay – tax avoidance loopholes used.” Others felt it is “unfair for people who work to have to subsidise those who do not.” Some said “high earners with energy efficient homes lose out as they pay more and get nothing back” or that there would be “no benefit, but extra cost for households that have already decarbonised privately so they are paying twice.” − Tax is unpopular – some assembly members disliked that it’s an “increase in tax.” Others felt it would be an “unpopular method”, that “any tax increase is unpopular – and a ‘vote loser’” or that “some people won’t be happy.” − Cost – some assembly members said “it’s going to be a massive amount of money” or that it “may be costly for both public and government.” − “More bureaucracy” − “Each house could receive only a small amount, too little to carry out any work”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  212  Some assembly members noted ‘conditions’ that they would want to see in place for this policy to be implemented:   Everyone benefits – some said we “wouldn’t mind paying more taxes if we’re all getting the free improvements or the same percentage”;    Tax loopholes closed – some asked for “work to close all tax loopholes (business and individuals)”;    Ring-fence the money – some said “we would want the money to be ring fenced” or that the money should go into a “pot…[with] clear criteria for use”;    Time-limited – some asked for “a time limit on the taxation – till the problem gets solved”;    Use money saved by EU exit – some assembly members said the government should use the “money saving from [the UK’s] European Union exit” instead.  Government help for everyone This would mean that everyone could get help to fund improvements to their home, regardless of income. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about this policy option.  Pros + Simple and quick – some assembly members suggested it is “simple and easy to allocate”, “would be much simpler [as] no means testing” or that it “might speed up the process because the government can just get it done.” + Universal help – some assembly members liked that it is “universal”, or that “ALL who need will be helped.” Others noted more specifically that it “doesn’t discriminate against location / inherited homes” or that the “the middle classes would benefit – they wouldn’t miss out.” + People more likely to make the changes needed – some assembly members felt people would be “more willing to make change because it’s offered by government”, that it “will ensure changes are done – people need encouragement not based on income/finances” or that “people have a huge incentive to make the changes.” Others said “this prevents folk from opting out – they wouldn’t want to opt out – 100% compliance.” + “Could work well with other reforms”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  213  Cons − Everyone gets the same even if they don’t need it – some assembly members disliked that it’s “not means-tested so individuals who can afford to do repairs still claim funding”, or that it’s “subsidising house owners that can afford the changes.” Others said that “some people can afford to do the work themselves”, or that “people feel higher earners can pay [their] own way – may seem unfair.” Some labelled it “regressive (could help rich people more)” or commented that “money [is already] wasted on free bus travel and fuel payments to people who don’t need it.” − Borrowing is a bad idea – some assembly members said that “borrowing ties up government funds” or that “borrowing to finance changes is high risk and bad for [the] economy.” Others suggested there are issues around “intergenerational fairness – government borrowing paid off by future generations.” − Costs and their implications – some assembly members said it would involve “high costs” or that it is “costly to provide services to everyone.” Some commented that it’s a “huge cost to cover everyone so [would need] more taxes to fund [it].” Some suggested that “funding may be cut in other areas to allow the outlay….” − Unfair on those who have already made the changes without help – some assembly members felt it would be “unfair to those who have already made home improvements.” Others noted that “some people may have done [the] work needed and end up losing out” or that there is “no benefit to those who have already decarbonised, but [they will] still [be] expected to fund others’ decarbonisation.” − Not all houses are the same – some assembly members commented that “not everyone’s houses are the same size” or that “not everyone’s house needs [the] same level of work.” Some felt this option would be “taking away personal preferences – not all homes are the same.” − “Might overwhelm providers of services/upgrades”  Some assembly members noted ‘conditions’ that they would want to see in place for this policy to be implemented:   Funding cap – some assembly members suggested that we “cap the amount of help so that it costs less for government” or that it “could have a ceiling cap – to minimise the burden on government money”;    Vary the help – some assembly member suggested that “some people could get more help than others if it is determined by income” or that we need to “set standards/ guidelines [that] can be applied to ensure equity in [the] help provided.”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  214  Government help for poorer households This would mean households on a lower income and/or who have high energy costs (‘fuel poor’) getting help to fund improvements to their home. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about this policy option.  Pros + Targeted help for the most vulnerable – some assembly members liked that it would “help the vulnerable”, is “helping the most vulnerable” or is “targeted assistance for poorer households.” Others approved of the “focus on supporting low income households” or on “providing a better service for 1 group of people (poorest).” Some said it would “hel[p] health and those who couldn’t otherwise do it” or conversely that “households that can definitely afford [to do it] don’t get government money.” + Less cost to government – some assembly members liked that there is “less cost to government overall” or “less cost to government as helping less households.” + Lower costs to individuals/households – some assembly members said it would mean “less tax” or “will decrease bills.” + “Create jobs in low income areas” + “Could work well with other reforms” + “Right way to do things”  Cons − Misses people who need help – some assembly members asked “what about the middle income (class) earners who currently struggle to pay bills” or said “middle folk – mid income folk will miss out.” Others said it’s “not taking into account other factors e.g. disability could disadvantage some” or “people with the lowest income may not be the neediest.” − Public feeling – some assembly members suggested that the “public may feel it’s not fair” or that it “could cause resentment in people who can’t afford to make similar improvements.” − Limits change – some assembly members wondered if people would be “discouraged to move forward if they cannot get assistance?” or said there would be “no incentive for people who don’t receive funding to make improvements.” Some commented “this is a national priority so why restrict the support.” − Issues around landlords/tenants – some assembly members suggested that “landlords may not spend the money fairly” or that it “could allow landlords to get support if their tenant is poor.” − Stigmatising for the poorest – some assembly members worried that it “could stigmatise” or that it would “stigmatise poorer homes.”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  215  − “Not realistic” − “Funding could be via taxation again high earners/ tax payers lose more”  Some assembly members noted ‘conditions’ that they would want to see in place for this policy to be implemented:   Think through implications for landlords and tenants – some assembly members said we “need to figure out who pays if [it’s a] landlord/renter situation, and [the] impact of this.” Others said it “should be for house owners not households – rented should be via [the] landlord as [it’s about the] owners’ not renters’ income.” Some felt that “with new rules and legislation putting the onus on landlords it may increase rents.”    Criteria – some assembly members talked about the need to define clear criteria for support or made suggestions for what these should look like:  “ How is ‘poor’ defined? Is there a means test? How to regulate this?” “ Who sets the criteria for assistance” “ Scales of help so that people with middle income can be included too but less” Simpler consumer protection measures This would involve the government reviewing current rules on consumer protection to make them simpler and more effective. There are currently lots of separate sets of rules, covering different aspects of energy (such as supplying gas and electricity, or fitting boilers), as well as products and services linked to energy (like building regulations). This can make it difficult for people to know who to turn to if something goes wrong. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about simpler consumer protection measures.  Pros + Makes things easier – some assembly members suggested simplification would make the rules “easier to understand and apply”, would “reduc[e] confusion re: rules / standards” or would “mak[e] life easier.” + Proactive problem-solving – some assembly members suggested that “more understanding leads to proactive action” or that it “would enable problems to be fixed quickly.” + Consumer protection – some assembly members felt it would ensure “those in vulnerable positions are protected” or boost “consumer confidence and protection.” + Centralised responsibility – some assembly members suggested it “gives government responsibility”, that it “would be good to have centralised protections for consumers” or that there would be “less onus on consumers to take action.”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  216  + “Could work well with other reforms” + “Can develop as things change to improve rules” + “Imperative, as this is a national priority”  Cons − Less effective – some assembly members suggested that “making measures simpler could make them less effective” or that we “don’t want to oversimplify (regulations are often necessary).” Others felt there would be “more opportunity for abuse” or that “loopholes could be exploited due to oversimplification.” Some highlighted a “need to maintain protection against digital companies misusing consumer information.” − Impractical – some assembly members said it would be “difficult to set-up”, “could be difficult to set up?” or “might take time to implement.” Others asked “who enforces [the] new rules?” − Would people use it? – some assembly members queried “are consumers aware of the recourse they have to support if things go wrong.” Others said it would mean “more changes to learn about” or that it “may not seem necessary enough to act [in a] timely [way].”  Some assembly members suggested that consumer protection measures “nee[d] clarification rather than simplification for consumers.” Others noted a need to think about any “funding implication.”  Vote results Assembly members voted by secret ballot on policy options around fairness and consumer protection. There were two ballot papers. The first ballot paper asked assembly members how much they agreed or disagreed that each policy option should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. The second ballot paper asked them to rank two pairs of options:   ‘Raise money through adding to all householders’ energy bills’ versus ‘raise money through taxation and government borrowing’;    ‘Government help for everyone’ versus ‘government help for poorer households.’  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  217  Figure 10: Fairness and consumer protection  How much do you agree or disagree that each of the following policy options should be part of how the UK gets to net zero?

However the extent of their support varied:   92% of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that ‘simpler consumer protection measures’ should be part of how the UK gets to net zero, with nearly half (46%) strongly agreeing;    Very similar numbers of assembly members supported ‘government help for everyone’ (69%) and ‘government help for poorer households’ (68%). However of the two, more strongly supported ‘government help for everyone’ (43% compared to 34%);    Overall more assembly members supported ‘raising money through taxation and government borrowing’ (65%) than ‘raising money through adding to all householders’ energy bills’ (54%). However ‘adding to all householders’ energy bills’ received more strong support (23% compared to 14%). It was also more controversial: 34% of assembly member ‘disagreed’ or ‘strongly disagreed’ that it should be part of how the UK gets to net zero, compared to 18% for ‘raising money through taxation and government borrowing’.  The preference voting shed additional light on assembly members’ views:   It reinforced assembly members’ slight preference for ‘government help for everyone’ over ‘government help for poorer households’;  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  218    It suggested that when faced with a straight choice between the two, slightly more assembly members preferred ‘raising money through adding to all householders’ energy bills’ than ‘raising money through taxation and government borrowing.’  Figure 11: Fairness and consumer protection  Please rank the following policy options in order of preference (% 1st preference votes)  % 60  53% 47%  40  20  0 Raise money through adding to all householders’ energy bills  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  Raise money through taxation and government borrowing  219  Figure 12: Fairness and consumer protection  Please rank the following policy options in order of preference (% 1st preference votes)  % 60  53% 47%  40  20  0 Government help for everyone  Government help for poorer households  E.3 Standard setting Assembly members looked at three options around standard setting:   Ban sales of new gas boilers;    Changes to product standards;    Requirements for selling and renting.  We start by presenting the rationale for their views, taking each policy option in turn.  Jump to the vote results on page 227  Ban sales of new gas boilers This would involve the government announcing a ban on the sale of new fossil fuel gas boilers. The ban would come into effect in 10 or 15 years time (2030 or 2035). Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about this policy option.  Pros + Encourages innovation and better technology – some assembly members said it “influences industry to innovate”, that it will “encourage [the] market to develop and research new products” or that “it is a deadline that is going to speed [up] innovation.” Others said it “will encourage innovation as companies know demand will go up” or that “the more time will produce better technology.”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  220  + Time to plan – some assembly members liked that it “allow[s] for a transition period”, or that “long timescale policies [give] time to plan.” Others said that “time ahead to plan timings sounds practical” or that “boilers will need replacing anyway so they can slowly switch over.” + Better for consumers – some assembly members felt it would “increase awareness with consumers” or create “less responsibility for consumers to make big changes.” + Commitment, confidence and leadership – some assembly members suggested “it shows commitment to the target” or “gives confidence it is being taken seriously.” Others liked that it showed “government leadership enforcing action.” + Simple and clear – some assembly members said it “sets out a clear picture, a clear signal” or labelled it a “simple effective solution.” + Will make change happen – some assembly members liked that “it forces the change”, “will make sure change happens – drives compliance”, or that the change “will happen as [it’s] in law.” + It works – some assembly members said “it works”, that the “approach has worked in the past”, or that it’s a “proven approach.” + Economy and skills – some assembly members suggested there would be “increased business for plumbers/heating engineers” or that there could be “up-skilling of workers to be able to fit new types of boilers – long-run benefits.” + Cost – some assembly members suggested it would lead to “competitive pricing as purchase guaranteed” or that it would be “cost effective.” + “Cleaner”  Cons − Cost – some assembly members expressed concerns about “affordability”, the “financial impact” or that it “could be expensive.” Some noted that “hydrogen is more expensive than natural gas so it will be difficult to convince people to change” or said “houses will need to be energy efficient or bills will be extremely high.” Some talked about “cost – new things are more expensive” or suggested it “harms the incentive for competitive pricing.” Some asked “who is going to pay?” or said it “will require government lending to householders.” − Won’t work in all areas – some assembly members said it’s “still not tackling the issue in areas without gas connections” or that their support was impacted by “not knowing which areas will have hydrogen networks.” − Technology isn’t ready – some assembly members suggested it “might not work”, that the “technology [is] not ready” or that the “timescale is not realistic.” Some noted it “hasn’t been trailed on a large scale (early shortages)” or queried “is it definitely the right option? Research needed.” − Lack of understanding – some assembly members said that “people may not understand what to do” or that we “need education because people might not understand about the alternatives.” Others noted that “hydrogen is a scary word – don’t know how it works. People are afraid of it going bang!”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  221  − Unpopular – some assembly members felt it “might be unpopular” or “may alienate some people.” − Gas boilers obsolete – some assembly members disliked that the “gas boiler will be obsolete if gas supply is switched off” or said it “will lead to old boilers even though functional – add to waste problem.” − “Disruption to people as houses need to be made more efficient at the same time”  Some assembly members noted ‘conditions’ that they would want to see in place for this policy to be implemented:   Coordination – some assembly members said we “need to coordinate when gas [is] turned off” or that we “need to make sure there is a clear plan in place for switching over.” Others said we “will need coordination between hydrogen supply/heat pumps and boilers”;    Education and information – some assembly members said we need to “educate and inform people clearly, advertising”, or that there will need to be “education in smart technology.” Some said they would support the policy “as long as there is good information and plenty of warning”;    Readiness of alternatives – some assembly members said they would support it if “the technology is there”, or if there is “an attractive alternative.” Some said that “ecofriendly alternatives need to be available and affordable in time for legislation”;    Time to implement – some assembly members asked for “a longer transition period”;    Enforcement – some assembly members asked “how do we make sure that after 2030 existing boilers are quickly take out of service”? Others suggested “why not turn off all gas suppliers?” Some queried “what is the need for gas after carbon zero?”;    Carbon capture and storage – some assembly members said that “if [it’s] blue hydrogen then [we will] need more carbon capture and storage.”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  222  Changes to product standards There are legal standards applied to energy-using products. This policy option would involve the government strengthening these standards to make sure products are more efficient and also ‘smart’. ‘Smart’ products are connected to the internet and the electricity grid, so that they can respond to demand on the grid. For example, a fridge might turn off if there is a short period of high demand for electricity. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about changes to product standards.  Pros + Money-saving – some assembly members suggested it “will save people money”, will “save money in the long run”, “will save energy and money” or “saves money [by] using electricity efficiently.” Others said it would result in “cheaper electricity.” Some talked about “purchase power over a longer period” or suggested it “should bring the price of higher rated (more efficient) appliances down.” + More efficient – some assembly members liked that “products become more energy efficient”, suggesting that this policy option would “encourage [the] market” to make this change. Others liked that it “increase[s] efficiency”, or that it “reduces energy consumption by more efficient devices.” Some said that “it is a good idea to improve standards and make products more energy efficient” or that it’s “good to improve efficiency and safety standards.” + Will (help) create change – some assembly members suggested it would “empower tenants to demand higher quality” or “makes [sure] landlords and house owners reach a certain standard.” Some said it “tightens rules on home efficiency across the board.” + User control – some assembly members liked that “owners can track usage in comparison to [the] national/local average using smart enabled devices” or said it “allows for flexible user control.” + No behaviour change – some assembly members said “making smart devices removes the need of retraining people’s habits” or liked “the ability for a ‘chip’ to make the decision for you to use cheaper electricity.” + Onus on manufacturers not consumers – some assembly members liked that it “puts [the] emphasis on manufacturers to meet high standards” or that the “onus is on manufacturers not consumers to make better choices – it’s easy.” Some said it would have “minimal impact on consumers. + Innovation and the economy – some assembly members said it would lead to “increased innovation through demand for smart tech” or that it “encourages companies to invest in R&D to improve products.” Others suggested that “if UK companies have to innovate it makes the economy more competitive.” + “Building on an existing system” + “Obviously good to do” + “Ease of use (using smart tech)” + “Gets rid of cowboy/counterfeit products”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  223  Cons − Data protection and security risks – some assembly members labelled it “intrusive” or said “[I] don’t want to share my data.” Others said “data protection regulation currently needs strengthening”, that there should be “clear regulations on data protection – big brother” or that they had “data protection concerns and [concerns about] security.” Some assembly members highlighted “security issues regarding smart connections”, the “risk of [a] data breach” or the “risk of hacking or IT failure compromising homes.” Some assembly members suggested that “smart technology may lead to unwanted adverts.” − Cost – some assembly members worried about the “affordability of new products”, or said the “purchase price is higher.” Others said it is “expensive to repair more complex products – [you] can’t do [it] yourself.” Some assembly members reported that “smart tech hasn’t saved …[us] money”, asked “if green energy costs more how will I save money?” or expressed “concern that cost savings may not happen.” − Not everyone is tech savvy – some assembly members felt it “might marginalise less tech savvy groups” or noted that “’smart’ products are not universally popular, especially amongst the elderly.” Others said that it’s “harder to understand smart technology” or talked about the “knowledge cost of using IT.” − Safety – some assembly member said that “making things ‘smart’ is a concern – if things run when you are asleep or out (e.g. tumble dryer fires).” Others queried “any hygiene/safety implementations if a fridge is too warm and can’t power-up for several hours?” − “Punishes recent installations/those who invested in other sustainable heating” − “Restricting times that smart products can be used would be unpopular” − “Increased electricity demand to power all the smart tech” − “Nothing forcing people to replace their efficient old products” − “Like VW emissions scandal – could they claim to be energy efficient when not?”  Some assembly members noted ‘conditions’ that they would want to see in place for this policy to be implemented:   What the standard is – some noted that it “needs to be [a] responsible long term standard”;    Cost – some said they would support it “if it leads to cost savings”;    Separate ‘efficiency’ from ‘smart’ – some said “energy efficiency and ‘smart’ should be considered differently”;    Privacy – some said the “consumer needs to be prioritised (privacy)”;    Education – some noted a “need for education to use smart technology”;    Timing – some said “if cheaper electricity is earlier in the day, it would be safe to have ‘smart’ controls”, or that they would support the policy “if [the] variable rate happens at different times, depending on supply and demand.”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  224  Requirements for selling and renting This would involve a requirement for each home to reach a certain level of energy efficiency. You couldn’t sell or rent a home that did not reach this level. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about this policy option.  Pros + More efficient homes – some assembly members liked that “houses will be more energy efficient”, that “better/more efficient homes will be available” or that “homes will be more efficient if they meet the standard.” Some said it “brings up [the] base level.” + Speed of change – some assembly members suggested it “will speed up the overall upgrade programme”, “forces homes to get more efficient” or “will force people’s hand to adhere to [the] standard, making efficiency a priority.” Some felt it would “phase out bad building practices” or that “it would help to reach net zero.” + Better for tenants – some assembly members liked that it “forces landlords to invest in [a] house (but issue of money)”, “creates a guarantee for tenants of maintenance” or “exposes/ [puts] pressure on rogue landlords/builders.” Some said it would make the “EPC more important for rental standards” or that it’s “good for tenants… comfier house.” + Peace of mind for buyers and tenants – related to the above, some assembly members felt it would “give confidence and peace of mind to tenants and buyers that properties will meet a minimum standard” or provide “re-assurance for potential buyers/tenants to see actual proof of energy efficiency.” Others talked about “peace of mind for house purchasers” or said it would mean “buyers can be confident of the home.” Some said it “sets [a] minimum standard – everyone can understand.” + Reduced bills – some assembly members liked that it “reduc[es] bills for new owners/ tenants as homes more efficient” or that “tenants save money.” + Health benefits – some noted that there would be “improved living standards and health, including mental health – less stress” or “health benefits from warmer and drier homes.” + “New homes already meet these standards so there is a group of houses that don’t require changes” + “Dynamically includes the energy efficiency of a house to its value – improvements are an investment” + “Relatively easy to add onto existing survey” + “Directly includes both renters and home owners”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  225  Cons − Those who cannot afford to make changes will be stuck – some assembly members suggested that “people who have to sell, for hardship reasons, may not be able to afford to do the work to reach the standard” or that it would be “problematic for people who might need to sell due to [a] change in circumstances (can’t afford to make [the] upgrade).” Some asked “what happens with social care – selling house to pay if low rating?”, “what if you cannot afford to meet the requirements – may lead to [a] housing trap”, or “what do you do with houses that require renovation – how do we sell.” Others suggested that “poorer families may struggle to sell homes”, that it requires a “financial outlay which may not be available when trying to sell”, or expressed concerns about “affordability.” − Stress and delays – some assembly members said it “could seriously delay essential house moves” or “could cause stress to [the] household.” − Cost to landlords / homeowners and tenants – some assembly members said it “will put a stop to landlord income temporarily” or be an “added cost on [the] homeowner.” Others said “it will put up rents”, that “landlords may pass on costs to tenants” or that it will be “more expensive…as landlords try to recoup costs.” Some asked “where there is a mix of rented/owner occupied housing, how could that be managed?” − Older properties are disadvantaged – some assembly members suggested that “people in older properties are disadvantaged” or that the “biggest challenge [is] for older properties – may actively reduce value.” Others said it “would be illegal to buy/sell old properties to renovate.” − Shoddy upgrades or assessments – some assembly members worried that it “could encourage ‘shoddy’ upgrades.” Others noted a “risk of subjective home assessments” or asked “who funds the system and assessors? Where does the money come from?” − “People don’t like investing to be able to sell” − “Could have a HUGE impact on the housing market – the housing market is a big part of the UK economy” − “Invasive every man’s/woman’s home is his/her castle”  Some assembly members noted ‘conditions’ that they would want to see in place for this policy to be implemented:   May need different rules for different types of homes – some assembly members asked do “listed buildings [have] different rules?” or “are listed buildings exempt?” Others queried “what about houses for redevelopment?” or “empty, derelict, or run-down homes which property developers might want to buy and do up: what happens to this part of the market?” Some said “what constitutes a ‘house’ (e.g. an old barn or similar)?”, “what about house sales when the buyer wishes to extend?” or noted “every home is different”;    Different types of landlord – some assembly members suggested a “happy balance [is] needed between professional landlords and accidental landlords”;  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  226    Quality assurance – some assembly members asked “can it work [with the afore] mentioned ‘MOT for houses’?” or said it needs “reliable assessors, like Corgi with relevant expertise.” Others said we “must have guarantees that the work has been done well, linked to [a] regulatory body”;    Who pays – some assembly members asked “who is going to pay – will change attitudes to the question”;    Culture shift – some assembly members said “having a more efficient home should increase the value of a home – does this need a culture shift?”;    Date certainty – some assembly members said those responsible should “set a date for this to be implemented.”  Vote results Assembly members voted by secret ballot on policy options around standard setting. There were two ballot papers. The first ballot paper asked assembly members how much they agreed or disagreed that each policy option should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. The second ballot paper asked them to rank the options in their order of preference. The votes from this second ballot paper were counted both in terms of first preference votes and via Borda count.

E.4 Incentives Assembly members looked at four options around incentives:   Changing council tax or stamp duty;    Green mortgages;    Government-backed loans;    Changes to VAT.  We start by presenting the rationale for their views, taking each policy option in turn.

The levels of either could be adjusted so that you pay less tax for a home that has lower emissions. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about changing council tax or stamp duty.  Pros + Incentivises change – some assembly members said it’s “another measure towards pushing homebuyers or people that rent to ‘greener’ options”, that “it will encourage people to make changes, will be an incentive”, or that it “encourages home owners to improve homes to cut tax.” Others said it’s “good to have incentives for homeowners who have new builds” or that it “incentivises estate agents to advertise efficient homes – raises awareness of ways of improving homes.” Some commented that “people can start straight away with investing and not wait (when this is in place).” + Good for housing market and certain types of houses – some assembly members said it “may reinvigorate the housing market.” Others suggested that “cuts in stamp duty may stimulate sales of smaller houses” or that the “stamp duty incentive [is] good for new builds.” + Less tax and stamp duty is good, including for tenants – some assembly members said it’s a “good reason for reducing stamp duty!” or that “council tax benefits would be a continuous benefit.” Others said that “changing council tax can help landlords and tenants” or that it’s “good for tenants if [the] landlord has had to increase rent to cover home improvements – get a bit back on council tax.” Some said “if you take action and have a ‘green’ home you are rewarded as you pay less tax.” + “Possible good short-term win” + “Fair for people already invested to making their house more efficient without using any future government funding” + “Could control your situation by choice of home” + “Everyone is affected not just owners”  Cons − Disadvantages the less well-off – some assembly members said it would “disadvantage homeowners who can’t afford the improvements (i.e. get a loan or re-mortgage)”, “would penalise the poor more than the rich” or “may marginalise [the] lower middle class from selling homes.” − Unfair on older properties and those needing more work – some suggested that “some homes may not be able to get to a higher level of energy efficiency so wouldn’t get a tax reduction.” Others said specifically that it’s “taxing older properties unfairly”, that “older properties [would be] disadvantaged” or that it “doesn’t seem to be a viable incentive for older buildings.”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  230  − Penalising tenants – some assembly members worried that “tenants [would] pay higher council tax because landlords won’t allow changes to [their] property” or that “low income householders / renters might have to pay more, when it’s not in their control to make their home more efficient.” − Expensive – some assembly members noted that the “homeowner has to get [the] home to [be] energy efficient first – money for that?” or that “some homes need way more done for it to reach energy efficient…expensive… people won’t do it.” Some said it “it will take a long time to see the financial benefits.” − Councils will end up with less funding – some assembly members noted that “if it’s council tax the Local Authority will have less money to spend and they are strapped for cash already” or expressed “concern that it will mean councils have less money to fund services.” Others asked “would council tax tariffs change drastically” or suggested we “may end up being taxed elsewhere to make up for [the] shortfall made by council tax.” − Complex and confusing – some assembly members said it “won’t work – much too complex”, that it “could be complex to change” or that “stamp duty incentives seem complicated.” Others suggested that “constantly changing parameters for efficiency may confuse home owners.” − Negative impact on housing market – some assembly members highlighted that “stamp duty changes might have a negative impact on [the] housing market, if prices go up” or that “house prices could go up.” − “The buyer is penalised for the seller’s inefficient home” − “Would be full of loopholes and anomalies” − “Would breed discontent” − “Tax rises can be seen as a penalty / negative – rather than a positive for improving the planet” − “Can we trust government to not use this as a money making scheme.”  Some assembly members noted ‘conditions’ that they would want to see in place for this policy to be implemented:   Protect council income – some assembly members said they would support the policy “if the overall amount councils get in stays the same or goes up” or asked “re council tax – is there another way of using it to compensate homeowners which doesn’t reduce [the] income of the Local Authority? Others said “if [the] right banding was put in place it may work.”    Provide support – some assembly members said they would support the policy “if all councils set aside an amount to fund climate change work, to help people who can’t afford [to make their properties] energy efficient.”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  231  Green mortgages This would involve government encouraging or requiring mortgage providers to offer ‘green mortgages’ at cheaper rates to people in lower carbon homes. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about this policy option.  Pros + Works as an incentive – some assembly members suggested it would “mak[e] more people interested in going carbon neutral”, “encourages buying low carbon homes”, “encourages house sellers to make homes more energy efficient” or “encourages retrofit etc so homeowners can switch [their] mortgage to a cheaper green one.” Others said it is “appealing to go for a green mortgage as it is cheaper”, that it’s “only low level but is a positive incentive” or that “providing [a] mortgage rather than [a] loan strengthens the significance of the efficiency improvements.” + Stimulates green building – some assembly members felt it “will drive a market for green homes to exist”, that it “incentivises low carbon homes sale / production” or will “stimulate more ‘green’ building.” Some commented that “all new homes should be able to qualify for a green mortgage.” + Helps some, including first time buyers – some assembly members said it “could particularly help first time buyers”, “could assist first time buyers” or would be “good for first time buyers.” Others suggested it “could improve prospects for renters” or “would help people who want to buy their Local Authority or Housing Association rented home as [their] house [is] more likely to be a low carbon home.” + “Green mortgages are already being sold” + “Cheaper mortgage payments” + “Home owners prepared to bring their homes to a level ‘A’ should be able to claim a green mortgage” + “People may feel better not dealing with a ‘government organisation’” + “Green mortgages will create jobs and employment to improve and update” + “Could apply to landlords and may reduce rent” + “They have a place and would like to see them available as a part of a wider scheme”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  232  Cons − Only helps some, and excludes tenants – some assembly members said that “landlords may not pass on savings to tenants”, or that it “excludes renters.” Others said it “only supports those that buy”, “only benefits the better off homebuyers” or that it is “not applicable to those who are not buying a house – covers only a fraction of houses.” Some agreed saying it “doesn’t help everyone – only applies to those who own their own homes”, or is “only for people who own property, [a] lot of people would not benefit.” Some suggested that a “lot of people’s credit ratings would not qualify.” − Timescale to see benefits – some assembly members disliked the “timescale to see any benefits for a lot of effort” or said that “landlords would not see [a] return on [their] extra investment for many years, so [there’s] little incentive for the rental market.” − Won’t work – some assembly members asked “what incentives are there for banks [to offer]… lower rates”, “how would they incentivise banks?” or said “with interest rates already so low, how will this work in practice.” Others commented “only low impact – most of [the] benefit [is] likely to be absorbed by fees.” Some assembly members felt it “isn’t an incentive for everyone – some people want to keep [an] old style” or “other factors [are] far more important for buyers e.g. location.” − Unfair – some assembly members suggested that there would be a “perceived unfairness – funded indirectly by people who don’t own property through [their] taxes.” Others talked about “home improvements / extensions”, saying “may affect eligibility for green mortgages. Therefore once [a] mortgage has been awarded, if home improvements reduce efficiency (conservatory?) you still reap benefits.” − “Impact on sellers – if you haven’t done the work to make it efficient, you can’t sell to move into a greener home” − “Could distort the housing market” − “The cost of checking for ‘lower carbon’” − “It’s a short-term thing because soon all homes will be efficient”  Some assembly members noted ‘conditions’ that they would want to see in place for this policy to be implemented:   Some assembly members made points about ensuring the policy works for different groups of people. Some said it “needs to work for existing homeowners who might be renovating their home”, and others that “people’s circumstances change and [those responsible should] consider [a] way to have a break paying loans back short term.” Some asked “are they available to everyone (e.g. first time buyers)?” Others said they had a “question / potential concern: would ‘normal’ mortgages be more expensive as a result?”;    Some assembly members wanted to see a bigger incentive. Some suggested that those responsible should “make the value of [a] home higher if [it’s] more energy efficient: would be more [of an] incentive to make improvements.” Others said “if interest rates go up [it] could be more beneficial.”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  233  Others assembly members asked “who decides on qualifying homes” or suggested “a lump sum one-off payment off the mortgage because of concern about government involvement: poor experience of dealing with government.”  Government-backed loans This would involve government working with banks or other lenders to offer loans with low or no interest. This would spread the cost of home improvements, including for energy efficiency measures and zero carbon heating. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about government-backed loans.  Pros + Works as incentive – some assembly members felt it “would act as an incentive”, that “low interest / zero interest will encourage take up”, that “no interest loans [are] a good incentive” or that it “could incentivise homeowners to make [the] full suite of improvements.” Some noted that you “don’t have to pay all at once if [you] don’t have all the money for improvements so more people will upgrade [their] home.” Others said it “will encourage people to take it up if [a] law [is] passed to improve standards.” + Trust / confidence in a government loan – some assembly members said that “as it would be a government scheme it would provide confidence to homeowners” or that “government backing is nice: people trust government loans.” Others suggested that it “could make taking the loan ‘safer’ (better regulated, safer provider, more focussed purposes).”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  234  + “May take financial pressure off to raise funds to upgrade your home” + “You no longer have financial liability when you sell your home (a loan would stay with you)” + “Government may be able to borrow at a cheaper rate than individuals” + “Available to everyone – fair” + “Reduces the amount of research people have to do into alternative loan providers” + “May encourage increase in co-operatives / non-profits to help households become more efficient”  Cons − Taxation and government borrowing – some assembly members said they “don’t agree with taxpayers’ money being used”, that it “could be costly to taxpayers” or will “caus[e] higher taxes to pay for it.” Some suggested it “may require taxation / government borrowing.” − Liability is against the person, not property – some assembly members asked “what would the loan be secured against” or said there is “uncertainty [about] if [the] loan is tied to property or person.” Others disliked that the “liability remains with you even after [the] sale of [the] house” or asked “what about if you sell the house but still have a loan to pay off?” − People could default – some assembly members noted that “people’s circumstances may change a lot over the time of the loan” or asked “what certainty is there over the period of [the] loan: can it be ‘recalled’ at any time?” Others said that “householders may default on loans if [they are] not structured properly.” − Time taken to pay it off, if it’s paid off at all – some assembly members said it “may take a long time to pay off” or “may end up like student loans, poorer people can never pay.” Others said it “not clear how it’s going to be paid” or expressed “concern about [the] experience of student loans.” − Not everyone can benefit – some assembly members suggested it “only benefits the welloff”, that “not everyone would be eligible” or that “not everyone will have the extra money to pay back a loan.” − Increases debt – some assembly members disliked that it “increases debt”, or “encourages more debt.” − Won’t work – some assembly members suggested that “there might not be demand for them if there is no obligation to make changes”, that “landlords may not upgrade” or that “if solely imposed [they] will not attract people who rent their house – no benefit for them through reduced bills.” − “Lack of trust in the government – prefer a one-off lump sum” − “Governments could abuse loans to raise capital (like 6.5% interest on student loans)” − “High recovery administration costs for government”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  235  Some assembly members noted ‘conditions’ that they would want to see in place for this policy to be implemented:   Who is liable – some assembly members said that “if the loan is on the house, not the homeowner, and the repayments become the responsibility of the buyer not the older owner (because the person gets the benefit) would need to be transparent to buyer?”;    Cross–party agreement and long-term certainty – some assembly members said it “would need cross-party agreement for the long-term certainty of the policy / loan”;    Offer low interest to all – some suggested that it “could be of benefit to homeowners provided the loans are offered to all at a low interest rate”;    Who gets loans – some said that “some people may struggle to ever pay [it] back so [thought should be given to] who gets loans.”  Changes to VAT VAT is currently paid on some energy efficiency and zero carbon heating products, including efficient window glazing, some boilers, and DIY insulation measures. Rates are between 5% and 20% and are added to the cost of the products. Removing or reducing this VAT would make these products cheaper. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about changes to VAT.  Pros + Encourages and promotes retrofitting – some assembly members said it would “encourage us to think about carbon emissions – 0% VAT for carbon zero”, “offers some incentive”, or that it “encourages people to make changes – 20% is a big saving.” Some said that “any measures to help people to make their homes more energy efficient cheaper must be welcome” or liked that it “targets energy efficiency e.g. retrofitting.” Others commented that “in contrast with applying higher taxes, cutting VAT ensures that these efficient products are more attractive.” + Quick and easy to implement – some assembly members suggested it “can be put forward quickly and easily”, is “easy to make into law / implement” or is “easy to implement.” + Increases employment – some assembly members felt it would “increase employment in this sector” or “creates demand for green products and new jobs.” + Popular, beneficial and easy to understand – some assembly members suggested it would be “good publicity to reduce VAT”, that it was “easy to understand” and would be “popular with voters.” Others said there was a “benefit (but small benefit)” or that “everyone will make a saving.” + Reduction in energy use/bills – some assembly members suggested that, by encouraging people to make their homes more efficient, it would result in a “reduction in total energy use” or “may reduce your energy bills.” + Market innovation – some assembly members felt it “encourages market innovation” or provides a “financial incentive for energy efficient products and services.”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  236  Cons − Loss of government revenue stream and its implications – some assembly members disliked that it involves a “loss of revenue for government”, a “slight loss of government revenue” or that it “reduce[s] government revenue.” Some suggested it could “cause conflict re government spending” or asked if “other taxes [would] go up to compensate?” − Minor incentive – some assembly members felt it is “only a minor incentive”, that it “might not make enough difference to the price”, or “will only be equal to a small saving.” Others said we would be “directing central funds into the situation but less efficiently than a focussed grant.” − Might not lead to cheaper prices – some assembly members queried “if VAT was removed would companies increase prices” or wondered “would people actually end up saving money, and see that they have?“ − “Might not reduce CO2 dramatically enough” − “High administration cost and complexity” − “Unfair to people who have already become energy efficient” − “For SME contractors, will this make an impact on their VAT registration?”  Some assembly members noted ‘conditions’ that they would want to see in place for this policy to be implemented:   Not enough by itself – some assembly members said it “definitely needs to be done alongside something else because not enough. What if still not affordable for some people – those people just won’t be able to bring in new products”;    Clarity on savings – some assembly members said they would support it “if bills are very clear, and you know what real saving you’ve made (e.g. might contractors put their prices up to compensate?)”;    Advertise it well – some assembly members said it “would need to be well advertised”;    Use reclaims – some suggested that the VAT “could be reclaimed.”  Some assembly members suggested that “the devil will be in the detail with all of these options.”  Vote results Assembly members voted by secret ballot on policy options around incentives. There were two ballot papers. The first ballot paper asked assembly members how much they agreed or disagreed that each policy option should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. The second ballot paper asked them to rank the options in their order of preference. The votes from this second ballot paper were counted both in terms of first preference votes and via Borda count.

Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  239  E.5 Roles and powers Assembly members looked at four options around roles and powers:   Changing energy market rules;    Support for smaller organisations;    Local plans for zero carbon homes;    Enforcing district heating networks.  We start by presenting the rationale for their views, taking each policy option in turn.  Jump to the vote results on page 248  Changing energy market rules This would involve changing the rules governing energy markets to allow more companies to compete. This could, for example, enable companies to sell energy services like ‘heat as a service’. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about changing energy market rules.  Pros + Increases competition and is better for consumers – some assembly members said it would “create competition”, or that “increased competition is a good thing for consumers.” Some suggested that it “could result in cheaper tariffs for consumers”, “opens up [the] market/increases [the] potential for competitive pricing” or would lead to “more competition in the energy sector – could lead to price reductions.” Others said that “increased competition [would promote] fairness for consumers”, that it “opens up more options” or that they “would be open to more options as an individual.” Some said it would give “increased control to consumers and possibl[y] reduced costs” or that it gives “greater flexibility to [the] consumer.” + Increased innovation – some assembly members said that “increased competition [would mean] better options – more innovation” or that changing the rules would “stimulat[e] [the] need for innovation.” Some suggested that “small companies might work with bigger companies where they have new green initiatives to offer which big companies had not thought of.” + Could reduce fuel poverty – some assembly members felt that “once rules are finalised (including what happens to poorer households etc) [there could be] many positives.” Others said it “may reduce fuel poverty e.g. GPs prescribe heat to [the] elderly.” + Easier and simpler – some assembly members suggested that providing ‘heat as a service’ would be “simpler for consumers to understand”, “clearer for some people to see what they are paying for” or that it “could be an opportunity to simply some things.” + “If people are more aware of their energy use there is an incentive to reduce consumption”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  240  Cons − Complicated and confusing – some assembly members expressed “concerns that packages might be complicated”, that it “could be more complicated” or that it “could be more complicated for householders to decide?” Others said that “anything which makes things more complex is problematic” or that “too much competition may be confusing – you may not know what is best – too many options.” Some said “too much choice.” − Could lead to price increases – some assembly members suggested that the “consumer could pay more” or that “changing [the] rules is not guaranteed to provide better value.” Some asked “could surge pricing happen?” or commented that “opening up electricity to more companies was not wholly successful, eventually will raise prices.” − Concerns about online – some assembly members expressed concerns that it “will it mean more online communication which some people find hard” or that it “could be heavily reliant on technology – may alienate some groups.” Others highlighted that it could be “vulnerable to cyber-crime e.g. people’s data.” − Rules, regulation and monitoring – some assembly members disliked that you “need more regulation” or that “more competition means more rules.” Some suggested that “changing rules causes more short-term disruption” or commented “unknown consequences, loopholes, could be harder to monitor.” − “Would co-ops/small companies reduce employment (marketing, advocacy etc)”  Some assembly members noted ‘conditions’ that they would want to see in place for this policy to be implemented:   Oversight and regulation – some assembly members said there needed to be “oversight of the market” or that the “role of regulators may need to change.” Others called for “simple regulation [and] close regulation”;    Consumer focused – some assembly members talked about the need for “consumer focused regulation” or “consumer focused support and advice.” Others asked for information to be provided in “plain English!”;    Rewarding loyalty – some assembly members said that “loyalty (of customers) should be rewarded – it is tiring to keep switching – bad experiences of switching”;    Support to switch – some said “keep the schemes which help you switch providers easily, and Ofgem/Ombudsman are still in place”;    Take account of vulnerable people – some assembly members said “any changes should take account the most vulnerable people.”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  241  Support for smaller organisations This would involve providing support for smaller organisations to offer energy services. Organisations impacted would include small companies, co-operatives and non-profit organisations. Examples of the support they might receive include reduced tax rates, less regulation, or obligations for big companies to work with co-operatives and community organisations. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about support for smaller organisations.  Pros + Better and more tailored support for local needs – some assembly suggested that “smaller local based organisations can address better the different needs in different areas”, that it “utilises organisations with local knowledge” or that it “may mean services are better tailored to local situations e.g. coastal holiday seasonal locations.” Others said it “will open up more choice, local and community level might give a better personal service”, that organisations would be “easier to communicate with” or that “smaller organisations give better customer service.” Some suggested these organisations were “more likely to offer support to local communities and [the] less well off” or that there would be “better local engagement.” + Trustworthy – some assembly said “householders can use smaller companies known to them and who they can trust” or that it would be “more trustworthy as local.” Others commented: “More social and community and trust and engagement so more people asking and understanding things.” + Support for co-ops – some assembly members said that they are “very pro co-ops getting involved” or that “co-ops [are] not for profit – good for communities.” + Creates greater choice and lower prices – some assembly members commented that it would mean “more choice for consumers” or that “more competition may lead to lower prices.” + Greater Innovation – some assembly members said it would “help with start-ups and innovations”, would bring in “new ideas!!” or that “smaller companies may be more innovative.” + “Easy to implement” + “Small is good” + “Like the idea of doing retrofit this way”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  242  Cons − How to define and make fair the difference between small and big organisations – some assembly members asked “how do we determine who is a small company?” or “where does the support end?” Others said that it’s “unfair to have different rules for different companies” or that it “may affect investment in bigger companies.” − Complex market and increased regulation – some assembly members said it “could make the market very complicated”, that “more complicated = more costly” or that they “don’t want too much government regulation.” − Costs – some assembly members disliked the “cost of investigation [to ensure quality provision by small companies]” or the “extra cost in subsidies for government (who pays?).” − Quality of service might be lower – some assembly members suggested that “small companies need to be investigated for quality control”, that there could be “bad service/lack of incentive” or that “if you are on the ‘border’ between organisations’ areas, you may not be able to access the better service.” − “Take away jobs (especially starter)” − “What is to stop larger companies taking advantage – set up small companies (loop holes)” − “Unnecessary. If the bigger companies can benefit from smaller companies they will and people already use small local people” − “Smaller companies might not have financial backing of bigger firms e.g. for investment, economies of scale of business failure. Will they be able to offer …deals and be less harsh with late payment” − “Smaller = less well known” − “More different offers may be confusing”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  243  Some assembly members noted ‘conditions’ that they would want to see in place for this policy to be implemented:   Information for consumers – some assembly members highlighted that “people need to know where they can go for support e.g. Ofgem”, that there should be “clear education on options for people” or that there needs to be a “climate advice bureau!”;    Regulation and supervision – some assembly members suggested that there may need to be “an Ofgem for smaller companies?”, that there “would need [to be] regulation/ supervision”, or that there is a “need [for]…accountability.” Some said there should be “overall rules for all large companies to share expertise with non-profit etc organisations”;    Support vulnerable people and smaller businesses – some assembly members said that “any changes should take account [of] the most vulnerable people and have support systems, and backing for the smaller businesses.”  Local plans for zero carbon homes This would involve central government giving local authorities the powers and resources to develop an area-wide plan for moving to zero carbon homes. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about this policy option.  Pros + Local knowledge and control – some assembly members said that “local knowledge and control should deliver better outcomes for local areas”, that it “will make better use of local knowledge” or that it is “good to take account of [the] different needs of local areas.” Others suggested it would be “more well-suited and not ‘one size fits all’” or that “they can organise and fund local projects e.g. district heating.” + Local council involvement – relatedly, some assembly members said that “local councils should have a better idea of the circumstances and requirements of their own local area” or that “local authorities will have better understanding and experience of their resources and options for zero carbon homes.” Others suggested that “local authorities need to be involved” or that “local authorities want their area to improve and they understand it.” Some stated “it is essential that central government provide the financial resources for local authorities to implement a local plan for moving to zero carbon houses.” + More accountable – some assembly members liked the idea of “local accountability” or said it “should be more accountable.” Some commented “local power held to account – no one else to blame.” + “Should be a speedier process” + “Possibly more chance for input” + “Could be more local enthusiasm” + “May end up providing more funding to local authorities”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  244  Cons − Local variation – some assembly members said it “could result in too much variation throughout UK”, that there is “no central UK co-ordination e.g. different areas at different paces etc” or that “local plans may end in some areas staying behind in improvements – central co-ordination may be preferable.” Others talked about “how to ensure it is fair to everyone no matter where you live.” − Issues around funding – some assembly members asked “where will funding come from” or “if additional funds are required where do they come from?” Others commented that it “might be hard to fund it – depends on how rich the local authority is”, or that “some areas are more well-off so some people may not get as much help.” Some suggested that a “lack of funding could lead to missed targets and increased costs.” − Lack of trust in local authorities – some assembly members asked “do you trust your local authority?” or said “some people don’t trust their local authorities so might not want what is being put into place.” Others questioned “what stops local areas for making pricey mistakes and who pays?” − “Could be difficult to access expertise” − “Might stop people from taking initiative to price compare” − “Local vested interests could distort sensible action” − “A lot of diversity within even a small community = may be very broad advice” − “Might local authority boundaries get in the way of the best solutions” − “Will big business have influence [over] the plans and [make those responsible] do something different?”  Some assembly members noted ‘conditions’ that they would want to see in place for this policy to be implemented:   Local councils need adequate funding and powers – some assembly members said that “central government needs to invest in and trust local authorities”, that those responsible “need to ensure they [local authorities] get the correct funding” or that “some local authorities will face bigger challenges due to lack of resources so there needs to be a formulated plan of fair funding from central government.” Some assembly members asked “will local authorities have the power to insist on their plans and not be overruled by central government.” Others stated that “local authorities need to be able to invest”;    Fairness and transparency – some assembly members commented that it “needs a lot of transparency in developing and implementing the plan” or that “once resources are provided there should be a recognised/agreed criteria by which it is allocated.” Some said that “local authorities need to give support fairly within their area.” Others asked “who decides [the] criteria for ‘home’?”;    Delivery models – some assembly members said their support “depends on [the] delivery model.” Others said “local authorities need to have special climate change departments (some already do) for the wellbeing of the local people”;  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  245    Enforcement – some assembly members said that “if central government gives the powers to local authorities then they should enforce penalties/sanctions if targets aren’t met.”  Enforcing district heating networks This would involve local authorities requiring developers – and possibly individual buildings and homes – to connect to heat networks. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about this policy option.  Pros + Cheaper – some assembly members suggested it has a “very cheap operating cost” or that “overall [it] should be cheaper to use.” Others said it “could save money in long-term” or “should reduce people’s bills.” + Not reliant on choice – some assembly members liked that it is an “enforced change – not reliant on people making choices”, that it is “not reliant on individuals changing” or that it “gets it done, makes it happen.” + Local – some assembly members liked that it is “more controlled by local authorities” or that “local authorities can take account of local opinions within national guidelines.” Others suggested it would be “good for local communication.” + Works for new developments – some assembly members said it is “good for new development i.e. it will work for new developments” or that “builders / developers will know in advance that this is required.” + Impact and speed – some assembly members said it “has large impact quickly for an area” or that it is “ready to implement quickly.” + Uses waste heat – some assembly members liked that it “can use waste heat” or said it’s “crazy to let heat go to waste.” + “Use the heat directly, without a storage problem” + “Will fit with current planning rules and procedures” + “A plan within a plan” + “Might generate income for e.g. hospital” + “Will be done as it is the law” + “Cleaner in providing than hydrogen/heat pump” + “Spread carbon cost (more value for carbon spent)” + “Gets disruption to people/households over and done with in one go (before they move in?)”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  246  Cons − Geographically restricted – some assembly members said it is “geographically restricted”, “doesn’t work everywhere”, or is “not suitable for all areas.” Others said it is “not beneficial for rural [areas]” or is “only accessible to a few.” − Only viable for new builds – some assembly members said it will be “difficult to retrofit” or “will be a big challenge to incorporate into existing towns/cities – easier for new housing estates.” Others commented that “this is for new homes and builds – what about existing ones that could potentially be part of [the] network?” or said that “older houses will not be connected to it – it is for new builds.” Some said it “only applies to new houses so by 2050 75% of housing stock will be unaffected” or queried “how effective will it be, if it only applies to new builds or only dense areas.” − Lack of choice – some assembly members disliked that “households have no choice” or that there’s “less individual choice.” Some felt it “could be too aggressive and put people off” or that you would need to “to enforce ideas …[over] resistance.” − Failures affect many people – some assembly members noted that “failure could mean many people affected at [the] same time”, that “if it breaks a lot of people would be affected all at once (similar to a big power cut)” or that “if sources break down lots of people can be without services, heat etc.” Others disliked the “risk of [the] heat source closing down.” − Impact on developers – some assembly members suggested there would be “increased construction costs for housing companies.” Others worried it “might discourage builders from developing in those places” or “stop developments happening where they are needed.” − Monopolies – some assembly members disliked the “potential monopoly” or “monopolies.” − Future needs – some assembly members said “there is a risk included in this choice as the future heating needs of an area may change” or that it “requires forward planning.” − “Disruptive” − “Builders could pass on costs to potential buyers”  Some assembly members noted ‘conditions’ that they would want to see in place for this policy to be implemented:   Where it is used – some assembly members said it “would work better in cities/populated areas rather than [in] rural [locations]”;    Encourage developers – some assembly members said that “developers of new builds should be encouraged to provide [connection to a] district heating network”;    New designs – some assembly members said we “will need estates to be designed in new ways or [that it] will change how estates are designed.”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  247  Vote results Assembly members voted by secret ballot on policy options around roles and powers. There were two ballot papers. The first ballot paper asked assembly members how much they agreed or disagreed that each policy option should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. The second ballot paper asked them to rank the options in their order of preference. The votes from this second ballot paper were counted both in terms of first preference votes and via Borda count.

Levels of disagreement were very low. No assembly members disagreed with ‘support for smaller organisations’. Only ‘enforcing district heating networks’ saw disagreement levels reach higher than 6% (18% of assembly members ‘strongly disagreed’ or ‘disagreed’ with this option).

Under ‘information’, a majority of assembly members backed proposals for carbon MOTs for houses and information and support either provided or funded by government. Assembly members did not back the idea of information and support provided and funded by private companies, citing concerns including potential bias.  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  250  In terms of ‘fairness and consumer protection’, assembly members strongly supported the idea of simpler consumer protection measures, suggesting for example that they would make rules easier to understand, help ensure problems are fixed quickly and protect the vulnerable. A majority of assembly members also supported both government help for everyone and government help for poorer households, with a small majority preferring help for everyone. Their rationale for this preference included that help for everyone would incentivise more people to make changes. Again under the ‘fairness’ theme, assembly members were divided about whether it was better to raise money through adding to all householders’ energy bills or through taxation and government borrowing. A small majority of assembly members preferred ‘adding to all householders’ energy bills’ when faced with a straight choice between the two options. However this idea was also more controversial with more assembly members overall saying that they agreed with taxation and government borrowing. Under ‘standard setting’, large majorities of assembly members backed a ban on sales of new gas boilers (from 2030 or 2035) and changes to product standards to make products more energy efficient and ‘smart’. Their rationale for supporting the ban on new gas boilers included that it would encourage innovation and better technology, and allow people time to plan. They felt that changes to product standards would make products more energy efficient and save people money in the long-run, among other benefits. A majority of assembly members, albeit a smaller one, also supported requirements for selling and renting. In terms of ‘incentives’, a large majority of assembly members backed changes to VAT on energy efficiency and zero carbon heating products, commenting for example that it would encourage and promote retrofitting by making prices lower. A majority of assembly members also supported changing council tax or stamp duty so that people pay less for homes that have lower emissions and green mortgages. A small majority backed government-backed loans for energy efficiency measures and zero carbon heating. Under roles and powers, large majorities of assembly members backed supporting smaller organisations to offer energy services, local plans for zero carbon homes and changing energy market rules to allow more companies to compete. A smaller majority also backed enforcing district heating networks. The following table shows all 19 policy measures backed by a majority of assembly members.

Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  252  F. Anything else to tell government and Parliament At the end of weekend three, assembly members had the opportunity to add any further thoughts on heat and energy use in the home and the path to net zero. We have divided comments into nine themes to make them easier to navigate.  UK-wide leadership   Some assembly members said “we want commitment and clarity.”    Some noted a wish for “cross party support for net zero”, asking “MPs to convince colleagues to support net zero,” and emphasising the “importance of continuity from one government to the next.”    Some said we need to “ensure all government departments address climate change.” Others suggested there “may be [a] need for a dedicated government department and Cabinet minister”, commenting that the “issue needs to be more prominent at Cabinet.”    Some assembly members suggested those responsible should “set up a big national charity to tackle climate change – with tax incentives to give.” Others asked for a “climate bureau”, stating that this is a “crisis.”    Some assembly members said they wanted to “know that they will do what we say and, if not, tell us why not.”  The role of local authorities   Some assembly members asked “central government to work with Local Authorities and N[ational] A[ssemblies] across [the] country to make it happen (starting with policy).”    Some said they “like the idea of local authorities getting involved across all of the actions, to make it suitable for the local area, and take advantage of word-of-mouth.”    Some asked national government to “give more power to local councils and a fair funding plan to tackle heat and energy use in the home – some Local Authorities will have bigger challenges than others.”  Transparency, information and education   Some assembly members asked “could we have a live net zero national meter e.g. on TV/online.”    Some said “citizens are interested in what big businesses can and are doing – tell us!” Some asked for “more transparency around corporate lobbying of government and Parliament.”    Some said “carbon footprint – make it simpler and more relatable – concrete examples e.g. like calorie labelling.”    One assembly said “the complexity of the topics has dawned on me. Can we get everyone this level of education – the level of education that assembly members now have? If we could, we’d be laughing. The complexity of the sacrifices and trade offs. Wider understanding would be the best thing to come out from this assembly.”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  253  Public mood   Some assembly members noted that “there is much more awareness and attention on climate change now”, that “there is momentum” and that “people are getting involved.” Some assembly members said they were “encouraged by humanity… conversations!”    Some suggested that “all the votes (and the reasons people gave) are based around a lack of trust – therefore it’s important that there is more legislation and regulation.”  Planned transition   Some assembly members said “we like (reasonable) target dates and deadlines, with planned transition periods because people take it seriously. [You can] [w]ork towards it and it’s a commitment – gives people a chance to plan. Everybody knows it’s going to happen. Progress can be measured, and people can be held accountable.”  Cost and tax   Some assembly members asked those responsible to “try not to tax the living daylights out of everyone.” One said “if tax increase [is] linked to tackling climate change [it] might lose public support.”    Some assembly members suggested that “people will be reluctant to fork out money if they’re not getting value for it (e.g. investing in retrofitting their home but this not being reflected in the market value).”  Urgency and getting started   Some assembly members said “urgent action [is] required on heat and energy in the home – biggest carbon emission after transport” or that “it’s a national emergency – beyond the pockets of individuals – needs to be a national effort.” Some said “we can get started [now]!”  Global   Some assembly members asked “government to remember [the] global impact of climate change.” Others said we “need global solutions and global support from the UK and other major economies.”  Other   “Be careful not to demonise or move away from large industry / companies too much – because they contribute a lot to the social and economic elements of our society.”    “The solutions aren’t isolated, they are connected so you need to do a combination of everything.”    “Getting the right balance of incentives and penalties” is important.    “Are we going to get enough hydrogen? [especially if we need it at same time]”  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  254  Conclusions Assembly members’ recommendations on heat and energy use in the home show a strong push for action. Assembly members emphasised the need for a long-term strategy with a wide range of actors taking steps to move the sector towards net zero; assembly members strongly supported roles for government investment (80%), local solutions (80%), individual responsibility (80%) and market innovation (80%). They also gave strong backing to a wide range of specific measures to create change. A majority of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that 19 policy measures on heat and energy use in the home should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. Policies supported by at least two-thirds of assembly members were: 1.  Support for smaller organisations to offer energy services (94%);  2.  Simpler consumer protection measures (92%);  3.  Changes to product standards to make products more energy efficient and ‘smart’ (91%);  4.  Local plans for zero carbon homes (89%);  5.  A ban on sales of new gas boilers from 2030 or 2035 (86%);  6.  Changes to energy market rules to allow more companies to compete (86%);  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  255  7.  Changes to VAT on energy efficiency and zero carbon heating products (83%);  8.  Information and support funded by government (83%);  9.  Information and support provided by government (72%);  10. Government help for everyone (69%); 11. Government help for poorer households (68%); 12. Enforcing district heating networks (66%).  Assembly members’ discussions on the above measures and on the ‘in the home’ theme more broadly showed a number of consistent themes:   Assembly members emphasised their support for tailored solutions – enabling local authorities and other local organisations to chose solutions suited to their local areas, and householders to pick the options best for them. They saw local solutions as having additional benefits in helping the local economy and enabling better public engagement;    They also consistently backed measures to increase the choice available to individuals, including through steps to increase competition – measures that some assembly members felt would also lower prices and speed-up innovation. They stressed the need to provide the public with reliable and clear information;    Assembly members were also clear throughout that they want measures to work for all income groups and housing types, not least in terms of financial support to make changes affordable. They stressed the need to remember tenants as well as homeowners.    Some assembly members noted concerns about the influence and behaviour of big companies, and around use of personal data.  Assembly members’ discussions on home retrofits and zero carbon heating picked up on many of these themes:   On home retrofits, assembly members emphasised the need to minimise disruption in the home, put in place support around costs, and offer flexibility and choice to homeowners. They showed a slight preference for upgrading each home all in one go (56%), compared to upgrading each home gradually (44%) but attached conditions to the former around how it is financed. Some assembly members also stressed that this should be a choice for homeowners;  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  256    The best technology to use for zero carbon heating is a matter of significant policy debate. However at least 80% of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that each of hydrogen (83%), heat pumps (80%), and heat networks (80%) should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. 94% of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that “people in different parts of the country should be offered different solutions to zero carbon heating.” They argued that areas should be able to choose the technologies best suited to their needs.  The 23 considerations for government and Parliament that assembly members identified at the start of their discussions – along with the rationale and conditions assembly members noted throughout – provide a valuable guide for policy-makers working on heat and energy use in the home and the path to net zero.  Climate Assembly UK ― In the home  257  Ch ap ter  6  What we eat and how we use the land  Summary of recommendations 1 Assembly members put forward eight considerations for government and Parliament to bear in mind when making decisions about food, farming, land use and the path to net zero. These focussed on: 1 Providing support to farmers; 2 Information and education; 3 Using land efficiently; 4 Rules for large retailers and supermarkets; 5 More local and seasonal food;  3 Assembly members highlighted the need for the above to be combined with support for farmers to make the transition, and policies to ensure changes do not disproportionality affect the less well off. Assembly members said changes should not compromise animal welfare, and expressed strong concerns about GM and lab grown food. They asked for policy-makers to take into account the implications for smaller farms, the suitability of different land for different uses, and differences in impact between UK regions.  6 Making low carbon food more affordable; 7 Some, just less, meat; 8 Considering net zero as part of planning policy and new developments, including support for allotments. 2 Assembly members’ preferred future for food, farming and land use in the UK centred around:       Local produce and local food production – for a wide range of reasons including community benefits, fairer prices for farmers, a ‘feel good factor’ and reduced environmental impacts; A change in diet to reduce meat and dairy consumption by between 20% and 40% – the assembly stressed the significance of education, saying these changes should be voluntary rather than compulsory; A “managed diversity” of land use, including steps such as restoring woodlands, peatlands and gorselands.  4 Assembly members showed strong support for policies to change both farming, food production and land use, and retail and individuals’ behaviour. At least two-thirds ‘agreed’ or ‘strongly agreed’ that nine policies should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. These included:   Emissions labelling for food and drink products;    Information and skills training for those who manage the land;    Low carbon farming regulations;    Paying farmers and other landowners to use their land to absorb and store carbon;    Amending the procedure for awarding government contracts to give preference to low carbon food producers and carbon storing products;    Changing planning rules so that food can be produced sustainably in a wider range of areas.  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  259  What we eat and how we use the land Assembly members looked at food, farming and land use together because of the impact they have on one another. In total, about a tenth of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions come from farming and others ways we use the land. Land in the UK is mainly used for farming.1 This means it is used for purposes such as growing crops and grazing animals. Only a small amount of land is left natural or used to plant trees. To get to net zero emissions this needs to change. The UK will need to reduce the amount of land used for food production, while still producing enough food. It will need to use more land to help remove carbon dioxide from the air (see chapter nine) or grow crops to burn for energy (this is called bioenergy – please see chapter eight). This will affect what we can eat. What we eat also affects greenhouse gas emissions in other ways. How much we eat and waste, how food is produced, and how far it is transported, can all have an impact on emissions.  What did the assembly consider? Thirty-five assembly members considered the topic of what we eat and how we use the land. We selected these assembly members from the assembly as a whole using random stratified sampling. This ensured that they remained reflective of the wider UK population in terms of both demographics2 and their level of concern about climate change.  1 2  74% of land in the UK is used for agriculture (26% for cropland, 31% for grassland, 17% for rough grazing) – Committee on Climate Change (2018), Land use: Reducing emissions and preparing for climate change. Age, gender, ethnicity, educational qualification, where in the UK they live and whether they live in an urban or rural area.  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  260  These assembly members heard a wide range of views on the future of food, farming and land use for the UK, and how we might move towards that future. They had the opportunity to question each speaker3 in detail. These evidence sessions took place at weekend two of the assembly. Assembly members spent weekend three of the assembly discussing the evidence they had heard and their own views in-depth, before reaching conclusions on three separate areas: A.  Considerations: the overarching considerations that government and Parliament should bear in mind when making decisions about food, farming and land use and the path to net zero;  B.  Futures: what the future of food, farming and land use should look like;  C.  Policy options: how the UK should move toward this future.  Assembly members also had the opportunity to discuss and add anything else they wanted to say to government and Parliament about food, farming, land use and the path to net zero. Assembly members’ views on the implications of Covid-19 for this topic are touched on in Chapter 10.  Contents of this chapter A. Considerations  page 262  B.

All speakers’ presentations are available as slides, videos and transcripts at climateassembly.uk/resources/. An ‘informant’ is a speaker who we asked to cover the range of views and available evidence on a topic. An ‘advocate’ is a speaker who we asked to give their own view, or the view of their organisation. Assembly members knew whether speakers were informants or advocates.  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  261  A. Considerations Assembly members reached their first decisions on food, farming and land use by discussing their answers to the following question: What considerations should government and Parliament bear in mind when making decisions about food, farming and land use and the path to net zero? Assembly members thought about their answers to this question individually. They then discussed their views in small groups at their tables, with each table agreeing their five top considerations. These top considerations had to, between them, represent the range of views at the table. Facilitators took the top considerations from each table and grouped similar options together to create a list on which assembly members could vote. They checked this list back with assembly members to make sure they had accurately reflected their views. This included making any necessary adjustments. Each assembly member could vote for the four options that they felt to be most important. The results were as follows. The wording of the considerations in the table is either word for word what assembly members wrote on their option cards or, where facilitators combined similar options from several tables, how they described the options to assembly members prior to the vote.  % assembly members who chose it as a priority  Rank  Consideration  1  Provide support to farmers – including financial and professional/skills focussed support. Some assembly members noted that any schemes needed to “consider the respective impacts of arable and livestock farming.”  89  2  Information and education – from an early age about “greener and healthier eating habits”. This category also included suggestions for “carbon footprint labelling”.  86  3  Use land efficiently – including:  66  • •  4  “Use the land differently to absorb more carbon” (e.g. “planting forests not trees”, restoring peatlands); “Increased support for and collaboration between farming, forestry, land management and land owners to balance the need for sustainable food production with biodiversity and reduction of harmful emissions”, and other considerations such as flood prevention.  Rules for large retailers / supermarkets – including:  • •  46  Addressing pricing structures and the low prices imposed on farmers; Reducing food waste and packaging.  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  262  5  More local and seasonal food – including:  • • • • 6  Active promotion, encouragement and support of local, seasonal and home-grown food options, including allotments; Support for people on low incomes to be able to access and cook/use healthy local foods; The UK becoming more self-sufficient; Cheaper, local food.  Make low carbon food affordable – including:  •  40  34  “Mak[ing] low carbon, healthy and home cooked food affordable (and vice versa)”. Some assembly members suggested “meat and dairy subsidies [should be put] towards making vegetarian and vegan alternatives more affordable”  7  Some, just less, meat  29  8  Part of planning policy and new developments, including allotments  14  B. Futures After deciding their most important considerations, assembly members moved on to look at the future of food, farming and land use for the UK. To aid them in this process, the Expert Leads presented assembly members with three scenarios for possible futures:   Smarter farming;    Eating differently;    Local food and rewilding.  Together these scenarios cover a broad range of views about what could happen to food, farming and land use to help the UK meet its 2050 net zero target. Assembly members discussed each of the scenarios or ‘possible futures’ in turn, before voting on them by secret ballot. We start by presenting the rationale for their views, taking each possible future in turn.  Jump to the vote results on page 274  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  263  B.1 Smarter farming This scenario would involve making farming more efficient and using more land to store carbon. It would feature changes for businesses but not individuals. What business would do:   Farms would emit less greenhouse gases – e.g. by using more renewables and different animal feeds;    Farming would be more efficient – e.g. by using precision farming, ‘gene editing’ or breeding to select stronger livestock/crops;    Farmers would use more land to store carbon – e.g. planting trees and/or planting energy crops with carbon capture and storage to soak up and store carbon;    Farmers could also use ‘speculative’ measures to store carbon – e.g. using minerals on land to absorb carbon.  What individuals would do:   No change.  Assembly members discussed this possible future at their tables. They identified the following pros and cons.  Pros + Least amount of change, so easier for people to adapt, implement and accept – some assembly members described it as the “soft option”, saying there is “no need for people to change so should be popular.” Others commented that it “will go down best with farmers and the public, because there won’t be any impact on individuals”, that “doesn’t change as much so it is easier for people to accept” or that it would be “easy for people to adapt and easy to implement.” + Moves towards renewables – some assembly members felt it would “encourage farmers to use more renewables” or that it is “positive to move towards renewables.” + Reduces flood risk and provides other benefits – some assembly members noted that it “can reduce flood risk” or that “woodland, hedgerows and peatlands provide other benefits e.g. flood risks.” + More efficient and less waste – some assembly members said that “smarter, more efficient farming practices are beneficial” or that “increased efficiency is really important as it saves money in the long-term, making it more likely to be accepted.” Some liked that it “leads to less waste e.g. less young male cows being slaughtered.” + Protecting farmers, in particular livestock farming – some assembly members suggested that there would be “no job losses (livestock farming)” or that it “ensures [the] farming industry is protected.” Others commented “livestock farming is not at risk” or “livestock farming – no risk to farmers to change the way they work.”  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  264  + Restoring biodiversity and land – some assembly members said that “returning to traditional methods of farming restores (in time) biodiversity and healthy land” or said they liked the idea of “restoring hedgerows – many have been ploughed up so the land can be used (large arable farms).” + ‘Natural’ carbon capture and tree planting – some assembly members felt that “using land to store carbon naturally is a great idea as it restores biodiversity naturally whilst also creating other benefits e.g. food production.” Others liked that “land that is not in use can be used for trees to help capture carbon” or that we could “plan[t] more trees for timber farming.” + “Additives to food to reduce methane” + “20% less land for livestock, more home-grown fruit and veg – small change to diet” + “GM is a great idea, if it’s done properly e.g. government controlled not a big corporation”  Cons − Doesn’t have enough impact on target – some assembly members said they “don’t think it’ll have enough impact on the target” or that it “falls short, doesn’t do enough.” Others said more specifically that “it doesn’t tackle red meat and dairy consumption therefore will carbon emissions be reduced enough?” or “I feel it’s unrealistic to reach net zero if there is no consumer change….” Others agreed suggesting that it “doesn’t change people’s attitudes – some might even decide to increase their intake because they can justify it with smarter farming” or that “it won’t help much if people don’t change their behaviour.” − Unfair on farmers – some assembly members felt that “it seems unfair” or that “all the pressure to change is on the farmers.” − No health improvements – some assembly members commented that there would be “no health improvements” or “no health improvements from dietary change.“ − Negative effects on biodiversity and animal welfare – some assembly members suggested that “some forms of farming intensification could risk biodiversity and animal welfare” or that “increasing efficiency is [a] good idea however we need to be aware of [the] negative effects of some processes, e.g. breeding decreases biodiversity.” Others worried about impacts on “animal welfare” or “reducing welfare standards – selective breeding could have unforeseen [affects], e.g. mad cow disease.” Some said “farming intensification won’t be considered because of biodiversity, animal welfare and carbon capture and storage.” − GM and gene editing issues – some assembly members expressed “gene editing concerns – is it safe?” or asked “do we know the effects of gene editing? If we do and it is fine, then how do we know this?” Others commented “GM – there are already problems with getting rid of ‘weeds’ etc” or “GM crops need to be bought for a fair price as they can’t reproduce, so new seeds need to be bought each year. Also, they reduce biodiversity so will need to be controlled.”  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  265  − Impact on (some) farmers – some assembly members said “farmers’ health and wellbeing is a priority.” Others noted concerns about specific types of farmer: “It could have a big impact on the smallest livestock farmers.” “Would land quality be good enough for many ‘hill farmers’ to plant trees and grow arable crops.” “Restoring hedgerows and woodland – some arable farmers won’t like it as they have removed them for more ‘efficient’ land use.” − “Maintaining ‘look’ of countryside when not in original state” − “Crops from South Africa being shipped in … = carbon footprint” − “Pesticides/chemicals may be used more if there is increased demand” − “Farmland will disappear in order to build homes for an increasing population”  Some assembly noted conditions to their support for this scenario or points they would want taken into account around its implementation. These included suggestions around:     Grants and incentives: —  “Government will have to give grants (e.g. to farmers) to help the transition”;  —  “There have to be incentives in place for farmers to convince them and retrain”;  —  “Can the government support more innovation rather than introduce more regulation?”  Standards, regulations and labelling: —  “Would have to have standards for farming practice to ensure all farming follows these measures”;  —  The “retail industry [would need] to be regulated to ensure fair prices for farmers”;  —  “Any genetically modified crop/livestock need to be labelled to give consumers the opportunity to make an informed choice”;  —  “Should individual farmers be given a quota of livestock to produce but not based entirely on the size of the farm”;  —  As noted above, some assembly members said that GM should be “government controlled.”  Some assembly members also suggested that the “transition can only happen on land that is suitable (e.g. Yorkshire sheep farming won’t be able to convert)” or wondered whether “we [can] look outside of the UK for solutions to land restriction challenges.” When we asked assembly members to rank the possible futures in their order of preference, this scenario received limited support from assembly members. Please see below for the results of the vote.  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  266  B.2 Eating differently This possible future would involve farmers, retailers and individuals taking steps to reduce food waste and choose lower-carbon foods. It would feature changes for businesses and individuals. What business would do:   Farming would be more efficient – e.g. by using precision farming; ‘gene editing’ or breeding to select stronger livestock/crops;    Farmers would use 20% less land for livestock (beef, lamb and dairy) and more for less carbon-intensive crops that grow well in the UK (e.g. some vegetables, fruit);    Farmers/landowners would use more land to store carbon – e.g. planting trees, planting energy crops, restoring peatlands;    Retailers and restaurants would reduce food waste – e.g. reducing portion sizes;    There could also be more ‘speculative’ measures to produce food – e.g. making synthetic (lab-grown) meat or using genetically modified (GM) foods to improve crop yields.  What individuals would do:   Eat lower-carbon foods, including 20% less red meat and dairy    Waste less food – e.g. choosing smaller portions  Assembly members discussed this possible future at their tables. They identified the following pros and cons.  Pros + Changes to land use – some assembly members supported the idea of “reduc[ing] land used for livestock”, saying it could be “reused for other things” or would be “free to grow more fruit and veg domestically instead of importing.” Some noted that changing land use would “reduc[e] carbon emissions (through 20% less land for livestock).” Others suggested that “restoring woodland etc will reduce flood risk and increase biodiversity – restoring peatlands and planting trees is beneficial for the environment.” One assembly member commented that the “landscape is already changing” and that “people complain about [the] look of ‘prairie’ farmland, loss of habitat for wildlife.” + Positive changes to farming – some assembly members noted their support for certain types of farming, suggesting that: + “Seasonal farming (horticulture) would be in better balance with wildlife”; + “High intensity farming such as multi-story agriculture (hydroponics)” would be positive; + “Breeding to select stronger livestock crops” is “natural, farmers already do this”; + “Cattle can be run on forests not just fields. It’s a win-win.”  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  267  + Health benefits – some assembly members liked the “health benefits from eating less red meat and dairy” or that it “does require people to change their eating habits…[which] in turn improves their health.” Some assembly members pointed out that health benefits are possible without stopping eating red meat completely: “Red meat is getting [a] bad press, but our ‘experts’ have stated that no more than 100grams a day is perfectly safe.” Others suggested that “farming output will change i.e. different products will replace existing produce leading to... healthier eating habits.” + Realistic, including dietary change already happening– some assembly members felt this future was “more realistic than other options to be able to reach net zero.” Relatedly, others noted that “dietary changes … in meat consumption are already happening e.g. ‘meat free Mondays’” or said this this future would be “quick [to achieve] because people are already reducing the amount of meat and dairy they eat. Young people are more and more inclined to become vegetarian.” One assembly member wondered whether “school children [should] have no meat products in their school meals.” + Less food waste, saves money – some assembly members suggested that “wasting less food” would be positive. Others agreed saying “less food waste is important and an easy thing to do as people will be saving money – only problem will be …reduc[ing] supply.” Some noted it “saves money from reducing food waste – farmers could save money long-term.” One assembly member noted a scheme in a Chinese restaurant in Camberley, which seeks to charge people for waste when they take too much food from the buffet. + “Moves in the right direction, doing more” + “Might not be to everyone’s taste, but where’s the harm in testing the demand for synthetic meat in the market?” + “Farmers must make money long-term in order to maintain [their] lifestyle... [and] provide us with food.”  Cons − Lab meat and GM foods – some assembly members said they were “not sure of the health implications of lab meat and GM foods” or that there is “not enough information about the impact and risk of measures such as GM food to make informed decisions.” Some said “GM foods and lab grown meat – prefer natural food, not necessarily organic but don’t want modified food” or “synthetic lab meat is not something we can support. Either you eat proper meat, or you don’t.” Some assembly members suggested that “gene editing open[s] the door for science and big businesses to take over.” − Not (sufficiently) effective – some assembly members questioned “does it go far enough? 20% less red meat and dairy may not reduce enough carbon emissions” or that “using 20% less land (for livestock) won’t affect demand for meat.”  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  268  − Impact on farmers and regional implications – some assembly members disliked that there would be “more impact on farmers”, “potential job losses for farmers”, “risk to livestock farming (job loss)” or “farmers having to retrain.” Some also expressed concerns that it “may have regional implications i.e. farmers in some areas more adversely affected than others.” − Impact on nature – some assembly members suggested that “farming intensification risks biodiversity and animal foods” or that “farmers already do this [breeding to select stronger livestock/crops]; they can’t do this faster (naturally) than they are.” − Societal habits and attitudes not changing fast enough – some assembly members felt that “social changes targeting habits will take a long time to implement, possibly generations through fundamental education” or noted that the “social barrier could be a big issue – attitudes are already changing, but will it be fast enough?” − Controlling – relatedly, some assembly members worried that “people might feel forced if they’re not educated about the goals of meat reduction.” Others said it “might be rather restrictive and controlling.” − Restaurant implications – some assembly members disliked the “restaurant restrictions” saying it’s “hard enough to make a living and restaurants already try to reduce food waste.” − Concerns about cost – some assembly members suggested that “the less meat there is available the more expensive it’ll be…[which] will specifically affect poorer people and families.” Others questioned “who will be footing the bill?”, asking “will the government subsidise, or will it be down to us?”  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  269  − “Not realistic” − “Risk to animal welfare is not okay!” − “Will reduce the amount of our fresh milk supply, which is our most bought dairy milk item”  Some assembly members noted conditions to their support for this possible future, or points they would want taken into account if it is implemented:   “Government will need to provide farmers with subsidies” or that they supported this possible future “as long as farmers are supported in the transition to move away from livestock.”    More public information and education is needed “on less meat and non-meat diets” and “about GM foods for [the] public to make informed decisions”;    “The change in consumer mindsets will only occur if incentivised and not forced”;    Retailers and fast food restaurants need to change too – “don’t just push waste onto the consumer, no wasteful production.”  One assembly member commented that they would want to see more technological change added to this possible future to reduce carbon emissions further. When we asked assembly members to rank the possible futures in their order of preference, this scenario received considerable support from assembly members.  B.3 Local food and rewilding This possible future would involve fundamental change in food systems and landscapes, towards local production and more space for biodiversity. It would feature changes for businesses and individuals. What business would do:   Food would be produced locally in towns, as well as the countryside, including growing food indoors, in gardens, in allotments, as well as on farms;    More wholefoods and less processed foods would be available and more food would be bought directly from producers – e.g. farmers markets, veg boxes, food co-operatives – than from supermarkets;    Farming would be more efficient – e.g. by using precision farming; ‘gene editing’ or breeding to select stronger livestock/crops;    Farmers would use at least 40% less land for livestock (beef, lamb and dairy) and more for less carbon-intensive crops that grow well in the UK (e.g. some vegetables, fruit);    Farmers/landowners would use more land to store carbon – e.g. planting trees, planting ‘energy crops’, restoring peatlands;  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  270    Retailers and restaurants would reduce food waste – e.g. reducing portion sizes;    There could also be more ‘speculative’ measures to produce food – e.g. making synthetic (lab-grown) meat or using genetically modified (GM) foods (to improve crop yields).  What individuals would do:   Eat lower-carbon foods, including 40%+ less red meat and dairy, and less processed foods;    Waste less food, e.g. choosing smaller portions.  Assembly members discussed this possible future at their tables. Assembly members tended to be consistent in what they saw as the main pros of this option, with strong support for the idea of local produce and food production. Assembly members were more divided about the cons, with smaller numbers of assembly members picking up a number of different points.  Pros + Support for local produce – some assembly members said they “love the idea of local (food) and less use of supermarkets”, “great idea for local produce” or that they liked that this future “encourages people to buy local and locally produced products.” Others suggested that this future was “overall [a] good option, just [with] a few extreme aspects – having more food locally is good.” Some were specific about why they like the idea of local produce, suggesting that “having more local foods will reduce costs and the food will be fresh” or that there is a “feel good factor with ‘grow your own’ or getting food locally produced e.g. eggs.” Others said “wastage – need more local markets to sell local produce”, “could be cheaper for people and less packaging” or suggested local food is a “money saving incentive for local and personal food waste reduction – make it visible.” + Benefits of local produce for farmers – some assembly members suggested that “farmers [would] get a better price for food”, with others commenting that people “don’t mind paying a bit more, if you know where it’s from and if it’s going to a local vegetable grower.” + Community benefits from local food production – some assembly members suggested that there would be “community benefits from local food production and co-operative food schemes” or “community and wellbeing benefits from community/individual growing.” Some liked that “communities’ access to local food is increased.” + Getting people more involved and aware – some assembly members felt it “educates and involves people in the process of meat reduction and growing local production” or that “improved self-sustainability makes individuals aware of the plant to plate process, reduces waste and improves awareness.” Some commented “communal gardening – inner cities? Grow veg, free to pick – makes people more aware and engaged with source of food nutrition and benefits.” Others suggested that it “encourages everyone, not just farmers to grow using different methods.” + Restoring woodlands, hedgerows, peatlands and gorselands – some assembly members said this would provide benefits including reducing flood risk, acting as a carbon store, supporting biodiversity and encouraging more wildlife.  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  271  + Health benefits – some assembly members highlighted the “health benefits from eating less red meat, dairy and processed foods” or said it “encourages people to cook their own meals – better for health and diet.” + Impact on carbon reduction – some assembly members liked that this future included a “more dramatic reduction in high carbon food”, with others suggesting it would have the “largest impact on reducing carbon emissions.” Relatedly, some noted that it “make[s] more land available for less carbon intensive crops (more is better)”, or that “less import is great as the production within our country will be more green and transport costs will be lower as well.” + “Promotes change for everyone in the food chain – good because everyone needs to change.” + “Hydroponics method releases some land for other use and can only be grown in small amounts – less transport needed.”  Cons − Jobs and regional impact – some assembly members expressed concern about “job losses – farming.” Others commented: “impact on the regions where beef and lamb are bred, could have long-term consequences … [for the] local economy. Small farmers will be forced out of farming. Rich will get richer; the big will get bigger.” − Impact on low income households – some assembly members suggested that “large numbers of families rely on cheaper food prices in supermarkets etc, due to their low income/financial situations.” Others commented “cost – less meat and dairy will mean poorer people/families will be hardest hit” or said it was a “risk to equality and less fair for those on low incomes.” − GM food/farming – some assembly members said “again, includes modified ‘farming’” or “GM – again do not like modified food.” Others said we “need to know more about gene editing then [be] given a choice.” − Nutritional and safety issues – some assembly members said they were “not sure about the nutritional level on vertical wall farming foods” or highlighted ”possible food safety risk[s] with more informal schemes.” − Scale of behaviour change and controlling people – some assembly members felt that a 40% reduction in meat and dairy is “too much.” Others suggested that “convincing individuals to make the change may be a problem” or that “for that kind of fundamental change, 30 years is not long enough – behaviours cannot change so radically/quickly.” One assembly member noted that they didn’t “like the idea of controlling people to change food choices.” Some said “role of supermarkets: so big, it will be hard to go back to local shops. Big part of people’s life. Will be hard to persuade people to change.”  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  272  − Need for education – some assembly members suggested that “many young people don’t know how to cook healthy nutritional foods from scratch, would have to work with education” or said “food choices – if we need to change, more options [need] to be available. *Education*” − Animal welfare – some assembly members said that the “risk to animal welfare is not okay!” − “Potential risk to rare breeds” − “This idea is to move food production back to towns and cities, but we already produce too much food, and will this actually reduce food production” − “Difficult for people in dense, urban areas to get access to ‘grow your own’ options (highest population)”  Some assembly members noted conditions to their support for this possible future, or points they would want taken into account if it is implemented:   It “could be a positive change, as long as training subsidies are provided to ex-meat/ dairy farmers”;    “Imported food [needs to be]… regulated somehow. We don’t just want to increase our importing of Brazilian beef with a higher carbon footprint”;    “Mindsets need to change”;    Attention needs to be paid to ensuring we “don’t price people out completely”;    “Retailers/restaurants need to buy fresh not frozen food, this would reduce food waste. Use by dates differ. Local purchase if possible.”    “Local food: local councils need to look at that. Communities and local producers in green belts need to produce local food.”    A number of assembly members emphasised the importance of allotments, with some recommending that allotments should added “into housing developments”. One assembly member said:  next to the second biggest [allotment] in the country. The local authority can’t use “ itI live as a shop to sell surplus [food grown]. It has to be used by local authorities – needs to be looked at; it is a massive missed opportunity.” When we asked assembly members to rank the possible futures in their order of preference, this scenario received considerable support from assembly members.  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  273  Cross-cutting comments A small number of assembly members made cross-cutting comments about the possible futures. Some highlighted the “differences in farming in rural areas vs urban areas – very different problems and solutions required.” Others noted again the need to consider the impact and suitability of different land uses, such as forestry, for different parts of the country and types of land. Some assembly members suggested that all three possible futures “need to be combined when developing policy” or that the “scenarios include lots of proposals but only some of them are agreed with.” These two points are picked up in more detail in the next two sections. Some assembly member re-emphasised their concern about GM and lab grown food, noting the “risks” of these types of food and the fact they had “triggered lots of concerns” at the assembly. Some also highlighted that these foods “could be received with lots of opposition” by the wider public. Conversely a smaller number of assembly members felt that the assembly did not hear enough information about genetically modified food and expressed concerns that “our response was therefore based on preconceptions not evidence.”  Vote results Assembly members voted on the possible futures by secret ballot. The ballot paper asked them to rank the possible futures in their order of preference. The votes were counted in two ways:   Counting assembly members’ first preference votes only. This tells us what assembly members would and wouldn’t choose if they could have their most preferred future.    Using Borda count. This involves allocating points for preferences – a first preference vote scored two points, a second preference vote one point and a third preference no points. Counting the votes like this tells us which futures are most acceptable to the greatest number of assembly members.  Figure 1: Possible futures  Please rank the possible futures in order of preference (% 1st preference votes)  % 40  35% 20  38%  26%  0 Smarter farming  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  Eating differently  Local food and rewilding  274  Figure 2: Possible futures  Please rank the possible futures in order of preference (Borda count)  50  40  41  38  30  20  25  10 0 Smarter farming  Eating differently  Local food and rewilding  The results of the votes consistently show greatest support amongst assembly members for ‘eating differently’ and ‘local food and rewilding’. ‘Local food and rewilding’ received slightly more first preference votes. ‘Eating differently’ scored slightly better in the Borda count. In both votes the difference is minimal. Assembly members who chose ‘local food and rewilding’ as their first preference wrote positive reasons for their choices on their ballot papers, focussing on why they liked this future. Their explanations always mentioned a range of reasons, not just one. Points that came up frequently included those around:   Health benefits;    Community and wellbeing benefits from local food and local food production;    Advantages for farmers including fairer prices and reducing supermarkets’ “stranglehold”. One assembly member suggested that “more localised food production would enable farmers to plan and adapt better to local market conditions/requirements.” Another suggested it would benefit local businesses as well as farmers;    Support for a “managed diversity” of land use, including steps such as restoring woodlands, peatlands and gorselands.    Other potential environmental or emissions benefits, such as reductions in packaging and the transporting of foods, or a decrease in food waste;    A general feeling that the future “promote[s] a positive change” for everyone in the food chain, building on some social trends already underway.  Smaller numbers of assembly members suggested that this future would result in better pricing and food quality for consumers, or that it would reduce the likelihood of intensified farming for livestock, thus promoting animal welfare.  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  275  Some assembly members who supported this future noted caveats to their support. These touched on concerns around GM and lab grown foods, animal welfare and the need for changes in land use to take account of regional differences: decrease and reuse of land for livestock is a good thing as long as that is practical “ The for that region (some areas are no good for anything but sheep).” One assembly member said that they would want the change in meat and diary to be 20% not 40%. Assembly members who chose ‘eating differently’ as their first preference gave a range of reasons for their choice on their ballot papers. Two themes that recurred several times amongst their answers were the ideas of:   Shared responsibility between different actors – for example, some stated “we [would] all take responsibility: individuals, farmers, retailers” or that “we can’t expect one group to take on all the responsibility for everybody”;    Lesser change and smaller negative impacts – for example, some commented that there would be “small changes for farmers, other producers, and for the general public” or “less impact on farmers with regard to possible job losses.”  Several of the rationales talked about this future in relation to the other two. For example: I think all of the options are good but smarter farming wouldn’t be enough on its “ own and I can see issues with the 3rd option that would need to be addressed first, e.g. teaching people how to change their diets and cook healthy, nutritional meals from scratch. Also 40% less livestock land may be too big a jump. [….] So option 2 was my favourite on balance but I do still support the other options and believe we will need to use a combination of all of them over a number of years to eventually work towards the best option (somewhere between 2 and 3).” like any of the scenarios, this is the best of a bad lot. I don’t encourage GM crops “ inI don’t any way, or lab grown meat. However, I do acknowledge the need to change. I worry though that a drop in meat production and dairy will always affect the poorer and families more than the rich….” These last two quotes raise themes noted by a number of assembly members. They are addressed more fully directly below.  Futures – conclusions Assembly members’ discussions on the possible futures presented a nuanced but clear picture of their views on food, farming and land use. A number of assembly members made comments in group discussions and on their ballot papers about either: (1) liking all of the futures and feeling that they needed to be combined; or (2) not liking any of the futures because they disagreed with some elements of each of them. Some assembly members said they “wanted the good bits” of all of them.  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  276  These comments fit with some clear themes emerging from assembly members’ discussions. In general, assembly members tended to express support for:   Local produce and local food production – for a wide range of reasons including community benefits, fairer prices for farmers, a ‘feel good factor’ and reduced environmental impacts (packaging, transport etc);    A change in diet to reduce meat and dairy consumption by between 20% and 40% – overall the assembly tended to stress that significant education was needed to promote voluntary, rather than compulsory, changes in diet. ‘Choice’ was important. They did however tend to support the need for these changes in diet to happen, including noting the health benefits these would bring;    A “managed diversity” of land use, including steps such as restoring woodlands, peatlands and gorselands.  Assembly members noted strongly on several occasions the need for the above to be combined with support for farmers to make the transition. This was also their top consideration (please see Section A above). Areas where some assembly members expressed strong concerns were:   GM and lab grown food – some assembly members voiced strong opposition to including this in any potential future;    Animal welfare – some assembly members expressed strongly that this needed to be protected;  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  277    Impact on lower income families/households – some assembly members advocated strongly for measures to ensure that changes to food, farming and land use (including local food production and the price of meat/dairy) did not disproportionately affect the less well off.  Some assembly members also spoke at various points about the need to ensure that any changes and related measures took account of smaller farms, the suitability of different land for different uses, and differences in impact between UK regions.  C. Policy options After considering the future of food, farming and land use in the UK, assembly members moved on to consider how we might get there. Specifically they looked at policy options in two areas:   Changing farming, food production and land use;    Changing retail and individuals’ behaviour.  For each of these areas, the Expert Leads recapped and explained potential policy options. Assembly members discussed these ideas in their groups before voting by secret ballot. They were also able to note additional suggestions.  C.1 Changing farming, food production and land use Assembly members looked at six options for changing farming, food production and land use:   Low carbon farming regulations;    Payments for carbon storage;    Grants for research and development;    Government contracts for bioenergy and forestry products;    Changing planning rules;    Information and skills training.  We start by presenting the rationale for their views, taking each policy option in turn.  Jump to the vote results on page 288  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  278  Low carbon farming regulations This would involve:   Requirements for farmers to retain a proportion of their land for non-food uses, such as woodland or peatland; or    Making farm payments conditional on low carbon practices (such as using different feeds or fertilisers) and other public benefits (such as protecting biodiversity).  This could involve extending existing rules that make it illegal for farmers to use artificial fertiliser where it is likely to run-off into water sources. Assembly members identified a number of pros and cons about low carbon farming regulations.  Pros + Effective – some assembly members felt it “will be more effective” than the other options, will be “effective in reducing emissions” or is “the only one guaranteed to do something.” Others commented that “regulations = change” or that “farmers need constant reminding and auditing to ensure change happens.” + Co-benefits, particularly from woodland and peatland – some assembly members commented that “increasing woodland and peatland helps with flooding, wildlife and biodiversity” or that the “increase [in] woodland/peatland …will greatly help flood protection.” + Reduces use of fertilisers – some assembly members liked the existing rule that “prohibits farmers from using artificial fertilisers [where it causes pollution]” or the potential “reduction of artificial fertilisers” through more low carbon farming practices. + “Rewards farmer for changing” + “Extending existing rules” + “Promotes [the] restoring of peatland and woodland”  Cons − Dislike regulation – some assembly members said “regulation is a big and unpopular step”, that they “don’t like regulation – nanny state”, or that the policy amounted to “heavy hand[ed] regulation.” Others commented: “No regulations! – low-carbon practices to be encouraged not enforced.” − Cost to farmers and the need for support – some assembly members suggested it would be “more expensive for farmers” or that there would be a “cost for farmers.” Others asked “would there be sufficient support for farmers?” or stated that farmers would “need financial support.” Some said they disliked that the “government would have to subsidise.“ Some queried “incurs cost to farmers – what about [the] long-term?”  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  279  − Who pays? – some assembly members asked “what is the impact of these financial incentives on everyone’s tax?” or suggested that any “price rise could affect low income families.” Some commented that “funding support [would be needed] to reduce [the] impact on public consumption of farmers’ increased costs.” − “Not fair to farmers, not sure there would be a result” − “Obstacle to passing farms down to the next generation” − “Not all farmland can be used for low-carbon practices e.g. sheep farmland”  Some assembly members noted conditions to their support for this policy option, or points they would want taken into account if it was implemented. They suggested a need for:   Nuance, for example to take account of local conditions: some assembly members said what was suitable “would depend on land and geography and [measures would] have to be localised.” Others noted a need to “think of farmers who can’t change land use.”    Financial incentives and support, including careful thought about how they work: some assembly members said they would support the policy if it went “along with financial incentives and support.” Others focussed on how subsidies might work: “Subsidies need to be means tested. At the moment, large rich landowners get as much in subsidies as small farmers who don’t earn or own a lot. It’s not a fair system, single farm payment. Based on Common Agricultural Policy, not a fair system.”    A combined approach: some assembly members said that “all options [for policies to change farming, food production and land use] need to be combined” or specifically that options a, b, d and f4 should be combined, “including steps around information and skills, regulations and payments for carbon storage and government contracts for bioenergy and forestry products.”  Others said their support for the policy would depend on the detail of how it worked, for example: “What percentage of land would farmers be required to keep as that? Which farmers would receive payments?” Others commented that “regulations [would] have to be fair for farmers” or that “although it is more expensive at first, in the long run it is cheaper as it has higher efficiency for farmers.”  Payments for carbon storage This would involve farmers and other landowners earning money for using their land to absorb and store carbon, for example by restoring peatland or planting trees. Payments or incentives could also be provided for food producers who increase productivity or efficiency – in other words, who produce as much or more food using less land. Assembly members identified a number of pros and cons about payments for carbon storage.  4  Options a, b, d and f are: low carbon farming regulations, payments for carbon storage, government contracts for bioenergy and forestry products, and information and skills training.  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  280  Pros + Good for the natural world – some assembly members suggested it would provide “support for [the] natural world” or lead to the “improved health of rivers.” Others said they liked the idea of “free distribution of tree saplings – connected to nature.”5 + Incentivises low carbon practices and is flexible – some assembly members said they “think this will incentivise good practice by farmers and will catch on as other farmers see [the] pay system working.” Others liked that it provides an “incentive for farmers and encourages low-carbon practices in a flexible way.” + Effective at storing carbon – some assembly members noted that “even at low uptake rates or slow change, [the] impact on reducing carbon is positive” or labelled it “quite a good approach, good for storing carbon.” Others said we “need to do it.”  Cons − Who pays what? – some assembly members asked “what is the impact of these financial incentives on everyone’s tax?” or “how much do we pay farmers and landowners?” Others queried “how long do payments go on for?” or “who would pay for this?” − Can all farmers do this? – some assembly members noted “cost to farmers – which farmers can afford [it]?” or expressed concerns that it “may just make the richer owners richer and not [be] possible for small landowners.” Others suggested that “some farmers can’t change their practices because the land is only suitable for e.g. sheep.” − Won’t create (enough) change – some assembly members felt it would lead to “slower change (farmers not required to change)” or suggested that “farmers must be forced to change attitude towards [the] carbon storage goal for it to become the norm.” Others commented it “happens anyway, but is not a priority [for farmers]” or that “farmers need to change but need guaranteed financial support.” − “Allow and encourage the farming community to provide the solutions and lead! Based on low-carbon specifications”  Some assembly members noted conditions to their support for this policy option, or points they would want taken into account if it was implemented:   5  Some suggested it “needs to be combined with other things to be effective e.g. low carbon farming regulations and changing planning rules”, or that “all options need to be combined.” Others said “if [the payments are] not carried out in combination [with other options], they probably will have limited impact in terms of changing behaviour and making a difference in reduction of emissions.”  We think this is a reference to this scheme – http://www.onetreeperchild.com – which was brought up by an assembly member.  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  281    Others focused on the finances suggesting that “if government doesn’t pay it [would] pa[y] for itself” or recommending that policy-makers “shift money from bad practice subsidies rather than use extra money.” Some commented “if farmers are receiving payments e.g. subsidies, why aren’t they obliged to use land in diversified ways… e.g. maintaining peatland.” Some suggested that “carbon storage [should]… be encouraged and monitored before payments [are made]” and that there should be “payment scales” linked to the volume of carbon stored. Others queried “what timescale? – for forever?”    Some assembly members commented on the need to consider all types of farmers, saying “think of farmers who can’t change land use” or querying “tenant farmers?” Others said “payments for carbon storage should be proportionate to [the] size of land owned e.g. to make it fair.”    Others expressed support for carbon capture and storage, saying it “seems like a great idea, quick fix but also effective”6 or that “natural carbon storage has other benefits as well e.g. increased biodiversity.” Some assembly members advocated methane capture and storage suggesting it “pays for itself in the long-term, burning it for energy” or commenting that it “should be implemented especially as methane has a larger effect than CO2.”  Some assembly members suggested “use the land that can’t be used for arable.”  Grants for research and development This would involve grants for food producers to support research and technology development. The research and development could focus on making agricultural practices more sustainable, and/or on reducing the costs of meat and dairy made in labs. There could also be a dedicated fund providing loans to help food and farming businesses shift to lower-carbon practices. Assembly members identified a number of pros and cons about grants for research and development  Pros + Encourages innovation – some assembly members said it “encourages innovation” or “encourages farmers/producers to come up with new ideas for reducing emissions.” Others said it would allow us to “innovate [our way] out of [the] problem (not enforce).” + Benefits of R&D, including globally – some assembly members suggested that “research and development have multiple benefits: increased efficiency which is better for the environment; selling this tech worldwide as leaders has further environmental and economic benefits.” Other agreed saying they felt that by innovating the UK could create an opportunity for “global leadership.”  6  The assembly went on to consider carbon capture and storage in detail. Please see chapter nine.  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  282  + It will/could help – some assembly members said they were “confident that it will help” or that it would be beneficial because “there are still problems e.g. flooding, that we … don’t know how to solve yet.” Others were more cautious suggesting it “could be good, but would need to be overs[een] and evaluated.” + “Good for farmers to be the leaders” + “Farmers must engage with changes required – education on benefits and profits over time”  Cons − Not guaranteed to be effective – some assembly members said it was “not guaranteed to be effective” or “might not be as effective as other options.” Others commented that “we must have guarantees that change will happen with funding, otherwise it’s money wasted.” − Will this be funded by taxes? – some assembly members asked “what is the impact of these financial incentives on everyone’s tax?” or noted that there is “lots of talk around grants across topics, but – will this come from taxes? Who will fund it?” Others queried “how much do we pay farmers and landowners?” − Lab food – some assembly members suggested that “lab grown meat diverts attention away from lower carbon options e.g. veganism” or commented “lab food – don’t need it.” Another assembly member commented that “I don’t like the idea of meat and dairy being made in labs – don’t know the impact. Taking jobs from farmers.” − “Risk of bias from funders/sponsors”  A small number of assembly members noted conditions to their support for this policy option, or points they would want taken into account if it was implemented. Some suggested that “impact evaluation [would be] needed to ensure that pilot schemes are actually making a real difference.” Others said that “all [policy] options need to be combined” or suggested linking grants for research and development with low carbon farming regulations.  Government contracts for bioenergy and forestry products This would involve amending the procedure for awarding government contracts to give preference to carbon-storing products. It would mean government contracts around energy or construction giving preference to bioenergy crops and forestry products (like wood for buildings or furniture). It could also include setting minimum purchase levels – guaranteeing that government will buy a certain amount of these products per year. Providing a long-term customer base for bioenergy crops and timber would give farmers certainty that they can make money from them. Assembly members identified a number of pros and cons about government contracts for bioenergy and forestry products.  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  283  Pros + “Allows farmers to use land they weren’t otherwise using to plant bioenergy crops” + “Government sets precedent, gives carbon-friendly industry a foot up” + “Supports campaigns who have interest[s] besides profit” + “Really easy option, makes sense” + “Government contracts good for competition, competition is healthy and produces better goods”  Cons − Unsure about bioenergy crops – some assembly members said they “don’t want to include bioenergy” or that “bioenergy is not the way to go as it requires a lot of land and releases CO2.” Others queried “are bioenergy crops any more carbon efficient if we are still burning them?”7 − Puts burden on farmers – some assembly members disliked that that “farmers must change to achieve lower emissions.” Others suggested that this policy “puts indirect pressure on farmers” or asked “will some farmers need retraining?” Some assembly members countered this final point saying “we always need to learn new things – so it [farmers needing to be retrained] is not a problem.” − “How long will it take?”  7  The assembly went on to look at bioenergy in detail (please see chapter eight).  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  284  Some assembly members noted conditions to their support for this policy option, or points they would want taken into account if it was implemented. Some suggested the policy should be expanded in scope: shouldn’t be limited to the farming industry – how about building industry using “ These low carbon materials.” lot of contracts with farmers are from the private sector (e.g. supermarkets, restaurants). “ ANeed to think more widely with procurement contracts, not just government.” Others queried “will new governments honour previous contracts for bioenergy etc?” As with previous policy options, some assembly members noted their preference for “all options need to be combined” or for those responsible to “think of farmers who can’t change land use.”  Changing planning rules This would involve changing planning rules so that healthy food can be produced sustainably in a wider range of areas, including in urban areas and buildings. This could include requiring new developments to set aside space for residents or communities to grow their own food. The changes could also make it easier to locate renewables, such as wind turbines or solar panels, on farmland or elsewhere. Assembly members identified a number of pros and cons about changing planning rules.  Pros + Space, scope, feasibility – some assembly members commented “rooftop developments and vertical green walls – lots of scope for this” or noted that there are “lots of empty buildings already.” Others suggested “turning existing green spaces/squares into allotments e.g. plot in the middle of high rise [buildings]” or said “smaller allotments are needed e.g. long waiting lists in some cities, urban areas particularly.” + Less packaging and transportation – some assembly members liked that it involved a “reduction of food miles” or that it involved “less packaging and [less] nee[d] [for] low carbon transport from rural to urban.” + Fewer imports and local – some assembly members commented “less import[s] and more self-sustainable.” Others liked that it’s a “local way of doing [things] – not shipping food” or said that “growing locally means you know what has gone into it.” + General support – some assembly members said that they “can’t see a negative with this option” or “like this option very much.” + “Planning guidelines must be monitored to ensure compliance. Leads to better choice of product” + “Buying direct from farmers so profit made, and consumers pay fair price” + “Not too restrictive”  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  285  Cons − Need to ensure standards are met – some assembly members expressed concern about “safety issues and loose standards” or “food standards not being maintained – open to abuse and people not checking.” Some commented that “food standards must be adhered to – ensure health and safety is paramount….” − “Will planners recognise what needs are?” − “No guarantee that people will use them” − “Changes are too big”  Some assembly members noted conditions to their support for this policy option, or points they would want taken into account if it was implemented. They suggested:   We “need to make sure food is the same price or cheaper”;    We should “make [the] most of existing brownfield [sites] in urban areas.”    “Food standards are only a problem if you’re going to sell the produce, but okay if you’re going to consume it.”    “All [policy] options need to be combined.”  Information and skills training This would involve providing information and skills training to those who manage the land in order to encourage low-carbon farming practices and other ways of reducing emissions (e.g. restoring peatlands, planting trees, growing different crops). Assembly members identified a number of pros and cons about information and skills training.  Pros + Understanding why change is needed – some assembly members said “farmers need to understand why they’re being asked/told to change.” Other commented: “education is the basis for everything, especially if the government is going to make changes. With farming practices, [it] will need a lot of education and training.” + Common sense – some assembly members said it was a “no brainer” that should be “available no matter what.” Others said “most [people] want changes.” + “Train and benefit farmers including across generations” + “Primary schools planting food – good for education and attention from media, fast solution?” + “Low cost”  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  286  Strongly disagree  Figure 3 : Changing farming, food production and land use  Disagree  How much do you agree or disagree that each of the following policy options should be part of how the UK gets to net zero?

There were two ballot papers. The first ballot paper asked assembly members how much they agreed or disagreed that each policy option should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. The second ballot paper asked them to rank the options in their order of preference. The votes from this second ballot paper were counted both in terms of first preference votes and via Borda count. Assembly members were in general very supportive of the policy options: a clear majority of assembly members ‘agreed’ or ‘strongly agreed’ that all six policies should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. For five of the six policy options, the percentage of assembly members backing their implementation was over 80%. A comparatively smaller 60% of assembly members supported the remaining option of ‘grants for research and development.’ There was also a difference in how much ‘strong’ support policies received. Assembly members were most likely to ‘strongly agree’ with ‘information and skills training’, ‘changing planning rules’ and ‘low carbon farming regulations’, followed by ‘payments for carbon storage’. In the ranking vote ‘grants for research and development’ remained assembly members’ least preferred option by some distance. The main difference was that information and skills training received less support in terms of first preference votes in particular than might have been expected given the earlier result. This difference may be explained by the fact that, while assembly members generally felt it should happen, they were uncertain about how much change it would create by itself.

We start by presenting the rationale for their views, taking each policy option in turn.  Jump to the vote results on page 298  Bans and restrictions This would involve applying bans or restrictions to the most carbon-emitting food-types (e.g. red meat, processed foods, foods transported by aeroplanes). The rules could start by reducing the use of these foods in the public sector, for example in schools and hospitals. Adverts for high-carbon foods could also be regulated. This could mean forcing adverts to include information about the relevant food’s emissions, or banning the adverts altogether. Other regulations could focus on food retail (restaurants, cafes, takeaways, shops/supermarkets, caterers), perhaps limiting high-carbon foods on menus, or reducing portion sizes. Assembly members identified a number of pros and cons about bans and restrictions.  Pros + Changes in schools and hospitals – one assembly member said “I like the idea of public sector establishments only offering healthy/low carbon food.” Others agreed saying you “don’t need [high carbon food] in schools or hospitals.” Some commented that “restricting red meat in hospitals also benefits health – hypocritical to serve” or that “if you’re going to eat meat eat better meat e.g. especially in schools such as primary schools.” + Lack of impact on individuals – some assembly members said it “forces producers to change their ways – trickles down to us. We don’t have to do anything” or it “doesn’t hit individuals hard financially.” + “Restrictions would be okay” + “Health benefits for children and they are more receptive to changes than older people” + “Smaller portion sizes and reducing the amount of high carbon foods in our diets” + “Advertising high carbon foods to be banned, healthy advertising to be encouraged”  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  290  Cons − Bans are too harsh – some assembly members said that “restrictions [are] okay, but not a ban – likely to damage business (butchers, shops, not just farmers).” Others agreed saying “there should be restrictions not bans” or that they disliked “forcing change through ban.” Some commented that “forcing the public to eat/not eat certain foods is bound to be unpopular (impacts on freedom)” or that they “prefer to give people choices rather than banning – some people rely on particular foods, or won’t change and [it] could lead to hoarding and increased black market use.” − “Hard to regulate adverts online” − “School meal the only decent meal a child might get” − “Use of carbon emitting foods is already being reduced in many hospitals and schools” − “Livestock farming to be reduced with alternatives put in place”  Some assembly members noted conditions to their support for this policy option, or points they would want taken into account if it was implemented. Many were about advertising, with most, but not all, favouring restrictions over bans:  “ Allow advert[s] but [they] must have [a] message about carbon footprint” “ Ads with information about food emissions is a great way to educate people.” “ Restricting high carbon advertising is great as it’ll be very effective” “ [I would like to see] no adverts for high carbon foods.” Some assembly members suggested that “schools and hospitals [will] need to ensure [people are] … still getting enough nutrients.” Others called for “greater scrutiny and regulation of unhealthy ingredients, mainly highly processed ingredients such as sweeteners.” Some said in general that we should “not ban just restrict.”  Taxes and incentives for low carbon foods Additional taxes could be brought in for:   The types of food with the largest emissions (e.g. red meat);    Emissions coming from how food is produced, packaged, stored and transported;    Advertising high-carbon food.  These charges could be targeted at producers, retailers, or consumers. Incentives could help make low carbon food cheaper. They could include subsidies for local food suppliers (e.g. food cooperatives) if they are lower carbon. Additional discounts could be given to people on low incomes.  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  291  Assembly members identified a number of pros and cons about taxes and incentives for low carbon foods.  Pros + Taxes and restrictions – some assembly members felt that “taxes on meat could help shift behaviours.” Others liked “taxes/charges for food producers to encourage emission reductions.” + Making low carbon food (comparatively) more affordable – some assembly members liked that it would “make healthy low carbon food much cheaper than unhealthy high carbon food” or suggested it “makes low carbon food more affordable.” Others said that “vegan/ vegetarian diets can be more expensive so decreasing the price and increasing [that of] high-carbon foods will be effective.” + Not everyone has to be able to afford everything – some assembly members said “it’s okay if not everyone can afford red meat” or it’s the “same as [the] current system, where people can afford different foods.” + Less restrictive – some assembly members said it “doesn’t restrict personal choice as much so more likely to be accepted” or that it’s “more free market: gives options; less controlling; carrot and stick.” + Important / meeting a need – some assembly members felt this policy is “really important” or commented that “we do need more low-carbon food.” + “More beetroot bonds”8 + “Charges for red meat locally is better than Brazil etc”  8  One of the speakers, Sue Pritchard from the RSA, mentioned ‘beetroot bonds.’ They are the idea that: “Every person in the UK would receive a monthly dividend to spend on fresh, healthy produce purchased directly from local farmers and traders. For more information, please see https://www.thersa.org/globalassets/reports/rsa-ffcc-our-future-in-the-land.pdf  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  292  Cons − Impact on consumers, including those on low incomes – some assembly members expressed concerns that “retailers will just pass the cost onto the consumer” or that “costs [will]… be passed on to consumers – only a problem if it extends so the poor can’t afford any food.” Others said it “may just mean poorer people can’t eat it [red meat].” − Behaviour of the wealthy – some assembly members disliked that the “wealthy could continue to buy a lot of high carbon foods.” Others were more circumspect, saying “we can’t tell for sure if wealthy people will continue buying high-carbon foods” or that the “wealthy will continue to buy meat, but that’s okay.” − “Concern supermarkets always win, whatever system is in place”  Some assembly members noted conditions to their support for this policy option, or points they would want taken into account if it was implemented:   Education and information: some assembly members said it has “no major downsides, if you communicate about the carbon footprint of products (e.g. share graph from presentation).” Others advocated a combination of “stop[ing] producing high carbon foods and education and awareness of healthier options.”    Supporting people on low incomes – some assembly members stressed the need to provide “support for those on low incomes or nearly low incomes – so it’s fair and doesn’t increase inequality” or to “ensure access for low income individuals.”    Some said they “prefer incentives to taxes.”  One assembly commented that “I like the idea that adverts for high carbon foods could be targeted for regulation/banning altogether.”  Taxes and incentives for reducing food waste Taxes or incentives could:   Encourage shops to reduce waste (e.g. make ‘wonky veg’ cheaper to buy);    Penalise food waste by businesses and individuals (e.g. food waste charges/taxes);    Encourage supermarkets, restaurants and shops to serve smaller portion sizes.  Assembly members identified a number of pros and cons about taxes and incentives for reducing food waste.  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  293  Pros + Reducing food waste – some assembly members said “we produce too much [food] at the moment” or that it would result in “less waste for farmers e.g. wonky veg.” Others liked the idea of “educat[ing] people to only buy what they need – reduces waste.” + Changes for supermarkets and restaurants – some assembly members particularly liked the idea of “supermarkets … sell[ing] smaller packaging/portions” or said it “makes more sense for supermarkets and restaurants – hard to monitor at individual level (e.g. private households).” + Already starting to happen and it works – some assembly members said it’s “already happening, does work” or that “Fareshare9 cafés [are] growing in popularity (social enterprise).” + “Recycle/compost food waste through doorstep collection” + “Not difficult” + “New homes built or developed should have built in waste reduction technology” + “Eco-tax – could use tax revenue for other projects to get to net zero”  Cons − Food going to landfill – some assembly members worried that “charges for food waste could mean people put it in black bins for landfill, causing more greenhouse gas emissions.” Others agreed saying “if you tax food waste, they will chuck it away [in the general waste]” or “concerns about landfill – food needs to be composted nationally as well as wasting less.” − Scepticism – some assembly members queried “do we really need to encourage shops to sell wonky food cheaper?” or “isn’t this a business idea that has been explored already?” Others said “smaller portions – will this have the effect of reducing consumption, or will people just buy more?” or “the wealthy would continue wasting food.” − Penalising people – some assembly members suggested it “penalises businesses and individuals – it’s unfair and unrealistic” or said “don’t penalise people e.g. no council facilities.” − Practical issues – some assembly members noted that it’s “currently very restrictive to share ‘waste’ food so it doesn’t go to waste” or said there would be “some difficult things to manage e.g. if you don’t eat all your food in a restaurant who pays?” − “Let market work” − “Like BOGOF10 deals e.g. freeze/store food”  9 10  For more information about FareShare please see https://fareshare.org.uk Buy One Get One Free  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  294  Some assembly members noted conditions to their support for this policy option, or points they would want taken into account if it was implemented. These tended to fall into two themes. Some assembly members highlighted that “provision would have to be there for food waste” or commented “what other alternative is there for disposal of black bin bags of waste food.” Others suggested there “needs to be national solutions, e.g. composting that already exists locally.” Approaching the issue from a different angle, some assembly members identified a “need to review best before policies, currently causing waste – use same policy as France, if waste food is left at the end of the day, give it to the homeless.” Others suggested a need to get firms to “reduce 2 for 1 deals.” Slightly overlapping with the above, another set of comments looked at who should and shouldn’t take responsibility and pay for any changes:  “ Consider impact of penalising small business e.g. café owners” “ Supermarkets need to take responsibility” “ Incentives only, not taxes as it comes back to the individual” Mostly focus on firms as this will reduce their waste and reduce 2 for 1 deals which “ will lead to decreased consumer waste as well.” Government contracts for low carbon food This would involve amending the procedure for awarding government contracts to give preference to food producers that are low carbon. Food producers are people or companies that make, process and supply food (e.g. farmers, food factories, caterers). It could also involve all public sector catering (e.g. hospital cafes, school canteens) offering plant-based alternatives at every meal. Assembly members identified a number of pros and cons about government contracts for low carbon food.  Pros + Government can lead the way – some assembly members liked “government/public sector contracts for low carbon foods – lead the change”, with others agreeing that they liked the idea of government “leading by example.” + Practical to implement – some assembly members suggested it is a “quick fix, very easy for government to implement” or noted that they are “already regimenting what’s happening e.g. plant-based option in school and in hospital.” Others suggested that it could later be “extend[ed].” + Maintains choice – some assembly members liked that it “maintains choice” or the idea of “offering plant-based alternatives at meals in public establishments.” Others commented that they supported a “Government preference to food produce in low carbon products, but don’t take people’s freedom of choice away on i.e. red meat eaters.”  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  295  + Good for business – some assembly members suggested it “would give [a] huge initial boost to [the] plant-based industry” or that it would “hel[p] companies work out how they might change – test beds.” + “Makes sure child in school gets good school meal” + “Health benefits (more plant-based)” + “Can’t see major downside – needs to be enforced at local government and central government levels and related services (e.g. NHS)”  Cons − Leave it to the experts – some assembly members said that “experts, not civil servants in isolation [should]... develop solutions and track progress/outcomes.” Others said “leave experts to decide not politicians or civil servants.” − “Already happening, so superfluous” − “Doesn’t incentivise producers … regulation would be more effective”  Some assembly members commented that “contracts should include reducing food waste as well.”  Labelling and information This would involve labelling on food and drink products showing the amount of emissions that come from different foods. This could help individuals choose what they wanted to buy. Education could also raise awareness of issues around food and food waste. This could include teaching skills like cooking and meal planning in schools. Assembly members identified a number of pros and cons about labelling and information.  Pros + Educate people and let them choose – some assembly members said it “doesn’t restrict choices but educates people”, that it’s “not controlling, allowing choice” or that it “helps consumer choice.” Others commented that “showing carbon footprint on food helps individuals to choose (reduces confusion on low carbon food)” or that “many people don’t understand climate change – need informing to make the right choice.” + Impactful – some assembly members said you “see [labelling] instantly” and “it would have a big effect.” Others said that “labelling and marketing are very important to change people’s behaviour and what they eat.” Some commented “start young, drives behaviour change.”  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  296  Cons − “Might not work in isolation” − “Name[s] and shame[s] decent producers where a high carbon product has no alternative”  A significant number of assembly members noted conditions to their support for this policy option, or points they would want taken into account if it was implemented. Some talked about how to make labelling effective. Assembly members consistently emphasised that it “must be clear” and “has to be easy to understand.” Some said a “traffic light system [is] needed and [should be] highly visible – simple fuel gauge traffic light labelling.” Others recommended a similar idea, suggesting “labelling on food and drink to show emissions i.e. green sticker for green products. It’s a way of educating people and being transparent.” Others noted that labelling “has to be available when doing online shopping as well.” Others suggested a need for “independent oversight to make sure information is true and properly represents carbon footprint.” Some commented “what about imports? – if you have a choice with one carbon scoring labelled, and the other without, you will probably get the product with the carbon scoring.” Another group of comments focussed on the power of peer influence. Some assembly members said “information and peer pressure on choice of food is as effective as wealth. Need more notice taken of peer pressure to change behaviour.” Others said they “believe in the power of peer influence” or that we “need key influencers for all sorts of audiences, not just young people influencers.” Some assembly members said that “teaching could also cover [the] big picture – life skills, cooking.”  Additional ideas Some assembly members suggested additional policy ideas that could help to change retail and individuals’ behaviour:  “ New policy idea: a carbon card to reward low-carbon lifestyles” Include rules about where products can be placed in supermarkets to encourage “ low carbon choices” “ Can someone invent/distribute recyclable carrier bags” “ High carbon/low carbon menu” “ High/low carbon information on menu” “ Have a small, medium and large portion size serving at restaurants”  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  297  Vote results Assembly members voted by secret ballot on policy options for changing retail and individuals’ behaviours. There were two ballot papers. The first ballot paper asked assembly members how much they agreed or disagreed that each policy option should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. The second ballot paper asked them to rank the options in their order of preference. The votes from this second ballot paper were counted both in terms of first preference votes and via Borda count.

The size of the majorities was however lower in general than for policies to change farming, food production and land use. The exception was ‘labelling and information’ which was more popular than all the policies for changing farming, food production and land use. 77% of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ that it should be introduced, with a total of 94% ‘strongly agreeing’ or ‘agreeing’. The most controversial policy was ‘bans and restrictions’. A small majority (54%) of assembly members supported this option, while 34% ‘strongly disagreed’ or ‘disagreed’ that it should be introduced.  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  298  For the other options, 77% of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ with ‘government contracts for low carbon food’, 72% with ‘taxes and incentives for reducing food waste’ and 66% with ‘taxes and incentives for low carbon foods.’  Figure 7: Changing retail and individuals’ behaviour  How much do you agree or disagree that each of the following policy options should be part of how the UK gets to net zero?

Bans and restrictions secured a reasonable number of first preference votes, but was again the least popular option in the Borda count.  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  300  Policy options – conclusions Assembly members showed strong support for a wide range of policies. Their support was particularly pronounced for policies to change farming, food production and land use:   A clear majority of assembly members ‘agreed’ or ‘strongly agreed’ that all six policies in this category should be part of how the UK gets to net zero;    For five of the six policy options, the percentage of assembly members backing their implementation was over 80%. Assembly members’ preferred options were ‘information and skills training’ (91% supported implementation), ‘changing planning rules’ (83%), ‘low carbon farming regulations’ (89%), and ‘payments for carbon storage’ (87%).  Assembly members noted positives about the policies including effectiveness, feasibility, and co-benefits such as helping nature. They suggested ‘information and skills training’ was a “no brainer” and should be “available no matter what.” They showed comparatively less support for ‘grants for research and development’ (60%). There was also strong support, albeit slightly more measured, for policies to change retail and individuals’ behaviour:   A majority of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that all of the policies should be part of how the UK gets to net zero;    The size of the majorities whilst lower in general was still substantial tending to lie between 60% and 80%.  Assembly members’ preferred policy option in this category was ‘labelling and information’ (94% supported implementation). Assembly members suggested that steps in this area would allow individuals to make an informed choice, with some clearly feeling that this would have a “big effect.” Assembly members put forward a range of ideas about how to implement this policy effectively. Beyond ‘labelling and information’, assembly members also showed substantial levels of support for ‘government contracts for low carbon food’ (77%), ‘taxes and incentives for reducing food waste’ (72%) and ‘taxes and incentives for low carbon foods’ (66%). They showed comparatively less support for ‘bans and restrictions’ (54%). 34% of assembly members ‘strongly disagreed’ or ‘disagreed’ that these should be implemented. Assembly members also put forward a number of additional ideas for policies that could help to change retail and individuals’ behaviour.  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  301  D. Anything else to tell government and Parliament At the end of weekend three, assembly members had the opportunity to add any final thoughts on food, farming, land use and the path to net zero. A large number of assembly members chose to add additional points. All of the comments came from small group discussions – and were wellsupported by the assembly members in those discussions – unless otherwise stated.  About farming and farmers   “Protecting farmers is essential (particularly small to medium scale)– not big ones.” This group continued: “Protecting farmers/farming community is key. They need to get a fair deal for their crops. Need to involve major companies in the process (e.g. supermarkets).”  Another group also commented that they wanted an “emphasis on supporting farming.”   “Farmers in particular should be leading change in their industry and should be supported financially by the government in the process.”    “Solutions and actions must include and allow farmers diversifying into the leisure industry e.g. holiday homes, recreation, petting farms.”    “Should be regional and fixed solutions that work in different contexts – not ‘one size fits all’”. Two assembly members in another group made a similar point: “It isn’t a case of one size fits all – must fit local environment.”    “Prioritise capturing or reducing methane in farming and in tackling food waste (not just focus on carbon).”  About the UK’s relationship with the rest of the world   “Look at what other countries are doing – they may already have solutions that we could use too.”    “Existing climate change laws in UK are restrictive as it’s limited to the UK – more global approach is needed (and R&D), partnership and investment with other countries.”    “Use what we produce or could produce in the UK before we import from abroad.”  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  302  About land use and biodiversity   “Preserve environment and wildlife in whatever changes are made don’t adversely impact it.”    “We shouldn’t build on flood plains – recreate peatland or natural habitat.” (This point was made by three assembly members)    “Rewilding is a popular idea – could help with a lot of problems produced by climate change.” (This point was made by two assembly members)    “Livestock can co-exist with woodland they don’t have to be purely on grassland win-win.” (This point was made by one assembly member)  About education, communication and wider involvement   “Education/information is key.”    “Suggest greater profile given to farmers and farming to educate public on ‘where their food comes from’ etc.”    “Evidence needs to be presented by credible people.”    “All need to be involved, we need media involved. Needs to go beyond the assembly.” Assembly members in this group commented that “as citizens involved in the assembly, we have learned a lot.” One said I “was not bothered so much before the assembly about the evidence”, another that “I heard the evidence and it made me aware of the risks.”  About a fair and managed transition   “Make sure you focus on nearly low income i.e. working poor, just about managing (as well as lowest incomes).”    “Ensure a transition period, no sharp transition.”  About business and waste   “Restaurants should have carbon footprint rating on display (like hygiene rating).”    “League table for brands – competition (for CO2 emissions).”    “Composting food waste nationwide to stop landfill.” (This point was made by four assembly members)  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  303  Conclusions Assembly members put forward eight considerations for government and Parliament to bear in mind when making decisions about food, farming, land use and the path to net zero. These focussed on:   Providing support to farmers;    Information and education;    Using land efficiently;    Rules for large retailers and supermarkets;    More local and seasonal food;    Making low carbon food more affordable;    Some, just less, meat;    Considering net zero as part of planning policy and new developments, including support for allotments.  Assembly members’ preferred future for food, farming and land use in the UK centred around:   Local produce and local food production – for a wide range of reasons including community benefits, fairer prices for farmers, a ‘feel good factor’ and reduced environmental impacts (packaging, transport etc);    A change in diet to reduce meat and dairy consumption by between 20% and 40% – the assembly stressed the significance of education, saying these changes should be voluntary rather than compulsory. They noted the health benefits such changes would bring;    A “managed diversity” of land use, including steps such as restoring woodlands, peatlands and gorselands.  Assembly members noted strongly the need for the above to be combined with support for farmers to make the transition, also saying that changes should take account of smaller farms, the suitability of different land for different uses, and variations in impact between UK regions. They backed measures to make sure changes do not disproportionality affect the less well off, said that animal welfare should not be compromised, and expressed strong concerns about GM and lab grown food. Assembly members showed strong support for policies to change both farming, food production and land use, and retail and individuals’ behaviour. While the former received slightly more support on average, a majority of assembly members ‘agreed’ or ‘strongly agreed’ that all eleven policies they considered should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. In assembly members’ order of preference, these policies were:  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  304  Policy option  Policy objective  % strongly agree or agree  Labelling and information about emissions from food and drink products  Changing retail and individuals’ behaviour  94%  Information and skills training  Changing farming, food production and land use  91%  Low carbon farming regulations  Changing farming, food production and land use  89%  Payments for carbon storage  Changing farming, food production and land use  87%  Government contracts for bioenergy and forestry products  Changing farming, food production and land use  84%  Changing planning rules  Changing farming, food production and land use  83%  Government contracts for low carbon food  Changing retail and individuals’ behaviour  77%  Taxes and incentives for reducing food waste  Changing retail and individuals’ behaviour  72%  Taxes and incentives for low carbon foods  Changing retail and individuals’ behaviour  66%  Grants for research and development  Changing farming, food production and land use  60%  Bans and restrictions  Changing retail and individuals’ behaviour  54%  Assembly members put forward a number of ideas about how to best implement ‘labelling and information’ about emissions from food and drink products. They also suggested a number of additional ideas for policies that could help to change retail and individuals’ behaviour.  Climate Assembly UK ― What we eat and how we use the land  305  7 Ch ap te r  What we buy  Summary of recommendations 1 Assembly members envisaged a future for ‘what we buy’ with five key elements:   Assembly members strongly supported businesses making products using less – and lower carbon – energy and materials. They backed a range of specific policies to further this aim, including ‘resource efficiency targets and standards’ (91%), an ‘amended procedure for awarding government contracts that gives preference to low carbon companies and products’ (83%), taxes on producers, products and services (83%), and ‘extended producer responsibility’ (79%).    Assembly members supported the idea of individuals repairing and sharing more, with less purchasing of new products. They backed ‘measures to enable product sharing’ (77%) including technical and financial support to businesses who offer sharing or renting services.    Assembly members’ felt strongly about the need for better information to promote informed choice and changes in individual behaviour. They supported ‘labelling and information about the carbon emissions caused by different products and services’ (92%) and ‘product labelling and information campaigns about what can be recycled and why it’s important’ (92%). They also backed ‘advertising bans and restrictions’ on high emissions products or sectors (74%).    Assembly members supported a range of measures aimed at increasing recycling, including ‘deposit return schemes’ (86%), ‘increased doorstep  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  recycling’ (85%), and ‘grants and incentives for businesses’ to improve recycling, develop new materials and make goods from recycled materials (77%). Their preferred future included businesses doing more to turn old products into new ones.   Assembly members called for longterm commitment from government and Parliament. They emphasised the importance of cross-party support to prevent policies changing when governments change, as well as the need to look at both quick wins and longterm solutions.  2 Some assembly members raised additional points for government and Parliament to consider around a need to take account of imports, ring-fence any tax revenue generated by the above policies, and protect consumers from increased costs. Some also highlighted trust and compliance issues relating to business, asking for transparency, honesty, strong enforcement, and reliable and independent information and schemes. Assembly members welcomed measures that would create additional job opportunities and stressed the need for a Just Transition. 3 Assembly members were also clear about what they did not support. They did not back voluntary agreements, changes to income tax or working hours, personal carbon allowances, recycling requirements or pay-as-you-throw schemes. Their concerns included that measures would be ineffective or impractical, that they would penalise the less well-off, or that they would have unwanted side-effects such as an increase in fly-tipping.  307  What we buy The things we buy are linked to climate change because they use energy, and some of that energy comes from fossil fuels like oil, coal and gas. They use energy:   While they are being made – for example, to extract raw materials or in factories;    Through services we use when we buy them – for example, we may buy products on the internet. The internet uses energy for tasks like powering the servers that store our data;    Because of how they reach us – making packaging for products and transporting them to us uses energy;    Some products need energy to run – for example, mobile phones, kitchen appliances and cars.  Throwing away products has implications for climate change too. The UK has traditionally sent most of its waste to landfill sites. Some of this waste generates potent greenhouse gases as it rots. Most of the emissions linked to the goods and services we purchase are produced in the UK. Some, however, are produced in other countries. For example, a lot of the electronic products we buy, such as televisions and computers, are made abroad,1 meaning that the factories that make these products release their greenhouse gas emissions overseas. This still causes climate change: the greenhouse gases end up in the atmosphere whichever country they come from. However these overseas emissions are not included in the UK’s net zero target.2  What did the assembly consider? Thirty-five assembly members considered the topic of ‘what we buy’ in-depth. We selected these assembly members from the assembly as a whole using random stratified sampling. This ensured that they remained reflective of the wider UK population in terms of both demographics3 and their level of concern about climate change. 1 2 3  Allwood, J., Azevedo, J., Clare, A., Cleaver, C., et al. (2019). Absolute Zero. https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.46075 We explained this fact to assembly members and provided them with brief information about UK and overseas emissions. Age, gender, ethnicity, educational qualification, where in the UK they live and whether they live in an urban or rural area.  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  308  These assembly members heard a wide range of views on the future of ‘what we buy’ for the UK, and how we might move towards that future. They had the opportunity to question each speaker4 in detail. These evidence sessions took place at weekend two of the assembly. Assembly members spent weekend three of the assembly discussing the evidence they had heard and their own views in-depth, before reaching conclusions on three separate areas: A.  Considerations: the overarching considerations that government and Parliament should bear in mind when making decisions about ‘what we buy’ and the path to net zero;  B.  Futures: what the future of ‘what we buy’ in the UK should look like;  C.  Policy options: how the UK should move toward this future.  Assembly members also had the opportunity to discuss and add anything else they wanted to say to government and Parliament about ‘what we buy’ and the path to net zero. Assembly members’ views on the implications of Covid-19 for this topic are touched on in Chapter 10.  Contents of this chapter A. Considerations  page 310  B.

An ‘informant’ is a speaker who we asked to cover the range of views and available evidence on a topic.  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  309  A. Considerations Assembly members reached their first decisions on ‘what we buy’ by discussing their answers to the following question: What considerations should government and Parliament bear in mind when making decisions about what we buy and the path to net zero? Assembly members thought about their answers to this question individually. They then discussed their views in small groups at their tables, with each table agreeing their five top considerations. These top considerations had to, between them, represent the range of views at the table. Facilitators took these top considerations from each table and grouped similar options together to create a list on which assembly members could vote. They checked this list back with assembly members to make sure they had accurately reflected their views. This included making any necessary adjustments. Each assembly member could then vote for the four options that they felt to be most important. The results were as follows. The wording of the considerations in the table is either word for word what assembly members wrote on their option cards or, where facilitators combined similar options from several tables, how we described the options to assembly members prior to the vote.  Rank  Consideration  % assembly members who chose it as a priority  1  Education and information for consumers – including:  74  • • • 2  Education and awareness to help consumers understand their choices; Labelling of products (e.g. carbon scoring system – red/amber/green)  Long-term commitment from government and Parliament – including:  • • • 3  Good, clear, accessible and understandable information, so people understand what’s going on and the impact of their choices;  Long-term cross-party commitment from Parliament; Long-term commitment from government, with no backsliding; A permanent citizens’ assembly to oversee the work of Government.  Regulate and incentivise companies to produce things that last longer – including:  • • • •  69  60  Incentivise companies to produce things that last longer; Make the cost of producing high emissions products high/prohibitive; Clear labelling of products to provide information (and choice) to consumers; Make items more efficient and easier to repair and incentivise individuals and companies to do so.  4  Benefit research, manufacturing and development in UK  46  5  Place controls and restrictions on advertising of environmentally damaging products, and label them clearly as such  34  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  310  6  Include quick-wins and long-term solutions – including:  • • •  31  Scaling up things that are already working (e.g. charity shops); Doing things that can be done immediately that will have the biggest impact for carbon reduction; Planning and piloting longer term initiatives.  7  Create a culture through education to encourage minimising waste and to help establish community repair, re-use and recycle initiatives (e.g. better use of/access to dormant high street shops etc)  23  8  Take a nationwide, standard approach that makes it easy and possible for people to make changes  14  9  The polluter should pay (e.g. carbon allowance)  14  10  Be financially and geographically fair – including:  11  • •  Not penalising the poor; Measures working for urban and rural areas.  11  Legislation for firms to reduce packaging  0  12  Create an overall differentiated strategy to ensure those who pollute and are super rich pay more than those who are less responsible and/or are less able to pay  0  13  Maintain and promote a healthy standard of living for everyone  0  14  Incentivise consumers to make the right choices through cost/tax (i.e. higher carbon = higher cost)  0  B. Futures After deciding their most important considerations, assembly members moved on to look at the future of ‘what we buy’ for the UK. To aid them in this process, the Expert Leads presented assembly members with three scenarios for possible futures:   Efficiency and old-into-new;    Repairing and sharing;    Less stuff, more equality.  Together these scenarios or ‘possible futures’ cover a broad range of views about what could happen to help the UK meet its 2050 net zero target in terms of what we buy. Assembly members discussed each ‘possible future’ in turn, before voting on them by secret ballot. We start by presenting the rationale for their views, taking each possible future in turn.  Jump to the vote results on page 321  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  311  B.1 Efficiency and old-into-new This possible future would involve businesses making products using less energy and materials, and turning old products into new ones. Individuals wouldn’t necessarily buy fewer things, but the things they buy would be less polluting. This scenario would feature changes for businesses and individuals. What business would do:   Use less energy and/or materials to make things;    Avoid using high-emission materials – e.g. buildings could use more timber than cement;    Use renewable energy (and electricity or hydrogen) instead of fossil fuels, and carbon capture and storage to stop remaining emissions getting into the atmosphere;    Recycle more.  What individuals would do:   Keep products in a good enough state so they can be returned to producers to be turned into new products;    Recycle more.  Assembly members discussed this possible future at their tables. They identified the following pros and cons.  Pros + Employment opportunities – some assembly members felt that this future would provide “additional employment opportunities” or “additional employment opportunities in remanufacturing.” Others noted that it “protects jobs by transitioning into renewable industries.” + Recycling more and reducing waste – some assembly members felt it would lead us to “recycle more”, or “recycle more (less waste to landfill).” Some noted that “sending less waste to landfill saves money and reduces pollution.” + Avoiding high emission materials – some assembly members liked that businesses would “avoid high emission materials” or “avoid using higher emissions materials”, with some saying this meant there would be “no / little impact on individuals.” + Individuals don’t need to change much – some assembly members liked that it requires “little change by individuals” or suggested it would have “minimal impact on people’s lives but still [lead to] positive changes.” Some suggested that it is “more efficient to change manufacturers rather than many individuals.” Others liked that it “doesn’t restrict consumer choice.”  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  312  + Shared responsibility – some assembly members liked that this future “has a large effect on both firms and consumers i.e. not just focussed on consumers.” Others said that “recycling is [for]…business and individuals: like consistency; like shared goal; like standardised.” + Saves money – some assembly members suggested that it “enables money saving”, or meant “saving money – most people are money orientated (motivation).” Others felt that “some producers may save money in [the] long-run by being more efficient.” + Using timber – some assembly members liked the “change to timber frame buildings” or “using timber: innovation; new architecture; restore eco-systems.” + Using renewable energy – some assembly members liked the “use of renewable energy”, the “increased use of renewable energy”, or “renewable energy [and] carbon capture and storage.” + “Easy to implement”  Cons − Very business led – some assembly members disliked that it “deferred responsibility from the individual to the manufacturer” or that there is “less that individuals can do to change things – very business led.” Others noted that it “need[s] industry to change practices – may need incentives / training” or that “there could be difficulty enforcing regulations for businesses.” − Cost – some assembly members commented that it would result in “increased costs.” Others suggested that it would be “expensive in the short term” or that there “may be upfront cost[s] for some measures.” − Job losses and impact on building trade – some assembly members said it would put “jobs at risk.” Others expressed concerns about “job losses – steel”, “cement and steel manufacturing – what will replace these materials / jobs?” or “timber / raw material imported from overseas – building trades lost [in UK}.” − Does it go far enough? – some assembly members noted that “efficiency has increased – will the gains in efficiency be enough? Concern it won’t.” Others queried “less public engagement – does this go far enough to meet net zero?” or commented “efficiency has increased but consumption has increased more, so [it] won’t work if incentives aren’t provided [to individuals] for green technology.” − Will products last? – some assembly members asked “will those new materials be strong enough in 20 years, with a changing climate.” Others felt that “consumers may not follow manufacturers’ instructions (e.g. maintenance and cleaning). Therefore products may not last as long.” − Doubts about repairs – some assembly members queried “is repairing broken products on a large scale practical?” Others suggested that “transport may be required for larger items to be sent or returned post repair.”  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  313  − “Increase[d] use of timber” − “No benefits for individuals – motivate” − “Carbon storage”5  Some assembly members noted conditions to their support for this possible future, or points that they felt would help its implementation:  5 6  7    Just Transition6 – some said that “industries and jobs need to adjust – need to manage a Just Transition”;    Training – some talked about the need for “suitable training courses for repair/ renew employees”;    Carbon capture – some said they would want “carbon capture – but need more information.”7 Others suggested we should “use natural carbon capture rather than carbon capture and storage”;    Need other measures too – some said it “would have to be alongside other actions.”  The assembly went on to discuss carbon capture and storage in detail. Their thoughts and recommendations on it are presented in chapter nine. There is no one agreed definition of what a Just Transition entails, but broadly it relates to who bears the cost of taking action on climate change. The Scottish Government’s Just Transition Commission, which published its interim report in February 2020, suggested that, “The imperative of a just transition is that Governments design policies in a way that ensures the benefits of climate change action are shared widely, while the costs do not unfairly burden those least able to pay, or whose livelihoods are directly or indirectly at risk as the economy shifts and changes.” https://www.gov.scot/publications/transition-commission-interim-report/, page 2. The assembly went on to look at ways to remove greenhouses gases from the atmosphere in detail. Their recommendations on this topic are presented in chapter nine.  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  314  When we asked assembly members to vote on the three possible futures, this future received strong support from assembly members. Please see below for the results of the vote.  B.2 Repairing and sharing This possible future would involve making products that last longer, and people renting/sharing more and owning less. It would feature changes for businesses and individuals. What business would do:   Use less energy and/or materials to make things;    Make products that last longer;    Bring in systems for sharing, offer repair services etc.    Recycle more.  What individuals would do:   Replace products less frequently – e.g. half as often;    Use fewer disposable things and reuse more things – e.g. using fewer disposable cups and more reusable ones;    Own less and share or rent more – e.g. renting toys or tools;    Get things repaired instead of throwing them away;    Buy more second-hand rather than new things;    Sell or gift products after use, or return them to the retailer/manufacturer, rather than throwing them away;    Recycle more.  Assembly members discussed this possible future at their tables. They identified the following pros and cons.  Pros + Sharing goods instead of owning – some assembly members felt that “renting for specific goods can be great, e.g. children’s shoes renting costs less and [is] better for the environment.” Others suggested that “sharing (cars) makes more sense”, that “certain things are fine to rent: roof rack for your car (for your weekend) other things would be difficult” or that “sharing is great as it helps recycle instead of landfill (Freecycle8, social media etc).” Some liked the idea of “prioritising monthly subscriptions, leases and renting.”  8  This is a reference to The Freecycle Network www.freecycle.org  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  315  + Community and wellbeing benefits – some assembly members said it “could offer wellbeing and community benefits” or noted “well-being – social activities – repair cafes etc.” Others said that “repair shops [mean] … well-being and community benefits – social interaction and fill empty high streets.” + Engagement and empowerment – some assembly members said that “people will feel more empowered to make the right decisions” or that there was potential for “engaging local communities.” + Repairs – several assembly members liked the idea of “promoting repairing”, or “sending products back to manufacturers”. + Less waste – some assembly members supported “the idea of everyone recycling all waste household products (including food / garden waste)” or people “using less disposable things.” Others said that “sending less waste to landfill saves money and reduces pollution.” + Skills and employment – some assembly members felt there would be “additional job opportunities”, “increased employment opportunities”, or “additional employment opportunities in product repair and servicing.” Some liked the idea of “sharing skills and bringing back lost trades.” + Saving and making money – some assembly members suggested that “individuals can save money if products last longer and can be repaired.” Others noted “opportunities for individuals to make money by selling used items” or an opportunity to “save / make money.” + Products that last longer – some assembly members commented that “quality products last longer and require less maintenance.” Others liked that this future means we “use less energy / things last longer (repairable).” + “Change in individuals’ behaviour – a less consumerist society/more money” + “Builds on the current service economy therefore easier to implement” + “Buy more second-hand clothes. Baby clothes?”  Cons − Will industry change? – some assembly members asked “how can we convince companies to make products that last longer – they will lose money”, or queried “industries to change – will they?” Others commented that this future “needs industry to change practices – may need incentives and training” or “industries to change – profits / incentives.” − Attitudes, including to sharing and buying second-hand – some assembly members felt “it would require a change in attitude towards using products” or said the “stigma about second hand items needs to change.” Others questioned “how to change mindsets on sharing and buying second hand” or commented “there is a perception that people do not want to repair, share or rent: although it is a good thing that needs exploring.” − Cost of products – some assembly members said that “products may cost more if they are made to last longer.”  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  316  − Cost of renting and repairing – some assembly members were concerned about the “cost of renting” or said that the “cost of repairs can be as much as buying new.” Others felt that “rental [costs] would have to be substantially lower than [the] cost to buy.” − Inconvenience of renting and repairing – some assembly members said that “repairing and renting things may be more inconvenient than buying new” or commented “repairing / renting inconvenience – time.” Some said they “like [the] idea of repairing and sharing but just don’t see it working because it is so easy now to order a new product off the internet.” − Trust in quality of products – some assembly members said there was “no guarantee that the product will be up to standard and last” or that they would need “confidence in [the] longevity of recycled products.” − Job losses – some assembly members highlighted the “potential loss of jobs” or the “financial impact on businesses / jobs.” − “Unless sharing is organised and incentivised, very unrealistic” − “Especially sharing or renting tools has unintended side effects (e.g. driving to shop and instead buy new as you don’t have tools at hand)” − “Need knowledge to do repair. Need time” − “A health risk? Cross contamination infections” − “It is difficult: would require training”  Some assembly members noted conditions to their support for this possible future, or points that they felt would help its implementation:   Information – some said that “items that are rented or shared should have appropriate information regarding care and use.”    Changes to product design – some suggested that “products will need to be redesigned with easy to repair features and diagnostic parts (e.g. to fridge etc).”    Ease of recycling – some said we need to “make the recycling process easy – e.g. label how to recycle the item.”  When we asked assembly members to vote on the three possible futures, this future received some support from assembly members.  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  317  B.3 Less stuff, more equality This possible future would involve people earning less and buying less, with them spending more time fixing and making things. It would feature changes for businesses and individuals: What business would do:   Make products that last longer;    Employ people in more flexible ways and/or for fewer hours;    Bring in systems for sharing, offering repair services, etc.    Recycle more.  What individuals would do:   Be taxed more if they are on higher incomes, or everyone could be given a ‘carbon allowance’. This could result in less inequality;    Work fewer hours or in more flexible ways – e.g. working from home. This could mean that people had more time to repair things or make things themselves, and this could be rewarded with ‘community currencies’.    Buy less stuff, including replacing products less frequently – e.g. half as often;    Use fewer disposable things and reuse more things – e.g. using fewer disposable cups and more reusable ones;    Buy more second-hand rather than new things;    Recycle more.  Assembly members discussed this possible future at their tables. They identified the following pros and cons.  Pros + Wellbeing and quality of life – some assembly members said that “flexible working leads to more quality family time”, or that it would result in “more leisure and family time.” Some liked the idea of “less working hours – flexible working to suit lifestyle.” Others suggested it would “improve people’s wellbeing and community” or “could improve wellbeing by working less and increasing time for leisure, family etc.” + Recycling and less waste – some assembly members liked that we would “recycle more”, “recycling!” or that “everything [would be] produced so it can be recycled.” Others said that it “uses fewer disposables” or that “less disposable means less waste.” Some welcomed that we would “send less to landfill – local councils to consider options.” + Repairing, sharing and renting – some assembly members liked the idea of “sharing / repair services”, “swap shops / centres”, “recycle shops / centres” or “renting appliances / rental plans.” Others talked about the “social and financial benefits of collective sharing and leasing.”  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  318  + Benefits to the environment and biodiversity – some assembly members felt it would be “better for [the] environment” or suggested that “using less raw materials benefits biodiversity and [creates] less landfill.” + Equality – some assembly members liked the idea of “taxing higher earners” or “less difference in income between richest and poorest.” + Longer lasting products and saving money – some assembly members talked about “longer lasting products” or said “individuals could save money in [the] long-run if products last longer [or are] better quality.” + “Less stuff” + “If demand decrease is targeted at high carbon goods and services [it will have] great effects (e.g. decreased imports). This will also help balance of payments deficits.” + “Local currencies have been around forever (e.g. bartering/LETS,9 Bristol pound)” + “Carbon allowance”  Cons − Working less is unappealing and counterproductive – some assembly members stated that “less working [is] not good” or that there would be “more social unrest if people have more time available.” Others disliked that “they want us to work longer age wise, but less days/ hours when you are fit and able.” Some identified a “risk that having more spare time will lead to more consumption” or that “working less means more time to buy more stuff with less money.” − Job loss and economic damage – some assembly members suggested that “jobs will be at risk (industries)”, that GDP [will be] down [and] unemployment up” or that “some industries [and] jobs will be at risk (e.g. manufacturing).” Others said it would make the UK “less internationally competitive, therefore less exports, therefore GDP down, therefore lower incomes may become a spiral if not controlled.” − Hard work not incentivised – some assembly members felt there would be “less incentive for people to work harder.” Others were concerned about an “impact on social class movement – why work harder to get taxed more?” Some said that if you “limit earnings… [there is] less incentive to become industry leaders.” − Reduced income for high earners – some assembly members disliked “higher income [being] taxed more” or “reduce[d] income for [the] highest earners.” − Behaviour change unrealistic – some assembly members noted that this future would need a “change in individuals’ values and lifestyle towards buying less (social barriers and fashion)” or said that “people might be reluctant to change behaviour in big ways.” Some felt that “people working less will not use [their] spare time to repair things.”  9  LETS (Local Exchange Trading Systems) are community-based networks in which people exchange goods and services with one another, instead of using money (https://www.letslinkuk.net/).  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  319  − Forced social change – some assembly members were concerned that this option would require “forced social change (using free time)” or would “chang[e] people’s lives (e.g. less money, buying less).” Some said “people should have a choice. People like to have stuff. […] They love buying stuff. People like to buy new. That’s human nature.” − Preferable to buy new – some assembly members noted that it’s “sometimes cheaper to buy new” or that “repairing things [is] more inconvenient than buying new.” − Affordability and product costs – some assembly members suggested that “low income earner[s] may not be able to afford necessities” or that there may be an “increase in product costs.” Others asked “if working less how would we ensure people could afford to live? Companies can’t afford to pay more for less hours.” − “Lead[s] to a culture whereby people believe society owes them something rather than [asking] what people can do for society.” − “More income equals more tax for carbon emissions – may be unfair if not producing most carbon emissions” − “Change will not happen quickly” − “Need industry to change practices – may need incentives and training.” − “Carbon allowance [would be] difficult to monitor and implement.”  Some assembly members noted conditions to their support for this possible future, or points that they felt would help its implementation   Recycling – some said that “recycling needs to be more available”;    Need to change values – some said that a “change in values is a condition for change in behaviour.”  When we asked assembly members to vote on the three possible futures, this future received limited support from assembly members.  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  320  Vote results Assembly members voted on the futures by secret ballot. There were two different ballot papers. The first ballot paper asked assembly members how much they agreed or disagreed that each future should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. The second ballot paper asked them to rank the futures in their order of preference.  Figure 1: Possible futures  How much do you agree or disagree that each of the possible futures should be part of how the UK gets to net zero? (%) % 100  3%  15%  9%  Strongly disagree  12%  24%  Disagree  30%  18%  Don’t mind/unsure  58% 50  Agree  30% 39%  Strongly agree  42% 18%  0 Efficiency and old-into-new  Repairing and sharing  Less stuff, more equality  The votes from this second ballot paper were counted in two ways:   Counting assembly members’ first preference votes only. This tells us what assembly members would and wouldn’t choose if they could have their most preferred future.    Using Borda count. This involves allocating points for preferences – a first preference vote scored two points, a second preference vote one point and a third preference no points. Counting the votes like this tells us which futures are most acceptable to the greatest number of assembly members.  Assembly members showed significant support for two futures:   97% of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that ‘efficiency and old into new’ should be part of how the UK gets to net zero;    72% ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ with ‘repairing and sharing’. 15% of assembly members ‘disagreed’ with this possible future; no one ‘strongly disagreed’.  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  321  Assembly members were less supportive of ‘less stuff, more equality.’ 48% of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that it should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. 24% ‘disagreed’ and 9% ‘strongly disagreed’. 18% were unsure.  Figure 2: Possible futures  Please rank the possible futures in order of preference (% 1st preference votes)  % 60  52%  33%  30  15% 0 Efficiency and old-into-new  Figure 3: Possible futures  Repairing and sharing  Less stuff, more equality  50  Please rank the possible futures in order of preference (Borda count)  44 40  25  15  0 Efficiency and old-into-new  Repairing and sharing  Less stuff, more equality  The ranking votes reinforced these results. ‘Efficiency and old-into-new’ remained the most popular future, with 52% of first preference votes. ‘Repairing and sharing’ came second with 33% of votes, followed by ‘less stuff, more equality’ with 15%. The Borda count scores followed the same pattern, although with a smaller difference in popularity between ‘efficiency and old-intonew’ and ‘repairing and sharing’.  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  322  Futures – conclusions Overall, assembly members backed a future in which both businesses and individuals would need to change some aspects of their current practices and behaviours. For businesses, assembly members strongly supported a future in which they would:   Make products using less, and lower carbon, energy and materials;    Turn old products into new ones, and recycle more.  They also supported steps that businesses could take to help people buy less, including making longer lasting products, and offering repair services and sharing systems. For individuals, assembly members backed a move towards greater sharing and repairing, as opposed to buying new goods. They did not, overall support bigger shifts in how society works aimed at reducing the amount we buy, for example changes to how much people work and earn. Assembly members consistently welcomed opportunities for job creation, reduced waste and increased recycling. They noted that sharing would work well for specific items such children’s shoes, and felt it had potential benefits for communities and wellbeing.  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  323  Assembly members tended to see potential increased costs for consumers and negative impacts on specific economic sectors as concerns. They emphasised the importance of a Just Transition for those adversely affected by the changes. They also highlighted the need for plans to be realistic, suggesting for example changes to product design and information to make items easier to care for and repair.  C. Policy options After considering the future of ‘what we buy’, assembly members moved on to consider how we might get there. Specifically, they looked at policy options in three areas: 1.  Reducing emissions from products and services;  2.  Buying less;  3.  Increasing recycling.  For each of these areas, the Expert Leads recapped and explained potential policy options. Assembly members discussed these ideas in their groups before voting by secret ballot. They were also able to note additional suggestions for policy measures.  C.1 Reducing emissions from products and services Assembly members looked at six policy options for reducing emissions from products and services:   Resource efficiency targets and standards;    Taxes on producers, products and services;    Extended producer responsibility;    Amended procedure for awarding government contracts;    Voluntary agreements;    Labelling and information.  We start by presenting the rationale for their views, taking each policy option in turn.  Jump to the vote results on page 332  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  324  Resource efficiency targets and standards This policy option would involve industry ensuring that it met certain levels of resource and/ or energy efficiency. For example, it might mean that products could only be sold if they met rules for how long they last, whether they can be repaired or reused, and/or how much energy or materials went into making them. The targets and standards could apply to all industry or only to high-emitting sectors, such as construction and fashion. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about resource efficiency targets and standards.  Pros + Quick win – some assembly members described them as “quick wins – removing [the] most polluting products cuts greenhouse gas emissions” or said the UK would “see effects quickly.” Other said that “setting regulations at top level [is the] fastest option.” + Enforcing change – some assembly members liked that they “can be done by legislation” or that it’s “government enforcing change and drawing [a] line in [the] sand and [being] bold.” + Better production and design – some assembly members suggested they allowed for “changes from start of production” or that they would “promp[t] better design.” + “Saves firms money in long run so they will support” + “Already know it works (already having an impact)”  Cons − “Restricts choice” − “Increased product costs” − “Complicated to set up and inspect”  Some assembly members noted conditions that they would want to see in order to support this policy option, or that they felt would help its implementation:   Include all industries – some said that it “should target all industries (more fair) but could tailor”;    Protect consumers – some said they would support it “if consumers [are] protected from increased costs”;    Take account of imports – some said it “must take into account products from outside [the] UK” or asked “how would this work for imports?”;  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  325    Needs correct assessment of carbon emissions – some said that it would need “assessment of [the] product from cradle to grave”, that it should take account of the “carbon footprint of products not just from production but how far they have travelled too”, or noted that it “depends on [the] correct carbon measurement / footprint.”  Taxes on producers, products and services This policy option would involve (a) reducing or scrapping taxes on greener products or services to make them cheaper; and/or (b) raising taxes on more polluting products and services to make them more expensive. It could include taxes on advertising that go up according to the carbon content of the product or service being advertised. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about taxes on producers, products and services.  Pros + Impact – some assembly members said its “already proved to be working with energy use – keep going!” or that it’s “possible and could make a difference.” Some suggested we would “see effects quickly” or liked that it’s “government enforcing change and bold.” + Encourages better producer behaviour – some assembly members said it “encourages better producer behaviour” or that reduced “taxes on greener products [would make them]… more attractive to businesses.” + “No downsides” + “Tackles advertising” + “Carbon tax based on carbon footprint labelling/scoring” + “Makes green products more affordable” + “Increases investment from other countries if tax regime is favourable” + “Can be transparent legislation for businesses”  Cons − May not change consumer behaviour – some assembly members said that the “wealthy could continue to buy less green options” or that it “might not actually make people buy less e.g. if cost not driving factor.”10 − “Restricts choice” − “Might be hard to negotiate”  10  Assembly members considered ‘taxes on producers, products and services’ both as a way to reduce emissions from products and services, and as a way to encourage people to buy less (please see page 341). Assembly members made this point when they were considering the impacts of the taxes on consumer behaviour.  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  326  − “Don’t like additional tax” − “Consumers may choose imports without this tax” − “May encourage UK producers to move abroad for carbon-heavy goods”  Some assembly members noted conditions that they would want to see in order to support this policy option, or that they felt would help its implementation:   Protect consumers – some queried “will these [costs] just be transferred to [the] consumer?”;    Ring-fence the tax revenue – some said that the “tax revenue [should be] ring-fenced for carbon offsetting” or that the “tax must be ring-fenced to be spent on climate change”;    Take imports into account – some said we should “tax imported goods as well” or asked “how would this work for imports?”;    Reward but don’t punish – some asked for a “focus on rewards not punishment.” Others suggested “what about tax exemptions – would be positive.”  Extended producer responsibility Extended producer responsibility would mean that producers pay for the impact of their products and packaging on climate change. It could also include either or both of:   Restrictions on the practice of intentionally making products that don’t last long;    Requirements for how long products need to last.  The UK government is already planning to introduce extended producer responsibility for packaging and may do so for other products.11 Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about extended producer responsibility.  Pros + Impact – some assembly members said that “firms paying for their impact…will lead to firms’ behaviour change” or that it “already works – legislation makes companies produce low carbon products.” Others said it “reduces how much producers pollute + what they do with that pollution.” + Longer lasting products and better services – some assembly members said that “built in redundancy [i.e. products built not to last] should be made illegal” or that “if [products] are made to last longer then it’ll be worthwhile.” Others said it would result in companies “offering better services / builds stronger relationship.”  11  https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/packaging-waste-changing-the-uk-producer-responsibility-systemfor-packaging-waste  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  327  + “Reduces waste” + “Government enforcing change.”  Cons − Only the UK – some assembly members disliked that it “only affects UK industry.” Others said it would be “impossible to implement because of current manufacturing standards abroad”, that it would be “difficult to hold foreign companies to account” or that “international trades (e.g. products from China) make it difficult to guarantee extended producer responsibility.” − “May increase firms’ costs and so may cause them to go abroad” “Too much focus on recycling, but need to look at reduction”  −  − “Restricts choice” − “We don’t know what it will cost” − “For how long should products last – not always producers’ fault (depends on consumer)” − “Not strong enough, could be a cost absorbed by the business. Would need to be a fine with consequences e.g. not able trade or sell certain products”  Some assembly members noted conditions that they would want to see in order to support this policy option, or that they felt would help its implementation:   Protect consumers – some asked “will [costs] be just transferred to [the] consumer?”;    Ring-fence any tax revenue – some said that any “tax revenue [should be] ring-fenced for carbon offsetting”;    Combine with resource efficiency targets and standards – some said it “should go hand in hand with 1a [resource efficiency targets and standards] – it’s about making producers be responsible”;    Take account of imports – some said it “must take into account products from outside [the] UK.”  Amended procedure for awarding government contracts This policy option would amend the procedure for awarding government contracts, so that it giving preference to low carbon companies and products. It could involve creating an approved list of low carbon technologies, products or materials (e.g. renewable energy, the use of wood in building construction, recycled materials) for use by public sector bodies. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about amending government contracts in this way.  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  328  Pros + Government leadership – some assembly members said that “government should take the lead” or that “government are big spenders [which means they have] big impact and influence.” + Benefits for green companies and competition – some assembly members liked that it “makes green companies competitive” or that it would “make green companies more competitive so would encourage competition between companies.” Others liked that it’s “rewarding companies that are low-carbon.” + “Healthy for reducing carbon in products” + “Doesn’t restrict product choice” + “Simple and easy to do” + “No brainer”  Cons − “Not enough – business in private sector” − “Could lead to higher cost to taxpayer” − “Complex – carbon can’t be the only factor. Also cost, timescale”  Some assembly members noted conditions that they would want to see in order to support this policy option, or that they felt would help its implementation:   Budget – some said government and public sector bodies “must have [the] budget to pay for more expensive but green products / services”;    Standards – some suggested it “needs standards – legislation”;    Governance – some assembly members questioned “who …[the] governing body [would be].”  Voluntary agreements Voluntary agreements mean trade organisations, producers and/or retailers adopting voluntary commitments. They would commit to reducing carbon emissions from the production or use of products, and/or to only selling low carbon products. There could be rankings and awards, so that product manufacturers and sellers are publicly celebrated for low carbon performance. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about voluntary agreements  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  329  Pros + Promoting competition and spreading best practice – some assembly members suggested that it “can help promote competition and spread best practice amongst businesses.” Others said “firms respond to reputation risks / opportunities” or that they liked that it was “not strict and promotes competition.” + Awards and rewards – some assembly members said that “consumers do pay attention to ranking and awards” or liked that there “can be [an] advertising plus for companies – rewards there.” + “Gives choice”  Cons − Won’t create change – some assembly members disliked that it’s “voluntary” saying that we “need to force people to change”, or that it “won’t amount to enough – must force change.” Others said that voluntary agreements are “not bold enough on their own”, that “businesses might take easy options” or that “voluntary agreements [are] not worth the paper they are written on…profits trump everything.” − “Can’t trust companies / may present biased info”  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  330  Some assembly members noted conditions that they would want to see in order to support this policy option, or that they felt would help its implementation:   Independent – some said it “can’t be industry-run; it has to be independent” or that “awards must be given by [an] independent body”;    Take services into account – some asked “how [would it] work for services?”  Labelling and information Labelling would show the carbon emissions caused by different products and services. Labels could also show which products are more durable and designed for reuse. This could be accompanied by information campaigns. These would educate individuals about the emissions caused by different products and services, and how to reduce them. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about labelling and information  Pros + Consumer choice – some assembly members liked that there are “still consumer choices”, that it “gives choice”, “gives consumer[s] the choice” or that it’s “not strict and [is] voluntary.” Others felt it “respects [the] public and gives choice.” + Increasing awareness – some assembly members said that “knowledge is power” or that it “brings [it to] people’s attention.” Others said that “[education and awareness for consumers was] our top principle.”12 + Will lead to change – some assembly members said they “think it will lead to behaviour change e.g. smoking campaign”, that they “think people would change”, or that “visual things impact people.” + “The manufacturers’ incentives” + “Easy and simple – traffic light system”  Cons − Won’t create change – some assembly members felt it was “not bold enough on its own” or that it “might not change purchase of familiar products.” Others described it as “light touch – how much difference is it actually going to make? Easy thing to do – probably won’t make a huge impact.” − “Harder to trace products’ carbon from abroad”  No assembly members noted conditions for this policy option.  12  Please see Section A at the start of this chapter.  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  331  General comments Some assembly members made general comments about policies to reduce emissions from products and services. Many of these comments touched on the idea of trust. Some mentioned it directly. Others expressed concerns about company behaviour and compliance, emphasised the need for regulation, or called for transparency: What a total nightmare! i.e. a minefield of complexity and avoidance, and ‘gentlemen’s “ agreements’ between companies – transnational and international.”  “ How to regulate?” Penalties, charges or taxes against those who create polluting products should be made “ public and transparent. [There] [s]hould be real and significant fines and consequences that act as a real deterrent.” Important for [the] ‘ordinary person’ to be able to trust labelling and marketing “ messages. Can Government reward ‘honesty’ and punish dishonesty.” Like honesty and transparency … but how to be confident of [it]? Independent scrutiny “ body? Outside and independent of government.” Other assembly members said that “government should set standards”, that we should look for “quick wins”, or that they liked measures that “encourag[e] better design.” Some said they “like [the] suggestion of [a] Carbon Tax that applies to all companies regardless of where they’re based ifthey trade/operate in [the] UK.”  Vote results Assembly members voted by secret ballot on policy options for reducing emissions from products and services. There were two ballot papers. The first ballot paper asked assembly members how much they agreed or disagreed that each policy option should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. The second ballot paper asked them to rank the options in their order of preference. The votes from this second ballot paper were counted both in terms of first preference votes and via Borda count.

Only a small number of assembly members ‘strongly disagreed’ or ‘disagreed’ with any of these proposals. No one disagreed with ‘labelling and information’. In contrast, only a minority of assembly members (42%) backed voluntary agreements, with 37% ‘strongly disagreeing’ or ‘disagreeing’ that they should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. 20% of assembly members said they were ‘unsure’ or ‘didn’t mind’.

They were followed by the three other proposals that received strong support in the first vote. Voluntary agreements remained the least popular option.  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  334  C.2 Buying less Assembly members looked at six policy options around ‘buying less’:   Advertising bans or restrictions;    Changes to income tax or working hours;    Personal carbon allowances;    Measures to enable product sharing;    Taxes on producers, products and services;    Extended producer responsibility.  We start by presenting the rationale for their views, taking each policy option in turn.  Jump to the vote results on page 341  Advertising bans or restrictions An advertising ban would stop polluting products or sectors, like fast fashion, being allowed to advertise. Advertising restrictions could limit advertising around towns or in other public spaces. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about advertising bans or restrictions.  Pros + Impact – some assembly members suggested that “advertising has a large impact on consumption therefore this policy will have a large impact” or said they liked the idea of “advertising restrictions to reduce consumerist behaviour.” + Target worst polluters – some assembly members liked that it “can target [the] worst carbon offenders” or that an “advertising ban would take the spotlight off more polluting products.” + Practical – some assembly members said it “felt [the] most practical and implementable” or that it can “easily be done.” + “Should do it, even if small difference” + “Retains consumer choice e.g. smoking”  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  335  Cons − Might not be effective – some assembly members said it was “not clear how effective it would be”, or that it “won’t make [a] big difference.” − Hard to implement – some assembly members said it would be “really difficult to implement (i.e. advertising versus PR or comms)” or asked “can advertising bans work if the internet is hard to police?” Others commented that “restricting ‘negative’ advertising and marketing…and promoting ‘good and responsible’ advertising is ok … but very difficult to regulate online?” − “Negative impact on [the] economy if buying less” − “Adverts can do good as well e.g. smoking”  Some assembly members noted conditions that they would want to see in order to support this policy option, or that they felt would help its implementation:   What is banned – some assembly members said they would want “advertising restrictions or bans with [a] particular emphasis on junk foods, high sugar, fast fashion etc”, or that they supported a “selective ban on advertising for high carbon footprint products (not [a] blanket ban) based on scoring.” Others disagreed, saying we should “ban all adverts.” Some said any bans or restrictions “nee[d] to be [based on] facts.”    Take a positive approach instead – some assembly members suggested that to avoid negative economic impacts you could “encourage positive advertising instead? e.g. for green products.”    Who is targeted – some assembly members said that bans should be “for adults, not just children.”  Changes to income tax or working hours This policy option could involve people on higher incomes being taxed at an increased rate (e.g. 60%+ rather than 45%). Alternatively, it could mean a limit on working hours, such as the introduction of a four-day week. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about changes to income tax or working hours.  Pros + “Four day week would be a positive thing if vulnerable people are protected” + “Fair for high earners (therefore high carbon) to pay more”  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  336  Cons − Unrealistic – some assembly members said it is “not going to happen”, is “non sense” or is “not politically viable (Conservative Government).” − Unfair on high earners – some said it is “not fair to penalise those who earn more” or “unfair to assume individual high earners are using lots of carbon.” − Avoidance – some assembly members suggested that “some people will move money abroad.” − Affordability – some assembly said we “can’t reduce salaries – people can’t afford it” or queried “how to have a four day week and make sure lower socioeconomic groups have enough money….” − Impact on certain sectors – some assembly members commented that it “could be difficult to implement for those in caring professions” or queried “how to have a four day week … [how to ensure] the NHS and care professions are protected.” − “Doesn’t take into account individual circumstances” − “Reduction in hours – would initially have to be voluntary” − “People hate tax. We’re taxed enough already” − “Can still make carbon on days off” − “Not clear how this could work effectively … very complex” − “Those who create wealth could have limited potential”  Some assembly members noted conditions that they would want to see in order to support this policy option, or that they felt would help its implementation:   Ring-fence tax revenue – some said that they would want “tax revenue ring-fenced for carbon offsetting”;    Reduce consumption first – some said there would need to be a “reduction in consumer need first [before moving to a four-day week], otherwise competitors [abroad] could win contracts [for the UK market] based on outputs / production volumes”;    Focus on different types of work – some said policy-makers should “focus on different types of work – e.g. condensed/flexible hours or work[ing] from home.”  Personal carbon allowances Personal carbon allowances involve individuals having annual ‘budgets’ to ‘spend’ depending on the impact of their purchases. Everyone would have the same number of credits to start with, but schemes could include permission for credits to be traded or owed, like money. Assembly members identified a number of pros and cons about personal carbon allowances.  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  337  Pros + Choice, including considered choice – some assembly members liked that “you can choose how you use [the] allowance.” Others liked that it “will make people think about choices” or that it “unitises the carbon use (you can see how much an air fare is losing for instance).” + “Would be effective at tackling carbon if it was possible” + “New way of doing things”  Cons − Trading credits would increase inequality and allow the rich to exploit the poor – some assembly members said that “extra credit could be purchased by high earners – exploiting low income / vulnerable people whilst not impacting their lifestyles.” Others said that “trading might have bad consequences (e.g. going without heating)”, that it would “increase inequality” or that it “favours [the] rich, buying from [the] poor.” − Access to essential items and freedoms – some assembly members talked about the “risk of unforeseen circumstances [meaning] … people can’t buy food”, or noted that you “can’t always choose how much carbon you use e.g. disabled [people].” Others said a “carbon allowance can take away people’s freedom of travel or movement.” Some said they had “fears over rationing.” − Problematic to enforce – some assembly members suggested it would be “impossible to administer / police”, or “open to abuse.” Others said it would entail “big brother monitoring.” Some asked “how do you prevent richer individuals finding ways to circumvent carbon allowances?” − Impractical – some assembly members felt it was “too complicated for normal people” or said they had concerns around “practicality.” Others said it would be “nice if it worked but not sure it’s practical.” − “Concern it wont be accepted ‘at the top’ (politicians)” − “Don’t know how much it would cost to set up” − “Bad for [the] economy” − “Too communist”  Some assembly members noted conditions that they would want to see in order to support this policy option, or that they felt would help its implementation:   No trading – some said there should be “no trading” or that those responsible should “ban ‘trading’ – should be a set price to buy”;    Fairness – some said it “needs to be done fairly and [be] properly controlled.” Others said they would support it only if “it’s fair across the board”;  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  338    Accounting for personal circumstances – some said that a “personal carbon allowance needs to account for circumstances and location e.g. having a disabled child in Scotland will require more carbon consumption to access help.” Others asked “how [would it] wor[k] for children, [or those with] additional needs or [a] disability?”;    Only for large ticket items – some assembly members said personal carbon allowances could be used “only [for] large ticket item[s]…and things that are simple to quantify”, suggesting it would work for “flying… not food.” Others felt personal allowances would be “unwieldy and difficult as a broad approach. However, [they] could be applied to big ticket items and travel but some dispensations would be necessary.” Some suggested that “personal carbon allowances could work for some big item spends / services (e.g. flights / car purchases) but [that it] feels unworkable across a wider range”, or that they “could be applied to big ticket items over a longer period of time e.g. number of flights over 5 years.”  Some assembly members noted conditions that they would want to see in order to support this policy option, or that they felt would help its implementation. Some said they would “prefer [an] award / reward system” as opposed to one that penalises people. Others suggested that those responsible would need to be “strict with fines”, or that it “feels like a last resort – like rationing.”  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  339  Measures to enable product sharing This policy option would involve creating systems for more shared ownership. It might include:   Laws to ensure that businesses offering rentals or sharing are trustworthy and low carbon;    Incentives for manufacturers to design products which are easily shared (e.g. durable, identifiable);    Technical and financial support to businesses who offer sharing/renting;    Giving individuals incentives to take products back after use (e.g. paying a deposit which is returned depending on how well-kept the product is).  Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about measures to enable product sharing.  Pros + Returning products – some assembly members commented that it’s “good to return phones and technology”, that they “liked [the idea of] returning bought products”. + Practical and workable – some assembly members said it is “practical” or that they had “seen it working already e.g. reusable cups at festivals.” + Encourages sharing – some assembly members said they felt “enabling product sharing is very positive.” Others said they liked that it “encourages sharing – i.e. cars or house swaps – social/well being.” + “Encourages looking after of goods – rewards” + “Good idea to regulate i.e. trustworthy” + “Good idea in principle”  Cons − Impractical for some sectors – some assembly members said it is “unfeasible for certain sectors – i.e. emergency services” or “cars (e.g. legal dimension of insurance / speeding tickets).” − Won’t have desired effect – some assembly members suggested it is “not as effective” or that we’re “already doing it with cars – doesn’t reduce demand.” − People won’t look after things if they don’t own them – some assembly members talked about the “risks [of] irresponsible borrowers” or our “culture: if don’t own, don’t value/ look after.”  No assembly members noted conditions about this policy idea.  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  340  Taxes on producers, products and services The final two policy options that assembly members considered in this category were ‘taxes on producers, products and services’ and ‘extended producer responsibility’. Assembly members had already discussed these policy measures as ways to reduce emissions from products and services. Here they considered whether or not to encourage people to buy less. Assembly members’ views on the pros and cons of these options are included on pages 326 and 327 above.  General comments A small number of assembly members made general comments about policies to reduce the amount we buy. Some suggested that measures in this area “will increase employment in certain roles or job types” or that “we need to learn from others.” Some commented that an “increase in tax will be unlikely to change behaviours.”  Vote results Assembly members voted by secret ballot on policy options to encourage people to buy less. There were two ballot papers. The first ballot paper asked assembly members how much they agreed or disagreed that each policy option should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. The second ballot paper asked them to rank the options in their order of preference. The votes from this second ballot paper were counted both in terms of first preference votes and via Borda count. A clear majority of assembly members’ ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that four out of the six policy measures should be part of how the UK gets to net zero:   Taxes on producers, products and services – 83%    Enabling product sharing – 77%    Extended producer responsibility – 74%    Advertising bans and restrictions – 74%  Few assembly members supported ‘changes to income tax or working hours’ (17%) or ‘personal carbon allowances’ (25%). A majority of assembly members ‘strongly disagreed’ or ‘disagreed’ with both these policies, with levels of disagreement reaching 75% for ‘changes to income tax or working hours’.

These were followed by the two other policies that had scored well in the first vote. ‘Personal carbon allowances’ and ‘changes to income tax or working hours’ remained the least popular options.  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  343  C.3 Increasing recycling Assembly members looked at six options for increasing recycling:   Recycling requirements;    Pay-as-you-throw schemes;    Deposit return schemes;    Increased doorstep recycling;    Grants and incentives for business;    Product labelling and information campaigns.  We start by presenting the rationale for their views, taking each policy option in turn.  Jump to the vote results on page 351  Recycling requirements Recycling requirements would involve retailers and/or consumers being responsible for recycling products, with a ban on landfilling. It could eventually mean that councils do not collect ‘black bin’ rubbish. The requirements could be phased in over many years to allow individuals and businesses time to adapt. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about recycling requirements.  Pros + Change in company practice – some assembly members said it “will encourage greener products from companies” or that “recycling requirements are great as it forces firms to change, therefore there will be a large impact.” + “Would increase recycling” + “Would reduce emissions” + “Good principle” + “Less cost with no black bins” + “Reducing landfill”  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  344  Cons − Fly-tipping – some assembly members noted “concern about fly-tipping”, the “risk of fly-tipping” or fears about “making fly-tipping worse.” Some said that “if councils do not collect ‘black bin’ rubbish [we would have] fears over litter and fly-tipping”, or queried what would happen to “existing non recyclable items – fly-tipping?” Some suggested that the “introduction of [the] waste licence has already led to fly-tipping” or that “fly-tipping is a consequence of [the] cost of collection of waste.” − Time – some assembly members disliked that it is “not effective immediately” or that it “would have to be phased in.” Others said “it’s a long way away, good idea but need [the] infrastructure. Not a quick win.” − “Can’t get rid of black bins. Will always have waste that can’t be recycled” − “Encourages stream of cars to take things to the tip”  Some assembly members noted conditions that they would want to see in order to support this policy option, or that they felt would help its implementation:   Get on with it – some said “we should set a target soon and don’t wait!”;    Education – some said we “need to educate people [about] how to recycle effectively”;    Standardised approach – some said it “needs to be uniform” or that it “need[s] [a] standardised approach across the country (and packaging labels [that] matc[h] bin colour)”;    Incentivise too – some said they wanted “incentive[s] pair[ed] with requirements in order to make it a ‘better pill to swallow’ therefore firms are more likely to go along with it.”  Pay-as-you-throw schemes Pay-as-you-throw schemes involve individuals and businesses paying for waste that is not recycled (i.e. the amount of waste in their ‘black bin’), but not for recycled or composted waste. The schemes could be introduced with exemptions or to reflect household occupancy (e.g. more bins for more people). Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about pay-as-you-throw schemes.  Pros + Encourages behaviour change – some assembly members suggested it would “encourag[e] people to buy less over time – gets people to recycle who don’t already.” Others said it would “sto[p] bad behaviour”, that “people would improve [their] behaviour” or that “having to pay makes a difference.” + “Increase recycling but less strict than 3a [recycling requirements]” + “Looks like it could work elsewhere”  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  345  Cons − Impact on the less well-off – some assembly members suggested it “could hit low-income households. Everyone is paying council tax already.” Others said it’s “wrong to hit [the] vulnerable”, that it “favours [the] rich, who can afford to throw”, or that “recycling options are worse for low-income areas.” − Fly tipping and anti-social behaviour – some assembly members felt it would “mak[e] fly-tipping worse”, that it would “encourage antisocial waste disposal i.e. in neighbour’s bin” or that it had “fly-tipping risks and putting rubbish in other people’s bins or wrong bins.” − Practicality and enforcement – some assembly members queried “not practical? Weigh as you take it?” Others said “some people won’t pay – makes no difference” or expressed concerns about the “cost of enforcement.” − It won’t work – some assembly members said that “punishing people is not going to work” or that “it sounds like a good idea, but it’s not going to work.”  Some assembly members noted conditions that they would want to see in order to support this policy option, or that they felt would help its implementation:   Avoid impacting the less well-off – some commented that it’s “good but needs to relate to income / [the] tax band of [the] property to avoid impacting low income households”;    Scrap payments – some said they would support it “only if households don’t pay (already pay with council tax)”;    Consider shared bins – some queried “flats/shared bins?”  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  346  Deposit return schemes Deposit return schemes encourage the collection of used containers, so that they can be recycled or reused. The customer pays a small sum on top of the retail price when they buy a product (e.g. a bottled or canned drink), which is refunded when the container is returned to a collection point. The bottle or can is then either refilled or sent for recycling. Deposit return schemes could be extended to incentivise individuals to sort other unwanted goods they own (e.g. clothes, furniture) for reuse, remanufacture or recycling. The UK government has promised a deposit-return scheme for plastic, glass and possibly metal by 2023.13 Assembly members identified a number of pros and cons about deposit return schemes.  Pros + Tried and tested – some assembly members said “it already exists and works – encourages reuse.” Others said “we used to do this and it worked” or that it’s “tried and tested.” Others said it is “like existing European schemes” or that there is “evidence of [it] working abroad.” + Encourages good behaviour – some assembly members suggested it “discourages throwing away including litter” or that it “rewards good behaviour.” Others commented “like this one, good evidence, excuse to pick up litter (incentive).” + “Incentivises people in lower income areas” + “More fair” + “This could be rolled out for cleaning products and then work out how to solve the food problems” + “Simple” + “Already in government plans”  Cons − Need for infrastructure – some assembly members disliked that it “needs infrastructure” or the “infrastructur[e], but mitigated by the benefits of setting up [the] schemes.” − “Some people won’t bother if they don’t understand” − “Open to abuse for people to contaminate the containers”  13  https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/introducing-a-deposit-return-scheme-drs-for-drinks-containersbottles-and-cans/outcome/introducing-a-deposit-return-scheme-drs-in-england-wales-and-northern-irelandexecutive-summary-and-next-steps  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  347  Some assembly members noted conditions that they would want to see in order to support this policy option, or that they felt would help its implementation:   Make it easy and accessible for all – some said they “don’t mind who pays you back i.e. company / council but [it] needs to be easy.” Others said it “needs to be accessible including for disabled people.”    Look at who pays you back – some asked “who gives £ back?”    Try it first – some recommended that we “see how [the] government[’s] existing plans go, then see.”  Increased doorstep recycling Increased doorstep recycling would involve local councils providing doorstep recycling for all recyclable materials. The UK Government has said it will expect all councils to collect at least the same ‘core’ list of recyclable materials from householders, although the exact details / dates are to be confirmed.14 Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about increased doorstep recycling.  Pros + Consistency – some assembly members liked the “consistency”, or that it “gives everyone the same recycling opportunities across the UK.” Others commented that it’s “positive to make recycling collection consistent and standardised. Need all households to compost.” Some suggested that a “standard process for recycling will help clarify the message on what can be recycled.” + Extends current system – some assembly members said it “already exists – should be scaled up – with incentive/penalties.” Others liked that it “extends the current system and [creates a] uniform approach around the country.” + “National policy and central system”  Cons − Extra cost for individuals – some assembly members noted “already high council tax rates – higher costs will inevitably be passed on to individuals.” Others highlighted “concern about cost to [the] taxpayer” or said “councils can’t afford it – higher council tax?” − “Costs for local councils” − “Will still have landfill”  14  https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/environment-bill-2020/10-march-2020-waste-and-resource-efficiencyfactsheet-part-3  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  348  Some assembly members noted conditions that they would want to see in order to support this policy option, or that they felt would help its implementation:   Funding and incentives – some said it “shouldn’t be added to our council tax”, or asked “how to fund [it]? [It needs] [b]udget for councils from central government to do [it].” Others suggested it “need[s] incentive[s] for councils to do it”;    Information – some said we would “need clear information on what [we] can recycle”, that it needs to happen “plus public awareness”, or that it is “dependent on 3f [product labelling and information campaigns”;    What is recycled and making it work for everyone – some said that “councils should recycle even what households can’t be bothered to do.” Others stated that it “need[s] to account for people with medical issues and medical waste”;    Who benefits – some specified that “benefits need to go to [the] local area.”  Grants and incentives for business This policy option would involve government providing grants to businesses to:   Improve recycling (e.g. for batteries, steel);    Develop new materials (e.g. alternatives to cement);    Make goods from recycled materials; and/or    Use more efficient production methods.  It could also include financial support for businesses wanting to move away from manufacturing to providing more sharing services, such as repairs or rentals. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about grants and incentives for business.  Pros + Supports businesses – some liked that it “provides support for business” or makes it “easier for business.” Others said it would be “popular for business as [it’s a] safe option.” + Encourages positive behaviour and ideas – some assembly members said the “reduced risks would encourage people to recycle.” Others felt it would “encourage businesses to come up with new ideas for reducing emissions” or “motivat[e] businesses to come up with innovations.” Some liked the idea of “grants for business to improve recycling.” Others said it’s an “incentive [to] pair with requirements in order to make it a ‘better pill to swallow’ therefore firms are more likely to go along with it.” + “Business need to play their part”  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  349  Cons − Not guaranteed to achieve what we want – some assembly members felt change was “not guaranteed” or that there is “no guarantee that this would effectively lead to reduced emissions.” − “Will change as governments change” − “Can’t see benefit straight away (other options are more short term/quick)”  Some assembly members noted conditions that they would want to see in order to support this policy option, or that they felt would help its implementation:   Who receives the funds – some asked “why give businesses grants to develop new materials? Wouldn’t it be better to invest in universities instead (to do this research)??” Others agreed, saying “if it was grants to universities for research, would be easier to accept”;    Supporting set-up – some suggested “grants initially for set up e.g. first 2 years.”  Product labelling and information campaigns Product labelling would show more clearly and consistently which products and materials can be recycled. Labelling could be accompanied by information campaigns. These would encourage recycling and composting, and educate people about why they are important. They could also include information about which materials can be recycled. Assembly members identified the following pros and cons about product labelling and information campaigns.  Pros + Better labelling – some assembly members said that “labelling is … visual [and] effective for people to make greener decisions.” Others liked the idea of “more clear labelling for recycling” or “labelling (clear) to give information and choice.” + “Helps individuals choose and doesn’t restrict choice” + “Education increases general awareness of all we do, and its consequences” + “Tackles an existing problem and consumer confusion” + “Easy and doable” + “Small change but could be effective”  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  350  Cons − Impact – some assembly members described labelling and information as “light touch – how much difference is it actually going to make? Easy thing to do – probably won’t make a huge impact.”  Some assembly members noted conditions that they would want to see in order to support this policy option, or that they felt would help its implementation:   Standardised approach and matching colours – some suggested that we “need [a] national standardised approach to recycling, even international standards e.g. red packaging = red bin – match packing label to bin.” Others said it “needs national policy”, “needs a national approach rather than local councils having different approaches”, or the “same colour bins.” Some noted:  When we sat around the table: everyone had a different recycling coloured bin. With the “ best will in the world, it has to be made easier: we have [a] blue bin for recycling, green bin for general waste, brown for garden waste. Difficult for people to understand. A traffic light system would help. Costs a fortune though to change the bins. Stickers could be applied rather than changing the bins.”   Increased doorstep recycling – some said it is “dependent on [policy option] 3d [increased doorstep recycling].”    Virgin materials – some said it’s “important to consider [the] use of virgin materials as well as emissions.”  Vote results Assembly members voted by secret ballot on policy options around increasing recycling. There were two ballot papers. The first ballot paper asked assembly members how much they agreed or disagreed that each policy option should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. The second ballot paper asked them to rank the options in their order of preference. The votes from this second ballot paper were counted both in terms of first preference votes and via Borda count. A clear majority of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that four of the policy ideas should be part of how the UK gets to net zero:   Product labelling and information campaigns – 92%;    Deposit return schemes – 86% (no assembly members disagreed with this idea);    Increased doorstep recycling – 85%;    Grants and incentives for business – 77%.  Only a minority of assembly members supported ‘recycling requirements (46%, compared to 40% who ‘strongly disagreed’ or ‘disagreed’) or ‘pay-as-you-throw schemes’ (28%, compared to 49% who ‘strongly disagreed’ or ‘disagreed’).

Policy options – conclusions Assembly members showed strong support for a wide range of measures to:   Reduce emissions from products and services;    Encourage people to buy less;    Increase recycling.  They were also clear about what they did not support. In total, clear majorities of assembly members backed thirteen policy measures.  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  353  % assembly members who ‘strongly agree’ or ‘agree’  Policy idea  Aim  Labelling and information about the carbon emissions caused by different products and services  Reducing emissions from products and services  92%  Product labelling and information campaigns about what can be recycled and why it’s important  Increasing recycling  92%  Resource efficiency targets and standards  Reducing emissions from products and services  91%  Deposit return schemes  Increasing recycling  86%  Increased doorstep recycling  Increasing recycling  85%  Amended procedure for awarding government contracts that gives preference to low carbon companies and products  Reducing emissions from products and services  83%  Taxes on producers, products and services  Reducing emissions from products and services  83%15  Buying less Extended producer responsibility  Reducing emissions from products and services  79%15  Buying less Grants and incentives for business  Increasing recycling  77%  Measures to enable product sharing  Buying less  77%  Advertising bans and restrictions  Buying less  74%  Assembly members noted a wide range of positives about these ideas. They saw benefits in measures that are proven or that they felt would make a difference. They also favoured simplicity and practicality; policies that retain individual choice and help make it more informed; and co-benefits such as increasing competition or improving product quality. Some assembly members noted conditions to their support for these policies or points that they felt would help implementation of the ideas. These included a need to take account of imports, ring-fence any tax revenue generated, and protect consumers from increased costs. Other recurring themes were issues around trust and compliance relating to business; some assembly members stressed the need for transparency, honesty, and reliable / independent information and schemes. They also advocated strong enforcement.  15  Assembly members considered ‘taxes on producers, products and services’ and ‘extended producer responsibility’ twice. This is because they are ways both to reduce emissions from products and services, and to encourage people to buy less. The scores shown for these policy options are the average across both votes. ‘Taxes on producers, products and services’ scored 83% of both occasions. ‘Extended producer responsibility’ was slightly more popular as a way to reduce emissions (83%) then as a way to encourage people to buy less (74%).  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  354  Assembly members did not back voluntary agreements, changes to income tax or working hours, personal carbon allowances, recycling requirements or pay-as-you-throw schemes. Their concerns included that measures would be ineffective or impractical, that they would penalise the less well-off, or that they would have unwanted side-effects such as an increase in fly-tipping.  D. Anything else to tell government and Parliament At the end of weekend three, assembly members had the opportunity to add any further thoughts on ‘what we buy’ and the path to net zero:   Imports and displacing emissions – some assembly members said that “we should include imports in net zero” or that “how we deal with imports absolutely should be considered and included by Parliament and government.” Others said that “we shouldn’t ‘displace’ our emissions to others and/or absolve ourselves of what is – at least in part – our problem.”    Global leadership – some assembly members stated that “we should be environmentally / climate responsible in terms of our global trading and deals with other countries – we should lead by example.”    Just Transition – some assembly members noted a need to “learn the lesson form the closing of the mining industry i.e. don’t abandon communities”, or said we should “be proactive to put things in place ahead of the transition to help and support people and communities and encourage new industries.” Others stated that we need “to support people who will lose their jobs in the oil and gas sector (e.g. retrained).” Some suggested “ring-fenc[ing] the taxes on oil and gas as a way to contribute to a transition fund.”  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  355    Renewable energy and fossil fuels subsidies – some assembly members said that “government shouldn’t be deterred by the lobbying of fossil fuel advocates, but should lead the strategy towards more renewable energy alternatives and the employment opportunities therein.” Others said they “need to understand why there’s a fossil fuel subsidy”, talked about “tax breaks given to oil and gas companies” or asked “how much are the current fossil fuel subsidies?”    Plastics – some assembly members said they were “concerned about making sure [the] plastic question is raised to Parliament.”    Recycling of old appliances – some assembly members said people “need more incentives to recycle their old appliances. Some things you can’t repair: that’s where businesses have to think about the future. Could be made easier to do: incentivise businesses to do that.”    Waste – one assembly member suggested that we should “stop needless waste by building contractors, retailers etc to prevent over-ordering, over-stocking etc.”    Education and information – some assembly members emphasised the need for education and information suggesting that “if people don’t understand what they are buying, they will be led by advertising.”    Long-term, cross-party commitment backed by a permanent citizens’ assembly – some assembly members emphasised the need for cross-party commitment a permanent citizens’ assembly, including making suggestions about the assembly’s membership:  Long-term commitment from government. Policy should be set out as cross-party. “ Worry that [a] new government coming in will change things.” Feel very strongly about government and Parliament’s commitment, whoever the “ party is: a permanent citizens’ assembly to oversee and hold them to account on the work done is essential.” Permanent citizens’ assembly: good thing because the assembly will be picked amongst “ citizens to monitor the implementation of the policies.” Need a continuation of the citizens’ assembly to monitor the plans taken by whoever “ takes charge of climate change: communication and co-ordination are key.” We need new people. A good mix of people. It can’t be the same people as the “ current assembly.”  “ Might be good to get a fresh pair of eyes. Fresh opinions. People’s availability will be key.” Would it get too political? People would have a political agenda: there should be more “ young people on [the assembly]. People in their early 20s and teenagers: the next 30 years are not going to affect my generation, but it will affect younger people. Young people should have more of a say. The younger the person is, the least likely they are to have political affiliations: new way of looking at things. Young people have got really good ideas: look at things completely differently. Who would choose is on the citizens’ assembly? Could easily become political.”  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  356  Conclusions Throughout their discussions, assembly members expressed consistent views on how ‘what we buy’ should change to help the UK reach net zero by 2050. Their recommendations entail changes for businesses in particular, but also for individuals. They envisaged a future with five key elements:   Assembly members strongly supported a future in which businesses make products using less – and lower carbon – energy and materials. They backed a range of specific policies to support this aim, including ‘resource efficiency targets and standards’ (91%), an ‘amended procedure for awarding government contracts that gives preference to low carbon companies and products’ (83%), ‘taxes on producers, products and services’ (83%), and ‘extended producer responsibility’ (79%).    Assembly members supported the idea of individuals repairing and sharing more, with less purchasing of new products. They backed ‘measures to enable product sharing’ (77%) including technical and financial support to businesses who offer sharing or renting services.    Assembly members’ felt strongly about the need for better information to promote informed choice and changes in individual behaviour. They supported ‘labelling and information about the carbon emissions caused by different products and services’ (92%) and ‘product labelling and information campaigns about what can be recycled and why it’s important’ (92%). They also backed ‘advertising bans and restrictions’ on high emissions products or sectors (74%).    Assembly members supported a range of measures aimed at increasing recycling by individuals and businesses, including ‘deposit return schemes’ (86%), ‘increased doorstep recycling’ (85%), and ‘grants and incentives for businesses’ to improve recycling, develop new materials and make goods from recycled materials (77%). Their preferred future included businesses doing more to turn old products into new ones.    Assembly members called for long-term commitment from government and Parliament. They emphasised the importance of cross-party support to prevent policies changing when governments change, as well as the need to look at both quick wins and long-term solutions.  Some assembly members raised additional points for government and Parliament to consider around a need to take account of imports, ring-fence any tax revenue generated by the above policies, and protect consumers from increased costs. Some also highlighted trust and compliance issues relating to business, asking for transparency, honesty, strong enforcement, and reliable / independent information and schemes. Assembly members welcomed measures that would create additional job opportunities, and stressed the need for a Just Transition for people and sectors adversely affected by the path to net zero. Assembly members were equally clear about what they did not support. Assembly members did not back voluntary agreements, changes to income tax or working hours, personal carbon allowances, recycling requirements or pay-as-you-throw schemes. Their concerns included that measures would be ineffective or impractical, that they would penalise the less well-off, or that they would have unwanted side-effects such as an increase in fly-tipping.  Climate Assembly UK ― What we buy  357  8  ha pt er  Where our electricity comes from  C  Summary of recommendations 1 Large majorities of assembly members strongly agreed or agreed that three ways of generating electricity should be part of how the UK gets to net zero:   Offshore wind (95%);    Solar power (81%);    Onshore wind (78%).  2 Assembly members tended to see these technologies as proven, clean and low cost, with wind-based options suitable for a “windy” UK. Offshore wind had key additional benefits, particularly being “out of the way”. Solar power was viewed as flexible in terms of where it can be located, among other advantages. Some assembly members suggested a range of points to bear in mind when implementing all three technologies. These included their location and environmental impact, progress on electricity storage, ways to incentivise and facilitate uptake, visual design, and where they are manufactured. 3 Assembly members were much less supportive of bioenergy, nuclear and fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage – although, particularly for bioenergy, significant numbers of assembly members were unsure about its use:   40% of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that bioenergy should be part of how the UK gets to net zero, 36% were ‘unsure’, and 24% ‘strongly disagreed’ or ‘disagreed’;    The equivalent figures for nuclear were 34%, 18% and 46%;    For fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage the results were 22%, 22% and 56%.  4 For some assembly members, their view on bioenergy would depend on how bioenergy is produced, including what is being burnt, how production is regulated, and therefore what its environmental and CO2 impacts are. Assembly members’ dislikes about bioenergy included concerns around burning trees and crops, land use and environmental effects, as well as a feeling that better alternatives exist. 5 Assembly members’ had three main concerns around nuclear: its cost, safety, and issues around waste storage and decommissioning. Their dislikes of fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage centred on safety risks (if carbon leaked during storage or transfer), the continued use of fossil fuels, and a feeling that it only provides a “short-term”, expensive solution when better alternatives are available. 6 Assembly members did not hear detailed evidence about tidal, wave, hydro and geothermal technologies. However assembly members were in principle supportive of the use of these final four ways of generating electricity, particularly for suitable local areas.  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  359  Where our electricity comes from How the UK generates its electricity is a central question on the path to net zero. The UK still produces a significant amount of its electricity from fossil fuels, particularly gas. This emits carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming and climate change. All the UK’s electricity generation will need to come from low carbon sources if its net zero target is to be met. The UK is also likely to need more electricity in future due to an increase in electric vehicles and electric heating.  What did the assembly consider? All assembly members heard evidence, deliberated and voted on this topic. They heard about six main ways of generating electricity, before considering whether or not each of them should be part of how the UK gets to net zero:   Onshore wind    Offshore wind    Solar    Bioenergy    Nuclear    Fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage  The evidence session for this theme took place during the assembly’s online weekends.1 It covered:  1  The assembly also heard introductory evidence on this topic at the start of weekend two. This ensured assembly members were aware of key issues about where our electricity comes from, before discussing related themes such as surface transport and heating our homes. The subject of hydrogen was touched on during this weekend two introductory session and is picked up in comments from some assembly members in this chapter. Similarly, assembly members who looked at air travel heard evidence on synthetic fuels during weekend two, another area touched on by some assembly members during this chapter.  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  360    What each of the above six generation methods are and different views on their desirability;    The design of the electricity system and how it may need to change;2    Some limited evidence on generating electricity using hydro, tidal, wave and geothermal technologies.3 Assembly members were able to express their views on these methods in their discussions and on their ballot papers, albeit in a more limited way than for the six ways of generating electricity listed above.  Assembly members had the opportunity to question each speaker4 in detail. After the evidence session, assembly members discussed what they had heard. They then voted by secret ballot.  What’s included in this chapter? Assembly members had less time overall to discuss ‘where our electricity comes from’ than they had had for the themes covered in previous chapters. They therefore primarily focussed on just one question: which of the above six ways of generating electricity should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. Assembly members looked at this question in some depth. This chapter presents their views in the following order: A.  Vote results: the assembly’s final recommendations on which of the six ways of generating electricity should be part of how the UK gets to net zero;  B.  Rationale and conditions: assembly members’ rationale for their votes, as well as areas they would like to see considered around the implementation of each of the six options;  C.  Other technologies: assembly members’ views on the technologies that they heard less evidence about – hydro, tidal, wave and geothermal;  D.  Cross-cutting considerations: points raised by assembly members that cut across all the ways of generating electricity.  The chapter ends by summarising the conclusions from across these sections.  2 3 4  This included information about measures needed to ensure that the supply and use of electricity are balanced in real time – including storage (e.g. via batteries) and interconnectors (cables to other countries). The assembly did not have sufficient time to look at every way of generating electricity. It therefore focussed mainly on the technologies with most potential to generate a substantial amount of low carbon electricity in a cost effective way. The assembly heard from three speakers on where our electricity comes from: Mike Hemsley, Committee on Climate Change (informant); Professor Patricia Thornley, Aston University (informant); Professor Jim Watson, University College London (informant). All speakers’ presentations are available as slides, videos and transcripts at climateassembly.uk/resources/. An ‘informant’ is a speaker who we asked to cover the range of views and available evidence on a topic.  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  361  Contents of this chapter A.

There were two different ballot papers. The first ballot paper asked assembly members how much they agreed or disagreed that each method should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. The second ballot paper asked them to rank the methods in their order of preference. The votes from this second ballot paper were counted in two ways:   Counting assembly members’ first preference votes only.    Using Borda count. This involves allocating points for preferences – a first preference vote scored five points, a second preference vote four points and so on. A sixth preference vote scored no points. Counting the votes like this tells us which methods are most acceptable to the greatest number of assembly members. This is particularly useful for this question, as it is likely that more than one way of generating electricity will be needed.  A majority of assembly members strongly agreed or agreed that three ways of generating electricity should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. In their order of preference these were:   Offshore wind (95% of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’, with a large majority of 80% ‘strongly agreeing’; no assembly members ‘strongly disagreed’ or ‘disagreed’);    Solar power (81% ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’, with 51% ‘strongly agreeing’);    Onshore wind (78% ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’, with 44% ‘strongly agreeing’).

Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  363  The other three methods saw much lower levels of support, and higher degrees of both uncertainty and disagreement. In assembly members’ order of preference:   40% of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that bioenergy should be part of how the UK gets to net zero, 36% were ‘unsure’, and 24% ‘strongly disagreed’ or ‘disagreed’;    The equivalent figures for nuclear were 34%, 18% and 46%;    For fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage the results were 22%, 22% and 56%; a majority of assembly members ‘disagreed’ or ‘strongly disagreed’ that this way of generating electricity should be part of how the UK gets to net zero.  The results of the preference votes largely reinforce this picture. A majority of assembly members (65%) chose offshore wind as their first preference method, with all other options a long way behind. In the Borda count, offshore wind, onshore wind and solar were again more popular than the other methods – with onshore wind scoring slightly more highly than solar power in this vote. Assembly members’ order of preference for the other methods was again bioenergy, followed by nuclear, with fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage bringing up the rear.

Rationale and conditions This section contains:   The reasons that sit behind assembly members’ votes, as just reported;    ‘Conditions’ that some assembly members felt would support the use of each technology or that they suggested should be in place for it to be used.  Given the detailed nature of assembly members’ comments, we have categorised the pros and cons for each of way of generating electricity under six headings:   Environment impact and land use    Practicality, efficiency, readiness and scale    Costs, the economy and jobs    Public support    Safety and risk    Other  The category titles are our words, not assembly members’, and are just there to make assembly members’ thoughts easier to navigate. All the content under the headings is assembly members’ own.  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  365  We have kept in contradictory opinions in order to show the full range of views amongst assembly members. The results of the votes above tell you what conclusions assembly members reached having considered all these points, and the weight of feeling in support (or not) of each way of generating electricity.  B.1 Onshore wind Onshore wind means wind turbines that are located on land. Assembly members discussed this technology in small groups, noting pros and cons.  Pros Assembly members identified the following areas as points that they liked about onshore wind.  Environmental impacts and land use Some assembly members liked that onshore wind is “sustainable”, “renewable,” “doesn’t run out” and is “environmentally friendly.” Others described it as “clean energy”, “cleaner”, “low carbon” and “not dirty (i.e. does not use fossil fuels).” Some said they liked that “no CO2 [is] produced (except in construction)” or that it is a “non-polluting operation.” Some assembly members labelled onshore wind “a natural way of …[generating] electricity” or noted that it “uses natural resources to produce energy.” Some highlighted that there is “no waste”, “no nuclear waste” or “no residue at the end.” A number of assembly members commented on wind turbines’ appearance, expressing a range of views. Some were positive commenting that they are “majestic”, “pretty in the right location”, “pleasant to look at on the horizon” or that they like “seeing wind turbines…[and] think they look nice, even the modern ones.” Others were more muted suggesting that “some don’t mind the look of them”, or that “turbines are more attractive than slag heaps.” Some noted that “one or two turbines can be built on their own (i.e. in industrial areas)” and that these “are not huge farms, so that makes them quite attractive.” Others commented “houses aren’t attractive in the environment so why do we have a problem with wind turbines?” Some assembly members presented a different view, saying “they are an eye sore, but if the potential is there this outweighs the negatives…. Other things are eye sores (e.g. power stations, masts), we have had to get used to them, we’ll get used to this.” Some assembly members talked about benefits for future generations. Comments included that “we are all responsible for what happens to the world, and this is one solution.” Others noted a “lack of [negative] impact for future generations” or that “they are temporary and when they are done the landscape returns and the impact is gone.” One assembly member said “if placed where it’s effective, you can have dual land use.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  366  Practicality, efficiency, readiness and scale Some assembly members said that onshore wind is a “proven technology, it works, we have it already up and running.” Some suggested that “no testing [is] needed” and “we know if we build more it will be fine.” Others described it as a “very well researched tech …[which is] gaining traction as a well established technology”, is “available now” and “practical.” Some assembly members suggested that it is “easy to do – technically” and “easy to use,” including being “low maintenance,” “easy to fix and maintain” and “easy to set up.” Some commented that it is “easier (than off-shore) to maintain – to access and upgrade as technology improves.” A number of assembly highlighted the benefits of using onshore wind at a small scale and in strategic locations. Some assembly members suggested that “whilst ‘wind farms’ can be seen as a negative, for some farmers, having a single turbine to generate power can be vital.” Others said that “there may be an opportunity to extend use beyond feeding into the grid to power specific factories or other sites” or that it “works on [a] smaller scale / homes as well as [a] larger scale.” Some suggested that “there would be [an] opportunity to expand production in strategic locations to minimise energy lost in transmission.” Some assembly members said it is “scalable – 10 x more potential than currently so can produce lots of energy.” Others noted that it can be done “at a large scale” or suggested that there is the “ability to produce a large amount of energy (even if storage [is] currently problematic).” Some assembly members commented that “it’s an existing technology so can be more easily scaled up.” Some assembly members noted that “we are an island so there is always wind” or suggested that this is a “good source of energy for the UK.” One assembly member pointed out that it “can still be windy at night, unlike [the sun and] solar energy.” Other individual assembly members suggested that “you can store the energy in batteries”, that “power can be moved easily” or that there’s the “ability to build on existing infrastructure.” One assembly member felt that it “could be used with geothermal well.”  Costs, the economy and jobs A sizeable number of assembly members described onshore wind as “low cost”, “cheap”, or “cheaper”, with some suggesting specifically that it is “cheaper than off-shore to build, maintain and (mostly) to transmit the energy.” Some labelled it “cost effective,” suggesting that “production is virtually free once its built – represents good value.” Some said that “costs are coming down” and that because of “economies of scale…[it] will only get cheaper.” Others suggested that it is “becoming much more attractive for companies to build.” Some assembly members described it as “free energy.” Others said “we should be exploiting free energy, and it will be available for generations.” Some assembly members felt onshore wind would have benefits for the economy and jobs. They suggested it would be “economically good as [turbines] create a lot of on-going engineering jobs” or that “there could be a positive impact on industry in manufacturing them.” Others said more generally that “we could exploit the opportunities of this technology as a country.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  367  Some assembly talked about the potential to make and raise money. Some members suggested that there is a “possibility to make money as individuals from it”, while others felt they are a “good investment for energy companies as [they] can have confidence.” Some noted the “benefits from wind farms giving donations to local causes.”  Public support Some assembly members wondered whether public hostility had been “over-hyped” or was being “given too much attention”: “We were informed the Government stopped awarding contracts in 2015, when 80% of the public thought onshore wind was acceptable. Would public opinion have changed since then; would more people find it acceptable?” More than one assembly member talked about a “local example of [a] wind farm near where I live – after initial resistance, people have accepted it.” In one case they said this was because people ”can see land is being used well (wasn’t useful for much else, not fertile, etc.).” Some assembly members felt that “people are used to wind turbines so not so difficult to introduce” or suggested that concerns about public acceptability “should not be allowed to overly influence decision-making.” Some assembly members said that onshore wind turbines may not be people’s choice but they are “what people need.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  368  Some assembly members suggested that people being able to see wind turbines is positive; some commented that “when located in towns, it’s good to make people realise where the energy comes from” or that “you can see it producing our energy and that there are no emissions.” One assembly member suggested it’s “quiet.”  Safety and risk One assembly member said onshore wind is “safer compared to offshore wind.”  Other Some assembly members said that onshore wind has “very few negatives” or that “there are lots in my area – I have no problem with them. There’s nothing to dislike about them.” Other assembly members also expressed general support, saying they “like the idea of onshore wind”, that it is “good and productive” or it’s “good to see lots of it happening.” One assembly member suggested that “everyone benefits” from its use.  Cons Assembly members identified the following areas as points that they disliked about onshore wind.  Environment impacts and land use A sizeable number of assembly members expressed concerns about land use. They noted that turbines “take land that could be used for something else” or suggested that they are “probably not the best use of land, we’re a very populated nation.” Others felt that it would “hinder farming and food producers” or that the land “might be better used for growing local produce”, for “housing”, or “for trees.” Some said that “there is room for onshore wind (land space available to increase the number of turbines) but not endlessly,” while others felt we “would need lots of them for it to be worthwhile – need them to take up huge amounts of land.” Some assembly members said that “there is lots of demand for land use in some parts of the UK we may not be able to find appropriate sites.” The sizeable number of assembly members who commented on wind turbines’ appearance had a range of views. Some disliked the “visual impact” or “local visual impact”, saying that turbines “don’t look nice”, ruin the landscape, and are “ugly”, an “intrusion”, an “eyesore” or “spoil the view and nature.” Some said they were “particularly concerned [about the] impact on areas of natural beauty, such as mountains.” Others described them as “not scenic” and suggested that they “need to be sited away from the beaten track/somewhere it doesn’t look awful.” Some lamented the fact you “would see it when you are walking about” or “wonder[ed]  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  369  what they will look like in 2050: will they be rusty and unclean?” Others’ dislike was slightly more muted, with some assembly members suggesting that the “visual is a concern, but not too much, as benefits outweigh the negatives” or that they’re “not good for resident’s views, but [it’s] just one of those things – a chance you take if you live in the countryside.” Some said they didn’t like the “visual impact…but not that bad.” Others said “they are ugly” but that “this might improve as the technology improves.” Some assembly members voiced concerns about “negative impact on wildlife” or the “impact on migrating birds,” with some asking “what about endangered species, peatland, birds.” Others mentioned “bird strikes, bats” whilst noting we’re “glad they are taking steps to try to reduce the impact on birds.” Some assembly members noted concerns about habitat loss or “environmental impact” more generally, with some picking out hedgerows and peatland as particular areas of concern. Others said turbines “destroy natural habitat” or suggested that “the ‘changed’ wind that comes off the turbines can be damaging to landscapes and eco-systems.” Some queried whether there are “additional risks of damage to land used in this way, eg flooding or erosion?” Others said that “there could be an impact of manufacturing on the environment (especially if imported).” Some assembly members talked about “concrete bases”, “non-recyclable materials” and “cradle to grave impact – consider where they are sited and impact – e.g peatlands, road building – need to assess lifetime cost.”  Practicality, efficiency, readiness and scale Some assembly members disliked that wind turbines are a “variable source of energy”, labelling them “unreliable if wind not blowing”, or saying they are “intermittent”, “unpredictable” or that you “can’t rely on wind for electricity.” Some suggested that a wind farm located on the West coast “might not produce its full capacity. Do you want to take up all that land space for 85 000 wind turbines?” Some assembly members said that “on days where there’s too much [electricity] produced, [we] haven’t got the facilities to store it at the moment”, with others simply noting “can’t store it.” Some felt this meant we “should use it to generate synthetic fuel from CO2 in [the] atmosphere – in this way [we] don’t need batteries or H2. Synthetic fuel has longer lasting utility than batteries and H2 needs new infrastructure.” Some assembly members commented of the location of wind turbines: “Windfarms need to be close to where the energy is used to be more effective. But we see lots of them far away from cities. The more the energy travels, the more you lose in the transfer, so that’s a problem.” Others noted that the “best places to locate the turbines might not be the places where the most energy is needed, therefore transmission costs and losses increase.” Some worried that turbines might be located “in places that might not continue to supply the energy to us (i.e. Scotland if they get independence).”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  370  Some assembly members commented on efficiency and capacity. Some suggested that onshore turbines are “less efficient than offshore” or that they “produce small amounts of energy compared to their claims.” Others suggested that the “tech could be improved if made smaller – there’s inertia with the bigger turbines needing more wind.” One assembly member noted “I have a local windfarm and power generation is listed in energy by household (it produces energy for 1000 homes) which is nothing compared to the amount of houses in the area.”  Cost, the economy, and jobs Some assembly members said they disliked the “cost” or “costs of manufacture.” Others said that the “price for electricity generated should be lower” or that there was “some suggestion that maintenance costs are high.” One assembly member disliked that “many [turbines] are made abroad”, although another countered that “there is a lot of production in Hull.”  Public support Some assembly members said that they “can result in local controversy” particularly because of the visual impact and suggested that “local communities should be more involved in deciding whether they are located near them or not – who makes the decisions.” Others said “public acceptability is a limitation” and they are “not seen as popular with the public”, with some noting “personally, I don’t dislike them, but I understand that others don’t want them in their area.” Some assembly members raised issues about living close to wind turbines. Some noted that “living close to them means you get reflections from them like mirrors” or that they “can be distracting to look at at times – maybe better away from roads.” Others said there is “noise if close but not that bad” or “noisy – but you do get used to it.” Some felt the “noise impact” and “noise pollution” were more serious particularly if “scaled up”: “a friend lives close to a windfarm and it makes their life miserable. Constant humming sound which can drive you bonkers.” Others said that “delivery of the turbines…[is] unsuitable for small roads – disruptive.”  Safety and risk Some assembly members said onshore wind turbines are “not capable of handling strong winds” or “can be damaged by high winds so need to be turned off above a certain wind speed.” Others asked “can blades be dangerous if they come off?”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  371  Other Some assembly members worried that turbines are “unfair on rural communities who have them while urban dwellers benefit.” Others said they were “concerned about the development of large-scale wind farms in Scotland, which benefit England…, but have a negative impact on the Scottish environment and landscape.” Some assembly members said onshore wind “is not as good an option as building off-shore.”  Conditions Some assembly members noted conditions that they would want to be in place for onshore to be used, or that they felt would help its use. They highlighted a need to:  Think carefully about location Some assembly members felt that “they have a place, but should not be located everywhere.” What constituted a suitable or unsuitable place was different for different assembly members, for example: “As long as it’s in the right areas, so not on natural beauty areas, but better on useless land.” “Use land that cannot be used for other things e.g. agriculture.” “Onshore wind can also be built on marginal land without much other use, and can be integrated with other solutions for reducing our emissions (such as new forests) or placed next to other construction projects so the land required for onshore wind can be reduced even while it is massively scaled up.” “As long as not outside your house.” “…they need to be dispersed…. Don’t have to be huge farms.” “There is plenty of sparsely populated land (e.g. in Northern Ireland) where you could site turbines.” “Put out of the way, e.g. motorways.” “Need to be placed in best places to ensure UK has access to the energy.” “Focus where maximum benefit and least damage.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  372  Look at small scale uses and better visual design Some assembly members stated a “preference for personal, small scale” as opposed to “large developments”, while others suggested that there “would need to be measures put in place to minimise the size of on-land turbines as technology develops (i.e. not as big as off-shore ones)” or suggested “more focu[s] on the models without sails that have less visual impact on the landscape.” Some noted that they “don’t seem to have variations in the design – could it be miniaturised (i.e. on aircrafts don’t have massive blades).” Some suggested that factories could “have their own windfarms to power their plants? e.g. Nissan plant has its own windfarm.” Others asked whether they could “have these on our personal homes, i.e. wind trees?” or said “we could consider the use of household wind trees (aeroleaves) for household power generation. They are small and can work at low wind speeds.”  Tackle public acceptability Some assembly members felt there would be a “need to change public perception” and made suggestions about how to win round the public. “If the public knew wind turbines are a low cost option, they might become more acceptable.” “If they were all over the place and people could see the cost benefit analysis that might help.”  Consider land use Some assembly members said that their support would “depend on how the land is used, i.e. farm around [them]” or suggested that you could “use the land for two different things” or that the UK should be “combining onshore wind turbines with other things e.g. tree cover.”  Make them in the UK Some said they would be ”in favour if they were made in [the] UK – better for local jobs”.  Sort out storage and infrastructure Some assembly members said that “battery storage needs to be good and with infrastructure to support this.” Others said we “need the infrastructure to get the energy to the grid and avoid wasted energy (sometimes more is available than can be used)”. Some asked how we plan to dispose of the batteries.  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  373  Manage impact Some assembly members suggested that “commercial businesses need to be managed to ensure that they don’t damage the landscape” or that onshore wind needs “needs proper assessment of environmental impact.”  Reinstate grants Some assembly members said that “grants from government were stopped and need to be renewed” or that “Government support pulled for them and it needs to come back to then lower cost and give support for renewables.”  Ensure security Some assembly members suggested that we need to “protect against foreign ownership/ outsourcing to ensure supply and protections.”  Relax planning rules Some assembly members suggested that “[l]ocal authorities need to be more flexible with regulations and rules relaxed.”  As seen in Section A, assembly members expressed significant support for onshore wind in their votes.  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  374  B.2 Offshore wind Offshore wind means wind turbines that are located at sea. Assembly members discussed this technology in small groups, noting pros and cons.  Pros Assembly members identified the following areas as points that they liked about offshore wind.  Environment impacts and land use A significant number of assembly members commented that offshore turbines are “out of the way”, “can go a long way out in the ocean” or are “out of sight, out of mind”. Some assembly members suggested this had visual benefits in not “spoiling the landscape”, with some saying you “don’t have unsightly turbines on the land” or that you “get the benefits of onshore turbines without the disruption of [the] natural landscape.” One said “this is the proper place for wind turbines” while another noted the “aesthetic – visually nicer and appealing [than alternatives].” Other assembly members suggested offshore wind “affects fewer people than onshore”, is “further away from people’s houses”, or “doesn’t intrude in any way– away from people so no one will have issues with noise etc”. Others said they are “not in people’s back gardens / in the countryside.” Some assembly members suggested that there would be “minimal disruption to wildlife”, only “[l]ow impact (on the environment)” or that this the technology that is “least disruptive to nature.” Some assembly members expanded on this theme stating: “Despite some disruption to marine habitats during construction they could actually help preserve marine life by creating ‘safe haven’ areas eg no fishing, no shipping.” “Overall good for environment – may have disturbed marine life when built, but then keep ships away once installed. Mussels grow on the base etc.” Some assembly members described offshore wind as “clean”, “healthy,” “green energy”, “renewable”, or an “unlimited source of energy.” Others said it creates “no pollution” and does not produce CO2. Some assembly members suggested offshore wind is a “better use of our resources…which in turn frees up the land.” Others felt it “saves the land for other uses” or that the “land management issues associated with onshore are gone.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  375  Practicality, efficiency, readiness and scale Some assembly members said that there is “more space at sea”, “lots of space around our coastline” or that we’ve “got lots of water [to put them in].” Others suggested that we “could power the whole country by using just a small percentage of the seabed”, that it would be “easy to increase numbers” or that it “can be scaled up massively.” Some assembly members said offshore wind produces a “great amount of power”, has “more potential than [we] realised,” or has the “capacity to provide a lot of electricity – e.g. Woley Windfarm generates enough electricity for 600,000 homes.” Some suggested that it “could meet most of … demand, it can play a big part, just need something for reliability when no wind.” Others said turbines are “able to be a lot larger [at sea] and produce more electricity” or that offshore turbines are “more efficient” than onshore ones. Some assembly members suggested that “offshore ones [turbines] are a lot a bigger. …[fewer] offshore produce the same amount of energy…. Means that we want to put more offshore – and reduce the onshore.” Some assembly members commented that we “already use it, know it works” or that it is “reliable” or “more reliable than other technologies.” Individual assembly members suggested that it could be “a good long term solution”, is “manageable” or that “we have the technology to potentially install in [a] less disruptive way e.g. oil platforms.” Some assembly members felt we should “use a resource we have plenty of – wind!” while others said there are “stronger winds at sea” or “always wind at sea”. Some liked the fact “they are floatable” with some noting that “they can be moved to where the wind is (we understand that some are on platforms and can be towed).”  Cost, the economy, and jobs Some assembly members felt that offshore wind could “create a lot of jobs”, including “well paid high skilled maintenance jobs” or jobs in “making them/ installing etc.” Some suggested that there would be “job opportunities for people formerly working on oil and gas platforms in [the] north, [meaning a] negative becomes a positive, transition of the industry.” Similarly, some noted that “we have many seaside towns supporting the oil industry and so can repurpose these which is good for jobs / economy.” Others suggested we “can start exporting once its built” or that it has “export potential.” Some assembly members said offshore wind is “cheap, and getting cheaper to install” or is “cheaper than fossil fuels.” Others suggested that “strategically sited they could reduce transmission costs as very few parts of the country are very far from a coastline.”  Public support One assembly member commented that “people are used to them.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  376  Safety and risk No assembly members made comments in this area.  Other Some assembly members said offshore wind has “no major negative”, has “very, very few disadvantages”, or has “fewer disadvantages (than onshore wind).” Some labelled it the “best option by miles” and a “brilliant idea”, saying “I’m all for it.” One assembly member commented that “we are doing it a lot in the South East of England. It is a variable source and best to generate electricity. All positive.”  Cons Assembly members identified the following areas as points that they disliked about offshore wind.  Environment impacts and land use Some assembly members disliked the visual impact of offshore wind, saying it is “intrusive” or an “eye sore” and noting you “can see [them] from the land.” A few members made comments about one particular wind farm: “It can still be an eye sore offshore (e.g. just been built off [the] beach in Aberdeen), it’s a massive change but you get used to it, it’s not a huge problem for me but can see an issue for others.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  377  “Donald Trump tried to stop them – he was the only one who complained! The problem was the views from his golf course. Locals didn’t mind that.” “Trump didn’t like it in Aberdeen. Complained to the Local Council. Did go ahead despite taking the Council to Court.” Some assembly members were concerned about the impact on “marine animals”, “sea creatures”, “sea life”, “migratory birds” and of “drilling into the sea bed.” Some noted particular concerns about the “cables and where they come onshore and impact on things like sand,” or the “construction phase…but also possibly … the wind currents they produce.” Some assembly members suggested that the “impact isn’t well tested/understood” or that we “might want to see more assessment of that damage.” Other assembly members caveated their concerns, for example: “Going to have some impact on marine diversity but ‘you can’t make an omelette without breaking eggs.’” “Concern about affecting marine life (but like what was said about initial disturbance but overall good for marine life).” “Potential impact on birds (but of limited concern because if sited off migration routes should have limited significant impact).” “There are minimal ecological impacts. The wildlife comes back in 20 years. Not a huge downside for me.” Some assembly members highlighted issues around pollution and ethics, noting the “use of heavy metals in the development of the batteries [for storing electricity]” and asking “how can we ethically build them.” Some assembly members highlighted “mining/metals and minerals and the negative impacts they create in building the turbines – local energy better.” Some assembly members felt there is a “high pollution risk, which is harder to control offshore than onshore.” Individual assembly members said they “worry about drilling underground” or had concerns about the “human impact on people that live nearby, but research is needed.”  Practicality, efficiency, readiness and scale Some assembly members felt that offshore turbines are “harder to maintain” or “difficul[t] to build”, noting issues with “accessibility to install and maintain. ” Some assembly members suggested that “you need big infrastructure to get out and maintain them.” Others said that “increased maintenance costs…[are] not just because of [the] location but also because of the harsher environment.” Some assembly members questioned turbines’ durability, asking whether the turbines would be “affected by storms, eg strength of wind”, whether they are “safe, strong and durable” or whether the turbines will “last as long” as onshore turbines.  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  378  Another concern for some assembly members was intermittent supply and issues around storage. Some said it was “not guaranteed energy” or commented on the “unreliability of the wind”, suggesting that “with Britain’s changeable weather it won’t work all the time.” Others said it is “only efficient when windy currently – need to develop battery storage or share it with other countries.” Other assembly members mentioned “concern about the storage of electricity.” One assembly member highlighted “the amount of backup generation, spare capacity we have to build…”, suggesting “we need almost as much spare capacity as we need generating capacity, for when the wind drops. This needs to be also a green technology or we have to sacrifice ‘greenness’.” Some assembly members wondered if there would be “difficulty transporting electricity from offshore to where it’s needed?” or suggested there would be a “loss of power as it’s transferred.”  Cost, the economy, and jobs Some assembly members said there is a “big upfront cost which would take a long time to recoup [and] means people are reluctant to do it.” Others said there are “big expenses/costs associated with drilling into the seabed” or said they disliked the “cost to install and maintain, compared to onshore turbines.” Some assembly members highlighted “maintenance costs”: “if they go wrong would have to send a boat out specifically for that windmill. Would be quite expensive.” Others commented that we “would need a lot of them and therefore [it] would cost a lot.” Some assembly members said we “need to be careful we do not have too many...[i]mpacts on fishermen.” Some assembly members worried about “shipping routes” or “danger to shipping”. Others commented they were “worried about the adverse effect on shipping and fishing, but Chris [Stark] confirmed that [offshore wind] only uses 1% of space so now [we are] not worried.” One assembly member disliked “paying rent to the Queen (via the Crown Estate) – one of the richest people in the world.”  Public support No assembly members made comments in this area.  Safety and risk Some assembly members voiced concerns about “safety during installation and maintenance – similar conditions to offshore oil and gas industry which is dangerous.” Others said they “don’t know the downsides, not a deep sea diver, don’t know the risks of building offshore turbines” or asked more generally “[w]hat happens if something goes wrong?” Some assembly members said they were “concerned about security: vulnerability of the cable that brings the power to land being attacked.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  379  Conditions Assembly members also noted conditions that they would want to be in place for offshore wind to be used, or that they felt would help its use. They suggested a need to:  Consider environmental impacts Some assembly members suggested we “need to factor in [the] impact of this on [the] natural environment still” or said they “would like reassurance that this is being considered”, querying whether we “fully understand their environmental impact yet.” Others said we “must choose sites that don’t interrupt migration routes or breeding sites for marine/bird life” or that “siting must be properly assessed with regards to environmental impacts – birds etc.” One assembly member commented: “I…think offshore wind comes with its own environmental issues, such as habitat degradation of the sea bed. It affects bird populations, particularly juveniles. So, I do think it has to be implemented correctly and the effects to the natural world need to be strongly considered whenever sites are being selected.”  Resolve issues with storage Some assembly members said there needs to be “good research into energy storage” or that we “need storage or [an]other back-up solution.”  Put them out of sight Some assembly members asked to “keep them away from [the] coastal environment / resorts” or commented “why not put them all out of sight?”  Understand risks better Some assembly members said we “need to find out more about the risks associated with installing offshore turbines.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  380  Integrate offshore wind with other elements of the energy mix Comments included: “Need to integrate [offshore wind] with other elements of [the] energy mix – e.g. float barges making synthetic fuel by turbines, and then plug this into [the] existing fuel system which is better than having to build extensive cabling back to shore. Can also add in solar, wind and wave. By 2050 this would be cheaper.”  Promote UK construction and ownership Some assembly members said they “would like to see an emphasis on British construction and ownership to ensure they are making a wider contribution to the economy.”  Use floating turbines Some assembly members particularly liked the idea of floating turbines.  Individual assembly members said their support would “depend on [the] volume (of turbines) required”, that it “would be good to keep perfecting them, make them better and better” or that “there could be trade deals done with France & Ireland to share offshore wind energy consumption.” As seen in Section A, assembly members expressed very strong support for offshore wind in their votes.  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  381  B.3 Solar Solar refers to solar panels that are located on homes and other buildings, or at a larger scale on land (e.g. in fields). Assembly members discussed this technology in small groups, noting pros and cons.  Pros Assembly members identified the following areas as points that they liked about solar.  Environment impacts and land use Some assembly members said they liked that solar is a “natural source of energy” or that “we have what it uses already – sunlight!”, with some commenting that “it’s a good idea to use the sun.” Others described it as an “infinite supply of energy” or a “regular source of energy, especially as [it] doesn’t require full sun all the time, just light.” Some said that “the UK has significant periods of daylight everyday”, although they acknowledged differences between the north and south. Others suggested that “it’s reliable and will last.” Some assembly members said solar is “very clean” or a “clean form of energy.” Others said there is “[n]o pollution during energy production.” Some assembly members said that it’s “a simple method and a good use of land. I have experience of it and it’s great!”. Others suggested that you “can still use fields where solar panels are located – including for grazing. It allows a habitat to remain intact.” Some said solar is “environmentally friendly” or that there is “no impact on wildlife.” Some assembly members suggested that solar panels are “not an eyesore”, are “clean looking” or “look okay.” Others said that they are “less of an eyesore than turbines (particularly when located on buildings).” Some liked the fact solar is “silent” or “not in people’s way”, with some suggesting there is “no disruption to anyone.”  Practicality, efficiency, readiness and scale A sizeable number of assembly members said that they liked the fact that solar is flexible – that it “can be put anywhere” and used for many things: + Many places: assembly members talked about locations including “rooftops, fields, homes, businesses”, “buildings, land and sea”, “new buildings”, “older properties and buildings”, “public buildings”, and “cars”. Some noted that you can “use it in places we don’t usually use or usually waste, eg roofs, windows” and that it’s “good to make use of that space.” One assembly member said that “they are about to put solar farms onto [my] local park and ride scheme.” Another commented that “unlike onshore wind technology and the implication for space…, solar can make use of all the existing urban environment that we have got. Some assembly members said they had “heard of roof tiles being made of out of solar panels” or said that the “technology can be “applied diversely, eg in windows, and the tech is improving all the time.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  382  + Many uses: some assembly members said they could be used to “heat water” and “power homes.” Other assembly members asked “why can’t all roofs have solar panels” or suggested solar panels “could help if they were on everyone’s houses.” Some suggested that solar “can be done at scale” or is “scalable” because it “can be put anywhere.” Others liked the fact that it “could go up to 10% (of our electricity needs).” Some assembly members said that solar is proven – that it “is used a lot around the world already”, “works” or is a technology which is “established and well developed.” Others said it has “established efficiency.” Some described it as a “simple technology” that is “easy to develop both at large and small scale.” Others suggested that it is “easy to install and maintain and can be upgraded quite easily.” Some assembly members approved of the fact it “can be local to you” or is “located near homes…[so] no power loss.” Others suggested that a “localised direct supply… [would] remov[e] the need for transport.” Some assembly members felt that solar “works well in partnership with other existing technologies” or “could be a (smaller) part of future energy”, with “variable demand covered if combined with wind.” Others suggested that it “can be combined with storage.” One assembly member said it “can be integrated with existing systems.” Others commented that there “is always sun somewhere in the world so it lends itself to export/import.” Some wondered if we should “outsource to the Sahara where there is lots of sun” or suggested that we “could power share with other countries.”  Cost, the economy, and jobs Some assembly members said that solar is “getting cheaper”, “not too expensive” or that the “lifetime cost is low.” Some suggested that the “decreased cost of manufacture compared to when the technology was originally developed (has dropped exponentially) makes this a feasible technology.” Others noted the “low cost of installation” or said that it’s “free once the technology is installed.” Some assembly members pointed out the potential to make and save money. Some commented that “people can use them to lower [their] own bills” or that some people generate “so much energy that [they] can sell it back to the grid.” Others noted that it can “save people who have them on their houses a lot of money” or that in the “long term [it] can be a good investment for domestic bills.” Some assembly members said that “there are schemes available to support it, you can sell back to the grid/energy provider.” Others said that “loans are available from (some councils) for installation on households” and one assembly member noted that they “like the concept of renting roofs to the “Council” for solar generation.” Another individual assembly member shared that “when I sold my house the solar panels definitely contributed to the sale of the house (it made it easier to sell).” Some assembly members particularly liked the idea of solar farms, suggesting that they could involve bulk buying and therefore reduced costs. Others felt that solar panels are “expensive as [an] individual cost, but solar farms [are] ok as long as they are in the right place.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  383  Public support Some assembly members suggested that solar “gives people individual autonomy to generate power” or that you “can choose and manage your own power supply – sense of control.” Others said it “can be individual; on own property and you can control [the] energy coming in.” Some noted that you can be “independent of the national grid.” Some suggested that solar is a “a recognised technology” or that “the public understands how solar works”. Others said that it is “accepted by people.”  Safety and risk Some assembly members suggested there is “no risk” or said that that they “can’t see serious side effects (other than the rare earth point...).”  Cons Assembly members identified the following areas as points that they disliked about solar.  Environment impacts and land use A significant number of assembly members expressed concerns about land use. Some said that solar panels can “take up space” or that “solar fields could be put to better use.” Some suggested that they could have an impact on “land for food and on habitat.” Others said that there is “no space below” so “you can’t have sheep”, or suggested that “we need our fields for trees and plants” or for “biofuels.” Some assembly members commented that “it’s not good to be covering hectares of land – “big solar farms can increase the risk of flooding in areas: stops water going in[to the] soil and increases run off. Can put pressure in certain areas. Can’t be used on its own.” Others commented that they “don’t like fields of panels” or “don’t like it so much on land.” Some assembly members felt that solar panels are “not very attractive/look ugly on houses” or are “not aesthetically pleasing.” Some said that “on some modern houses they look fine, on others they look anachronistic/silly – can spoil the look of a street.” Some disliked “polluting PV manufacturing”, noting the “reliance on lithium and cobalt for the battery technology” and the mining of them as their particular concern. Some said there were “ethical issues” in these area and that these “apply to other variable renewables too.” For other assembly members concerns centred on the “impact on [the] local environment and biodiversity …primarily because of the surface heat produced.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  384  Practicality, efficiency, readiness and scale A sizeable number of assembly members suggested that “we’re not a sunny country all of the time – shortens the timespan for being able to generate the electricity, particularly in winter which is when we need the most energy for heat/light.” Others said that we’re a “miserable overcast country”, “power output [is] not when people use most electricity”, or that solar is “not viable because of reliability.” Some suggested that “solar does have a place in the Sahara desert…[c]ould put huge farms [there], but not so much a place for it in the UK.” Others objected to the fact that solar only works “during daylight” or lamented the “lack of night-time generation, i.e. if no battery storage.” Some noted the potential for particular problems in the North, suggesting that “shortened daylight hours in the North may make it less viable to rely on / more subject to variance and may require substantial transmission of the energy generated (including loss and cost factors).” Some said there “are limits to its scale in UK” or that “when productivity is low (e.g. winter) [we] would still need a baseline supply from another non variable source.” Some assembly members caveated their dislike, suggesting that “if storage is possible in batteries for later use, then there is potential.” One assembly member said it “can’t be the only solution.” Relatedly, some assembly members said that there would need to be “investment in batteries/ storage problems” or suggested that “questions remain about storing the excess – needs to be efficient in storing energy.” One assembly member commented on “grid capacity – more energy being produced than can be used / stored and therefore creates wastage.” Examining suitability from a different angle, some assembly members suggested that solar panels wouldn’t work for every building because they “cannot work for people in flats or high rises – so there is an equity issue”. Others said that “not every house is suitable (don’t have south facing roofs).” Some expressed doubts about how much electricity solar generates or its efficiency, suggesting that they “only generate a small amount”, that “amount of electricity they generate is questionable”, or that they are “not powerful enough to power the house.” Others suggested that they are “less efficient than wind”, or that people are “struggling to improve [them] and make [them] more efficient.” Some assembly members suggested that “installations only have a short life”, “need to be kept clean” or “need [to be] upgraded every few years.”  Cost, the economy, and jobs Some assembly members disliked the “cost of installations”, suggesting the solar panels are “expensive to put in at the moment” or that “installation costs are something people have to pay up front which could be a barrier.” Others suggested that solar panels represent “poor value for [the] average person in a house as there’s a slow payback.” Some assembly members said that they “can’t afford the capital outlay to pay for them,” noting that the price “has come down over the last ten years” but is still “£10k for the panels and then more for battery storage.” Some reported that the “batteries to store the solar power are expensive – this is a disincentive”. Other assembly members said that installing solar panels results in an “increase of business rates and [is] therefore not cost effective”; they suggested that “government needs to step up and change that.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  385  Some assembly members noted a lack of incentives, saying that the “reduction in feed in tariffs has become a disincentive”, that “government has stopped giving you money to have it on your house” or that “deals used to be available but aren’t any more.” Some assembly members said there were “potential implications when selling houses” or talked about “problems with insurance/ selling houses”, suggesting that “legislation needs to change on this.” Individual assembly members said solar is “underfunded and needs more research: or asked “how will it get paid for? Should not be only homeowners who need to pay.” One assembly member suggested there is a “danger that developers who can’t get planning permission to build on green belts are building solar farms to earn money.”  Public support No assembly members made comments in this area.  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  386  Safety and risk One assembly member expressed “concern about outsourcing to areas (Sahara example) as we don’t want to be dependent on others.”  Conditions Assembly members also noted conditions that they would want to be in place for this technology to be used, or that they felt would help its use. They suggested a need to:  Resolve issues around batteries and storage Some assembly members said they “do not have to be chemical batteries, other methods are available and should be considered,” or that “there needs to be suitable ways of managing batteries and the materials in them (concerns about hazardous materials and recycling).” Others said battery storage being available “is a condition” of their support for solar and that “battery research is needed.” Some assembly members disagreed with points about batteries, saying that “our task is carbon emissions, so the battery concerns are a smaller issue.”  Make it cheaper Some assembly members said it needs to be cheaper: “if the price comes down, people will put them on their homes.” Others suggested “incentivis[ing] the buildings that use electricity during the day to have solar panels (offices, factories etc).” On a similar theme, some assembly members commented that you “need to invest to make it cheaper” with some noting that there “should be government subsidies again as people were benefitting from them”, or grants, or “interest free [government] loans.” Conversely, some assembly members said they had “concerns about whether subsidies should be put here”, querying “is it worth it” or suggesting it “should only be done where there is enough sun, i.e. in the South.” Others suggested “mass production (if there were panels on every home) the cost would come down a lot.”  Change regulations Some assembly members said “at the minute you have to get approval to fit panels (we think from Building Control) – should be reversed so that it is a requirement (or at least incentivised).” Others said we should “chang[e] building regulations to ensure that every new build has to have solar panels fitted although 2016 legislation to have solar fitted to homes was rescinded because of pressure from developers.” Some assembly members said that they “also like Tesla roof panels, which are cheaper and act as a roof.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  387  Look at who pays Some assembly members suggested that “power companies should pay for installation, not homeowners (rent a roof schemes).” Others agreed saying it “should not be only homeowners who need to pay.”  Think about different types of building Some assembly members commented on different types of building that could have solar panels. These included new builds with some suggesting that “…solar panels should be mandatorily installed on all new buildings to feed into the grid”, that “new housing in the South should all have solar panels fitted when they are built as part of the planning permission”, or that “solar panels should be made compulsory on all new house builds. Government can set a date and costs will tumble.” Comments about other types of building included: “Should be government guidance that suggests every public building should have it… [This] seems like a sensible, logical solution.” “Need to be putting them on commercial buildings in the south.” “Make it mandatory for commercial buildings to use roofs for solar capture.” “Any building that could have solar panels should have them on it and community and public buildings should have panels on them that can be shared with the local community.” “Solar panels should be installed on all possible roof areas, private homes & business. This should be installed & managed by the energy companies with a small roof rental fee paid to the owner of the building. No expense to home owner and all electricity uploaded to the national grid.”  Target the right areas and houses Some assembly members said that “solar is more variable than wind and therefore probably most suited to certain parts of the country. Therefore support would be conditional on it being developed in the right areas where the technology will work best, rather than [it being] a default option.” Others said that whether it’s a good idea “depends on orientation of [the] house (better when south-facing) – you can get solar panels with motors on them which move around to catch more of the sun as the day goes by.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  388  Consider land use Some assembly members had opposing views about land use. Some asked to “avoid farming land”, with some saying they would “rather have wind if [we’re] going to use farm land for electricity generation.” Others said that we “should make better use of solar panels in fields, e.g. where sheep are already grazing” or that “solar farms should allow for crops or animals e.g. sheep to graze underneath and possibly more direct light to enable grass and quick growing crops to grow.” Some assembly members asked “whether it would be possible for solar and wind power sites to be co-located (a layered array) as this could be a more efficient use of land.” Other assembly members asked whether it is possible to “attach solar panels to windmills?”  Promote equality Some assembly members said they “would like to see more equal availability, e.g. people who live in high-rise flats can’t put up panels.”  Improve visual design Some assembly members said solar panels would “need to be visually good looking – more presentable as part of the building e.g. solar roof tiles.” Others asked if there “are ways to make them look nicer” or wondered if there could “be better control of how they’re administered so they fit in visually a bit more?” Conversely, some assembly members said we “have to accept that things aren’t going to look nice to deal with climate change” or that we “need to take a holistic view on whole impact.”  Improve efficiency and scale Some assembly members said that “efficiencies need to be improved, ideally getting more energy out of smaller solar [panels].” Others said it “needs to be scaled up to meet demand and part of a combined solution with wind.”  Conduct more research Some assembly members said it’s “underfunded and needs more research.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  389  Two assembly members made further points: lifestyle behaviour would have to change to accommodate using renewables “ Our efficiently (which appliances get used at which time in the day etc).” solar – i.e. focusing sunlight onto a hotbox (i.e. a dark box to absorb heat). “ Alternative These are cheaper to construct and can be used to generate energy.” As seen in Section A, assembly members expressed significant support for solar in their votes.  B.4 Bioenergy Bioenergy means burning wood or crops to generate electricity. Assembly members discussed this technology in small groups, noting pros and cons.  Pros Assembly members identified the following areas as points that they liked about bioenergy.  Environment impacts and land use Some assembly members liked “the cycle of carbon capture and release and the balance” or the “cyclical nature of the process.” Others noted that it “takes CO2 out of the atmosphere, but then puts it back out, but this is a balanced system.” Relatedly, some assembly members described bioenergy as “carbon neutral” or suggested it “can be carbon neutral if done right.” Others said it “emits little to no net greenhouse gas emissions” because of the “cycle”. Some assembly members liked that bioenergy is “renewable”, suggesting that “with fertile soil we should always have a renewable source.” Others said that “pellets are a straight replacement for coal and therefore [a] more reliable form of electricity. We know exactly what we can produce.” Some assembly members said that they “’love [the] idea of growing more crops” or “growing trees to absorb CO2.” Some noted that “crops like willow are native/indigenous trees.” One assembly members said it’s “better for environmental health as no radiation …[unlike] nuclear.”  Practicality, efficiency, readiness and scale A sizeable number of assembly members liked when bioenergy “uses waste” saying it “makes sense when it’s an off product” or “if it already exists and [we] need to get rid of it, that’s great.” Assembly members talked about different kinds of waste:  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  390  + Some focussed on timber and forest management, saying they liked the idea of “using waste from the timber producing process – so bits that are not normally used can be used up”, or we “have to cut down forests which creates natural waste that isn’t of any use – needs to be disposed of so producing biomass from it is good.” Some suggested we can “can use parts of trees that aren’t being used for other purposes e.g. branches” or said it’s “good to use forest residue as if [we] don’t take trees away forests become clogged up and trees don’t grow properly – need to take trees away anyway for management.”; + Some mentioned “unused crops”, or proposed that “councils could collect garden waste and burn [it] for bioenergy (some are)”; + Others talked about using “rubbish that can’t be recycled”, suggesting it would result in “less rubbish in landfill”, or wondered if we could “also burn sewage / plastics etc.” One assembly member commented: “recycle our waste bins, domestic sewerage, farming and commercial waste to make biofuel. Landfill sites cannot accommodate all of the waste in the future”; + Some said they felt that “landfill is a worry so [we] like the idea of using methane from landfill for energy purposes.” Others suggested that “chicken waste products…[are] a better option than burning trees” or that “taking any waste is a good idea, but why do you have to grow [things for] it.” Some assembly members liked that bioenergy can produce useful by-products. Some said you can “use heat as a by-product” or “use waste as fertiliser at the end.” Some suggested that producing heat “could be especially positive if developed in localised ways – providing both [heat and electricity] to communities.” Others noted that you can also create “fuels (e.g. ethanol from sugar beet.” Some assembly members liked that “existing power stations can be converted to use biofuels.” Their reasons included that: + It “reduce[s] construction costs and redundant sites”; + The “refit [of] existing coal power plants [allows you to]…keep jobs in communities that would otherwise lose jobs.” Some noted that “coal plants … are often located in areas of deprivation” and suggested that the “current skills power plant staff have are transferable to biomass technology”; + Others said that “…chang[ing] from coal to wood” creates “less CO2” and is “cheaper.” Some assembly members said that they “liked that 58 factories have already converted to use their own biomass for electricity and this made it cheaper for them (cut power costs from 80%).” Some assembly members suggested that bioenergy “could be useful” in “some places…e.g. waste products, handling food waste BUT [is] not [the] main solution for energy.” Others said it “has its place in aviation or other areas where we usually use fossil fuels” or that it “provides a good back-up supply.” Some assembly members said that “because it’s constant…it could partially fill a gap for when other renewables are being variable (e.g. wind and solar).” Some assembly members suggested that it’s “scalable”, “could produce a high percentage of our energy” or “generates lots of energy.” Some said they liked its “efficiency” or noted that it “only takes two years.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  391  One assembly member said “when a tree decomposes it will release the carbon…, so when burning it you’re making use of something that’s going to happen anyway.” Other points made by individual assembly members were that “it is doing well so keep doing it”, that you “could use abandoned or derelict land e.g. former mines” or that “you can produce this in different ways.” One commented “you are storing energy.”  Cost, the economy, and jobs Some assembly members suggested that bioenergy creates “income for farmers” or is “good for second generation farmers that don’t want to be investing time in land management – can grow crops easily.” Others said that it “could be beneficial for farmers looking to change land use as we move away from as much animal farming.” A number of assembly members said that it’s “cheaper than extracting fossil fuels” or can be “stored with minimal energy costs.” Some said that it “employs a lot of people.”  Public support No assembly members had comments in this area.  Safety and risk No assembly members had comments in this area.  Other Some assembly members liked the fact you can do it “locally” or that it offers “local solutions.” Others said it is “a solution that works at a small scale” and gave an example of where bioenergy is already being used on an estate. One assembly member said the “overall impact is positive, despite potential for pollution.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  392  Cons Assembly members identified the following areas as points that they disliked about bioenergy.  Environment impacts and land use Some assembly members suggested that it “could be worse for the environment if not done effectively, sustainably”, that “in some circumstances it’s worse for climate change, so it depends on what you’re growing and where, and what you’re burning”, or that “getting people to stick to the sustainability criteria might be a challenge if the incentives aren’t there.” Some worried about the “impact on biodiversity” including querying whether there was a “risk of a monoculture possibly if planting lots of these crops?” Some talked about the “USA experience of growing corn for ethanol” suggesting that the “environmental impact was high” and that they had “similar concern about palm oil and associated deforestation.” Others felt there was a “danger that it incentivises farmers to overwork the land, apply fertilisers to promote growth for bigger yields and destroy the soil.” Similarly some said there was a “danger that soil doesn’t get a rest.” One assembly member noted that “I don’t like anything that is going to destroy the environment for animals (habitat destruction). When cutting down trees – this causes a lot of disruption to animals.” On a similar theme, some assembly members suggested there are “too many incentives to cheat and for bad behaviour” or that “bio fuels seem too easily exploited.” Some assembly members suggested that bioenergy “doesn’t so much reduce carbon as recycle it” or “putting CO2 back into the atmosphere is not good.” Others said that it is “not carbon neutral” or “do[es] not reduce the CO2 and potentially uses up a lot of land which could otherwise be capturing and storing carbon.” Some assembly members queried what happens to the carbon footprint “when [you] factor in harvesting, shipping” or suggested that it can be “carbon intensive” because “some emit a lot of carbon e.g. wood pellets exported from US to Europe to burn.” Others suggested it “produces more CO2 than coal and fossil fuels (produces in burning 5% more CO2)” or that it’s a “red herring to say that it was more carbon friendly.” Others noted mixed messages, saying “wood [is a] common cooking fuel, but [we’re] being told [we] shouldn’t use wood and coal, seems a backward step, still emitting carbon.” Expanding on a point touched on above, some assembly members suggested that bioenergy “doesn’t seem like the best use of land”: − Some felt that we “need more land to grow trees” or that it’s “inefficient if we use land for it, when we need land for other things (farming/trees etc)”; − Others expressed concerns around food production: “How much land will we need to sacrifice to growing bio-fuel crops, instead of using the land to grow food?” Some assembly members said that “food production is more of a priority for land use (especially in light of COVID-19)” or asked “couldn’t we use the crops for food instead rather than growing soy in a different country and bringing it in?” Others said that “growing crops specifically for this is not a good use of limited arable land.” Some assembly members said that they are “concerned that we will keep using more and more bioenergy and this will have a negative impact on land use.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  393  Also developing points already mentioned, some assembly members said that they disliked “transporting things long distances” or that the “transportation and equipment needed for bioenergy leads to pollution.” Some said specifically that “importing other waste products increases [the] carbon generated by transport.” Some assembly members made more general comments about importing, saying they disliked that “wood chips are being imported rather than produced locally” or questioning “will it be done in [an] environmentally friendly way.” Some assembly members expressed concerns about burning waste, with one assembly member saying that a local incinerator that had been built for pellets subsequently started to burn household waste as well. Others said they “worry about the big chimneys from the plant… particularly when burning waste….” Relatedly, some assembly members suggested that there would be “pollution from the smoke” or that it’s “not good for air quality or lungs.” Others described it as “not clean”, or said that it “releases carbon monoxide” or that there is a “risk of harmful toxins.” Some assembly members worried about the “chemicals used to grow the crops and also side effects of growing new crops.” Some assembly members said they had personal experience of “allergies from expansion in growth of oil seed rape” and asked “might miscanthus have a similar impact?”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  394  Practicality, efficiency, readiness and scale Some assembly members said that it’s “strange to burn something you grow” or that it’s a “shame to keep planting trees and chopping them down.” Others asked “how many trees do you have to chop down to get enough energy” or suggested it would be “difficult to get the [right] balance of growing trees and burning [them].” Some said it was “strange to balance [it] with something that is so damaging e.g deforestation”, or suggested it “could lead to deforestation” or that we would have to be “careful [we were] not contributing to deforestation – need replanting.” Others said that “using forest by-products doesn’t seem right” or that they disliked “crops being grown to burn.” Some assembly members felt that burning trees “defeats the object” because “a young tree does take a lot of the carbon out of the atmosphere but by burning it we put it back in so we don’t get away from the existing cycle.” Others said “we should plant forests instead, to store carbon, and leave them where they are not burn them for electricity.” Some assembly members suggested that bioenergy “requires a lot of organic matter and water – have we got the resources?” Others noted that it “requires space and water.” Some suggested that “it’s not efficient” or “doesn’t contain a lot of energy compared to fossil fuels.” Others questioned, “can we get all our needs from this?” Some assembly members said they had questions about “scalability”, suggesting that the “capacity for development isn’t clear.” Others wondered if it was possible to do it at scale “without growing crops specifically to fuel a plant.” A number of assembly members suggested that other technologies are better. Some asked “why bother putting money into something that might not work?” when there are “already other established technology options (wind, etc…).” Others noted the need for “transportation for what is going to be burnt, which doesn’t apply to wind/solar” or said that only “10% [is] used for electricity the rest for fuel – so is it worth using it for electricity? – think there are better options.” Some commented simply that we “have better ways of producing the energy.” Individual assembly members commented that it’s “complicated to do”, that it “won’t work in long term” or that you “need to wait some time before wood can be harvested.” One assembly member said we “should use bioenergy for other things besides electricity, e.g. materials.”  Cost, the economy, and jobs Some assembly members said it is “expensive to set up bioenergy plants”, “more expensive to generate energy in this way” or suggested that bioenergy is “expensive and makes a small contribution to energy supply.” Some suggested that it’s “a lot of money for something that could be worse for the climate.” Other assembly members expressed concerns about “cost effectiveness for the farmers who will be growing the trees – will they get extra money for doing so?” One assembly member referenced the “…experience of NI government losing lots of money on subsidies.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  395  Public support No assembly members made comments in this area.  Safety and risk Some assembly members said that they disliked the “need to capture the carbon” or expressed “concern that it might be storing up problems for the future.”  Conditions Assembly members also noted conditions that they would want to be in place for this technology to be used, or that they felt would help its use. They suggested a need to:  Look at what is being burnt Assembly members made points including: “Less keen on growing crops specifically to burn” “Depends what is burnt, has to give carbon neutral effect” “Must not burn natural trees/forests/woodland, but only burn waste or what is left” “It’s an advantage if reusing waste, not adding to it” “Don’t cut old growth forests for biomass, only use fuel from plantations” “Got to plant a lot of trees, and forestry management to get to net zero. This forestry management will have bio side-products as they manage the woods. Can’t let this decay and using this for small amounts of bio-generation makes sense.“ “Could we also harvest kelp offshore? Why only think about this onshore?”  Make sure it’s done sustainably Some assembly members suggested that “strong regulation would be needed to ensure it’s not more polluting than fossil fuels” or that it “needs strict rules to ensure that it is done sustainably.” Others suggested that it “needs to be done correctly to make sure it works” or “needs to be managed.” Some said you need to “balance…the 36 [sustainability] factors on the graph in the presentation [by Patricia Thornley].” Other comments included:  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  396  “There are a wide variety of forms of bioenergy and each must be considered carefully based on its overall carbon emissions at all points in the supply chain and consumption. Currently wood pellet energy production is causing mass clear cutting of old growth forests in the United States so this supposedly carbon neutral form of energy is actually causing more carbon emissions than fossil fuel. Any adoption of bioenergy needs to be carefully considered against its entire carbon picture.” “I disagree that biofuels should be used if the fuel sources are being transported from great distances – as they are now from North America.”  Create a balance with other energy sources Some assembly members suggested that bioenergy “needs to be balanced with other energy sources” or that we “need a little bit of everything.”  Individual assembly members suggested a need to think about “where it’s sited” or provide farmers with subsidies. One commented: “Native trees should be grown rather than non-native so that natural habitats are created which is far better for native wildlife and restoring our countryside.” Some assembly members suggested that “globally, people will need this.” As seen in Section A, assembly members expressed limited support for bioenergy in their votes.  B.5 Nuclear Nuclear means using heat from nuclear reactions to make electricity. Assembly members discussed this technology in small groups, noting pros and cons.  Pros Assembly members identified the following areas as points that they liked about nuclear.  Environment impacts and land use Some assembly members felt that nuclear is “clean” or clean in terms of emissions, commenting that it is “currently one of cleanest in emissions so good as a short term solution.” Others said it is “clean (if we can dispose of [the] end products)”, or that it “doesn’t produce any greenhouse gases at all.” Some noted that there is a “low carbon footprint from production.” Some assembly members said it creates “no pollution” or “less pollution than other technologies.” Some assembly members described it as “sustainable.” One assembly member suggested that there is “no effect on water/land/ecosystems if [there are] no accidents.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  397  Practicality, efficiency, readiness and scale Some assembly members commented on scale, suggesting that “it could supply up to 75% of our electricity needs”, “can generate a lot of electricity”, has “massive potential” or is like “turning on a tap.” Others talked about the “sheer volume that this technology can produce…”, saying that the “scope is vast” or “at [the] levels we need in the future.” Some suggested that “it would take 300 turbines of 10MW to produce the same amount of electricity as Hinkley Point C. In fact, three times that as a turbine only operates at 30% capacity.” One assembly member said “if done correctly, [it] could be a total solution.” Some assembly members liked the fact it is a “constant source” that is “available all of the time” or is “not a variable source.” Others described it as “reliable” or “consistent”, or said that it produces a “stable supply” of “guaranteed energy.” Some branded it the “only reliable (constant) source of carbon neutral electricity” or “an effective source of power.” For some assembly members it “seem[ed] efficient” or is “extremely efficient.” Others said it “gets more energy faster, compared to the other technologies.” One assembly member commented that it “lasts a long time.” Making a somewhat related point, a number of assembly members suggested that nuclear could provide a “baseload” of “stable” energy “which works hand in hand with wind and solar, [and which we] can crank up to address peak times.” Others commented on the “ability with a small number of sites to provide a good baseload that can be topped up with variable sources.” Some liked the fact you can “control output.” Some assembly members suggested that nuclear “use[s] [the] existing infrastructure available” or uses “systems already in place.” Others said it “could continue to use sites with existing connectivity infrastructure in place even when decommissioned.” Some assembly members liked the fact it is “proven” or an “existing technology.” Some approved of the fact it “doesn’t use fossil fuels” or is “not reliant on fossil fuels.” Others saw a “role for the nuclear plants that already exist to make up for that [fossil fuel] gap (so we don’t have to use more oil and gas), but [said they were] not sure about building new ones.”  Cost, the economy, and jobs Some assembly members said it “can create jobs in remote areas” or “creates a lot of jobs in Cumbria.” Others said there would be “jobs in the building and management of it” or “lots of high skilled jobs.” Some assembly members suggested that “where nuclear power stations already exist, people want them because of the jobs.” For some assembly members nuclear was “cheap to run once built”, “cheap to operate” or just “cheap.” Others said “once it gets going it’s cheap (although not cheap to build).”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  398  Public support Individual assembly members said there are “no complaints from locals near Sizewell” or that they “like idea of smaller plants, depending on local people and whether they want it and the waste from the smaller plants.”  Safety and risk Some assembly members said that they were not overly worried about safety for a variety of reasons: “Safety is paramount even on the build. Checked and checked again. We have a good record, can’t see building a new one being a source of concerns.” “Growing expertise in managing nuclear waste means risks should be able to be managed.” “I used to be anti-nuclear, but I’ve now changed my view. As a resource, it can be used in a safe way. The waste can be managed better than carbon capture and storage.” One assembly member said “when it goes it wrong it goes badly wrong, but equally we accept other risks in our daily lives, when statistically nuclear isn’t as bad.” Another assembly member gave the example of “air pollution from fossil fuels which cause[s] deaths and is accepted as normal.” Some assembly members made international comparisons, suggesting that “France is a good model of how it works safely” or that “Three Mile island or Fukushima used a different type of reactor.” Others suggested that “if France can be confident in running nuclear sites safely surely we can (and given parts of France are closer to the UK than other parts of the UK then their risk is our risk anyway).” Other assembly members said more broadly that it can be “made safe” and that the risk of something “disastrous” is “low.” One assembly member said “I appreciate the environmental dangers but on the other hand we need it.”  Other Some assembly members expressed varying views on imports, either seeing it as a plus that we “could import from other countries”, or alternatively liking the fact of “not having to.” One assembly member said it “uses brainpower and knowledge, employs intellectual thought.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  399  Cons Assembly members identified the following areas as points that they disliked about nuclear.  Environment impacts and land use Some assembly members suggested nuclear is “not clean” or has a poor overall carbon footprint. Some said that there are “no greenhouse gases but it does produce nuclear waste which could be worse than a greenhouse gas. It’s low carbon but not clean.” Others said that “mining uranium uses a lot of energy” or that “there are huge amounts of embodied carbon in the concrete used to build a nuclear power station and to decommission it.” Some assembly members said that nuclear is “not actually renewable.” Some assembly members worried about “half-life – what impact on wildlife.” Others said more generally that they were concerned about “environment impact” or whether it will be “harmful to [the] environment in the long term.”  Practicality, efficiency, readiness and scale Some assembly members said that the “timescales are too long compared to wind and solar”, suggesting that it “takes 20 years to build…[and] wind can be cranked up much more easily.” Others said it “takes a long time to develop” or that the “timescales for building are unknown and unpredictable”. Some assembly members raised practical issues around nuclear waste, suggesting we will “need new sites for storing waste” or asking whether it is “moral to store [waste] outside of this country.” Some declared “doubts about …[the] efficiency of waste management.” Some assembly members suggested that nuclear is “outdated” or said they are “huge plants… the technology is backward thinking.” One assembly member disliked that it “uses lots of space.” Some asked “why use nuclear when we can generate power from wind?” For some assembly members, the “need to keep it going all the time” was a disadvantage, with others suggesting it “takes 3 days to start and 3 days to stop so isn’t flexible.”  Cost, the economy, and jobs A sizeable number of assembly members described nuclear as “expensive”, or “incredibly expensive”, with some suggesting that the “costs are astronomical”. Some specifically mentioned the “huge expense to build new plants”, commenting it is “twice the costs of other plants” or “twice that for a wind farm.” Others highlighted “expensive decommissioning”, the “costs of management”, the “very expensive steam train – very harmful by-product”, or said that “safety makes it cost a lot.” Others noted the “costs of waste management” suggesting that “waste needs managing over 100s of years” and that it’s “not worth it when we have wind to use.” Others labelled nuclear “the most expensive technology available”, said that “the costs go up once you start to build” or that costs are “unknown and unpredictable.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  400  Some assembly members said “wave isn’t being pursued because of the cost, so why are we focusing on nuclear? I.e. there are so many other options.” Some suggested that “the huge amounts of money needed for nuclear could be spent on renewables….” One assembly member said nuclear “doesn’t employ as many people at plants.” Another said “unlike other options this is unlikely to bring down individual bills.”  Public support Location and public acceptability – some assembly members predicted “location issues” with some saying “they’ve got a bad reputation similar to Onshore Wind for example – buildit, but not near me!” Others talked about “not wanting to live next door to something like this, whether it’s a plant and/or a waste site…” or said that “no-one wants one [a nuclear power station] nearby.” Others said that the “risk of accidents means public acceptability might be low.” Some assembly members said that “the smaller models described are still quite large industrial units and identifying appropriate sites might be difficult.” Some assembly members said that the “small scale option is a nice idea but with NIMBYISM….” Weapons connection – some assembly members talked about the “possible use for weapons – big danger” or said it is “seen to exist originally for nuclear bomb[s].”  Safety and risk A sizeable number of some assembly members said there have been “too many disaster stories, and they are massive disasters.” Others said nuclear is “really dangerous” or that it would be “incredibly scary, if something happened.” Some noted that the “impact of a nuclear disaster (e.g. Chernobyl, Fukushima) can be terrible.” Others used words including “cataclysmic” or “catastrophic.” Some assembly members talked about the “risks” being “too large” of “unpredictability/ leak/ accident.” Some assembly members said they “don’t think they can make it safe”, suggesting there’s been “a disaster every 10 years.” Others felt “climate change and rising water levels” bring new concerns, or said that “building them on the coast is ridiculous – especially in times of rising sea levels.” Others said that nuclear was “not worth the costs and risks comparatively.” One assembly member said that a “beach is radioactive in my area. The dangers are not appreciated. House prices have fallen.” Another commented that “all the materials at the plant are irradiated.” Another sizeable number of assembly members raised a range of concerns about “nuclear decommissioning / waste storage”: − Many worries centred on the long-term impact and whether we are “kicking the can down the road – [a] big no no.” Some assembly members asked “what happens after a hundred years” or suggested that “storage facilities don’t last forever.” Others said that it would “adversely affect my children and grandchildren due to the long-term waste.” Some commented that “some of the waste can be radioactive for thousands of years. Where are you going to put that and how can you be sure someone won’t dig it up at some point and have an issue?”;  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  401  − Some assembly members said storage was “dependant on geology to be stable – what happens if [there’s] a big earthquake and waste leaks?”; − Others discussed current examples. Some argued that waste is “being managed quite well at Sellafield” but others disagreed saying that “it’s only being temporarily stored.” Others suggested that “there are 20 nuclear submarines in Plymouth waiting 30 years to be dismantled. It hasn’t been done as there is no safe way to do it. There will be more in the coming years.” For some assembly members there was “obviously no solution to the waste issue or it would have been found already.” For others “UK designs for new builds are faulty.” One assembly member said they had concerns about the “transport of nuclear fuels.” Some assembly members commented that “the generation process is more scientific and complicated compared to others, so can’t completely understand how it works. Makes it harder for us to be confident that its use it OK.”  Conditions Assembly members also noted conditions that they would want to be in place for this technology to be used, or that they felt would help its use. They suggested a need to:  Phase out nuclear Phase out nuclear “as their life span ends” in favour of renewables  Build a minimum amount “Build a minimum amount to provide a baseline but focus on variable options in the main.” Others said that nuclear “should only be a backup when needed.”  Sort out the waste Some assembly members said we “need to work a lot harder on nuclear waste management to ensure safe and secure storage to manage the public perception for what is an efficient technology.”  Import it (possibly) Some assembly members said that you could “build in other countries, where there’s more support/acceptance with [the] public (e.g. France) and import energy BUT [there are then] worries then about security and international relations.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  402  Reuse sites Some assembly members suggested that “if we can repurpose the sites and reuse them that would be good.”  Be self-reliant Some assembly members said that we will “need to import energy if we cannot make out own, so nuclear may be needed.”  Some assembly members added an additional thought: much of a consideration, really, is the cost? We are told that we can’t afford things “ asHowa country, but coronavirus has shown that we can spend money when we need to. The point is that the politics of these decisions is important and relevant.” As seen in Section A, assembly members expressed limited support for nuclear in their votes.  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  403  B.6 Fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage Fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage means capturing and storing around 90% of the carbon dioxide released by burning fossil fuels like gas and coal. Assembly members discussed this technology in small groups, noting pros and cons.  Pros Assembly members identified the following areas as points that they liked about fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage.  Environment impacts and land use Some assembly members liked that you “can capture 90% of CO2” or said it “seems to tackle head on the challenge of reducing the carbon in the atmosphere through storage.” One assembly member commented that “we learned that the chemicals (amines) used to capture the carbon can be recycled and reused.”  Practicality, efficiency, readiness and scale For some assembly members, the potential to use existing markets, technology and infrastructure was a plus. Some noted that it “use[s] fossil fuels therefore [we] can use existing markets” or that “we know the technology [for fossil fuels].” Others said they liked that we can “use existing power stations,” that the “facilities [are] already there” or that we “already have the power stations, all we need is to capture the carbon that’s coming out of them.” Some said we have “evidence that fossil fuels work.” Relatedly, some assembly members suggested and that we are “not limited in supply [of fossil fuels]”, that we “still have fossil fuels to use” or that this “uses fossil fuels while we still have them.” Others were much more muted in their praise, suggesting that there are “no positives – except familiarity.” Some assembly members felt this option could be used short-term or as part of a transition. Some said if we are “still burning fossil fuels [it’s] important to consider how can do that while still working out how to improve renewables.” Others said there’s a “possibility that it could be the least disruptive, as [we] could continue to use fossil fuels, at least in the transition phase.” Some suggested that it could “be used…[in the] short-term where there’s no other solution”, or that this is the “same technology as we use currently so [it] can be adopted as an intermediate solution to give us time to work on other alternatives.” Some assembly members said that fossil fuels are “easily found” or that “we’re doing it already and can access it easily (i.e. it’s onshore I think).” Some assembly members said it “can be done” or “can be done quickly.” Some commented that we “need to balance the grid – if [we] have sporadic wind/solar energy, [we] need something reliable like CCS to balance it with.” Others described is as “more reliable (no seasonal/weather effects).”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  404  Some assembly members focussed on the technology for carbon capture and storage, suggesting it is proven and viable: “CCS has already taken place at industrial scale in America. It is a proven technology. It is not just being trialled.” “Norway has been doing that for 10–15 years. Not as scary as we think it is. Seems like a possible alternative.” “CCS is a valid technology for when making cement or things that we really need to use large amounts of electricity for and for which there is no alternative.” Others commented that “CCS [is] underway and oil wells [for storage are] a viable option….” Also in relation to on carbon capture and storage, some assembly members said that it’s a “good idea to put carbon underground”, that it’s “easy to put away under the sea” or “quite safe once stored (we believe).” Individual assembly members suggested that it could “generate lot of electricity from single location”, or that the CO2 “doesn’t take up much space (as it’s converted to liquid).” Another said that they liked that it’s a “switch on / switch off electricity source.” One assembly member commented that I “wondered in the past – when not knowing so much about climate change – why it wasn’t possible to get a giant space hoover to suck all the carbon out of the atmosphere, this technology sounds a little bit like that!”  Cost, the economy, and jobs Some assembly members suggested it “could create jobs if it led to re-opening some coal mines” or that it would be “good for UK regions with coal mines.” Some felt it would be “cost effective” or “cheaper.” One assembly member said “if we are well placed for geological storage sites we may be able to sell off storage space to supplement investment in other technologies in the short term.”  Public support Some assembly members suggested we could “carry on [our] lives as normal, able to burn coal/wood” or that there would be “little change to our way of life.” Some assembly members suggested that there “is a reason people are looking at it as it allows us to keep our way of life.”  Safety and risk Some assembly said they are “more favourable towards this than nuclear” or liked it more than nuclear “with regard to potential waste leaks as [it’s] not going to kill people immediately.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  405  Other One assembly members said that they “trust that technology will come up with answers.”  Cons Assembly members identified the following areas as points that they disliked about fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage.  Environment impacts and land use A sizeable number of assembly members said that they disliked the continued use of fossil fuels, suggesting that “carrying on as normal, doesn’t do much to help climate change”, or that it “just sidesteps the issue.” Others said it is “not real change – doesn’t address the… need to change energy production long-term,” or commented that “we’re already too reliant on them [fossil fuels]” – “it is not a future proofing solution.” Some assembly members said that this “feels like the lazy option. Fossil fuels will run out eventually, so hesitant to carry on as normal if we can invest in other technologies.” Others agreed: “Fossil fuels – their time is up. Let’s move on to clean energy, don’t go back to fossil fuels.” “Investing in this is money that is not invested in renewables – just invest in that instead. This is delaying doing what we will have to anyway.” Other assembly members said they do not want to “suppor[t] a dirty industry” or suggested that fossil fuels have “lots of negatives that aren’t attributed to the carbon” including that the “harvesting of fuels causes disease” or the “impact on [the] environment when [they are] extracted.” Some commented “burn but capture seems illogical when there is no need to burn, why not just leave fuels where they are.” One assembly member suggested that “there is a big lobby pushing for this which points to business as usual.” Another said that “current CCS is used to increase production of fossil fuels (to extract more oil / gas from reserves).” Some assembly members disliked that you “only get some of it out when capturing carbon” or noted that “still 10% of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels [is] going out into the atmosphere.” Others said they “don’t like [the] idea of creating waste and just putting it aside. Renewables don’t have that problem.” For some assembly members fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage was a “timebomb for later.” Others said it “reeks of short-termism”, “doesn’t protect future generations”, “moves the problem to the next generation”, gives the “future generation headaches” or is a “short term answer, not [a] long term [one].” Some assembly members commented that “if the intention [is] to make use of one main technology, [the] cost of carbon capture feels like an expensive way to go, and seems like it’s taking a burying ‘head in the sand’ approach’ – oh we’ve got this space, let’s just put it there!” Some branded it “a selfish approach” or said “out of sight out of mind.” Others said it seems “like a sticking plaster / temporary solution” or a “magic unicorn people are chasing when simpler solutions are in front of us.” One assembly member suggested it was “not sustainable.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  406  Practicality, efficiency, readiness and scale Some assembly members suggested it “seems unrealistic”, is “not viable”, “not reliable” or is “nowhere near being ready.” Others said that the “capturing process is new” or that “carbon capture isn’t ready as a technology at the moment compared to others which are better options.” Some said that the “technology is at an early state, not yet ready” or asked “why invest in the unknown if other options are available.” Some assembly members suggested that this way of generating electricity is “not that efficient” or that there are “limits to where this could efficiently be undertaken due to storage sites.” Some assembly members disliked the “energy required to do the CCS” or the “energy cost.” Some noted that “a lot of energy is required to run the CC process (10% of the electricity being generated at a power plant).” Some assembly members suggested that “storage capacity is limited – it’s 100 years so it’s only a short term solution.” Individual assembly members commented that it “takes more land to build pipes”, or branded it “old fashioned.” One said: “In the future I think the only use of fossil fuels should be for when there is no current alternative such as air travel. And since carbon capture has limited space – though there is a lot – it should also be reserved for other circumstances, such as industrial processes that produce a lot of CO2 but that can’t be done another way.”  Cost, the economy, and jobs Some assembly members suggested that that it is an “expensive process”, “ridiculously expensive” or that it “doubles the costs of new power stations.” Others said that the “initial cost is high”, “seems prohibitive” or “will require a lot of investment.” Some suggested that for it “to be viable to pipe the stored carbon to offshore repositories … expensive new infrastructure would have to be built along the coasts.” Others noted that “tech for CCS is expensive…[but] might get cheaper.” Some assembly members commented that “wind [is] cheaper than fossil fuels, then add cost of CCS and [it’s even] worse.”  Public support Some assembly members recalled that “a Speaker during one of the early weekends said that we don’t want to push CCS. Might make people feel we don’t need to change as we have that to fall back on. There are lots of other options that don’t carry risks.” Others agreed saying “a lot of people don’t want to have to change their lifestyles: if presented with CCS, you can carry on doing what you are doing, people are more likely to do that.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  407  Safety and risk A sizeable number of assembly members said they were worried about risks with carbon capture and storage. For some this was about the “risks of leakages during storage” including “major leak[s].” Some asked “how can you be 100% it’s never going to leak or something’s not going to disturb it?” or “what happens if there’s an earthquake with lots of carbon stored under the sea.” Others worried about risks during transfer, noting “the CO2 is transferred to its destination under high pressure – this creates a huge risk if [a] pipe fails”. One assembly member commented “I’d rather have a turbine fall over in the sea.” Others queried how carbon dioxide “can be stored without damaging water supplies” or suggested there’s a risk of it “turning to acid if mixed with water.” Some asked about the impact on “marine life”, or the “soil and the sea if the carbon leaks out.” Some assembly members expressed concerns about the involvement of big business: “What happens if the carbon leaks out – do we pay them to capture it again?” For some assembly members, their conclusion was that “they [those responsible] have no idea what the implications are”, won’t “know [the] impact until something happens” or that there are “too many unknowns about safe storage and the impacts of leakage.” Making a slightly different point, some assembly members said that CCS “is a gamble and we don’t know if it will work.”  Other Some assembly members said that fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage “should be [a] last resort and phased out by 2050.”  Conditions Assembly members also noted conditions that they would want to be in place for this technology to be used, or that they felt would help its use. They suggested a need to:  See it as a transition only Some assembly members said they’d support this technology “if we see it as a transition, not as a long term solution. It will take time to switch to 100% renewables.” Other assembly members suggested that “we’re not going to be able to build the wind/nuclear technology capacity we need within the next 30 years. So, we need to convert these plants to get to net zero – using carbon capture feels like a necessary interim solution.”  Bring the costs down Some assembly members said that “if [we] could get cost down [we] would be more favourable.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  408  Regulate and monitor Some assembly members said that “CCS needs [a] high level of regulation and monitoring to ensure it is being done safely and that it remains safe when buried.”  Develop the technology Some assembly members said that the “technology needs further development before it can be widely used.”  Find more storage space Some assembly members said that we “need more space to bury the CO2 than the original fuel that was extracted (we think).”  Look for alternatives to storage Some assembly members suggested that “if it is stored in volcanic rock it becomes a solid, if put into [the] north sea it remains a liquid – why not capture it and turn it into plastics or gravel rather than putting it underground where it might leak.” Others said we “should absorb the carbon in more natural ways.”  Bear hydrogen in mind Some assembly members said that “if we use hydrogen from gas in the future, then CCS is essential” or that we should “use the CO2 generated to produce hydrogen, as opposed to capturing and storing it.”  Availability of fossil fuels Some assembly members said that their support for this technology would “depend on how much fossil fuels the UK has left.”  Use it where needed Some assembly members suggested that you “could use this option for [synthetic fuels for] bigger machinery, eg HGVs, aeroplanes and agri-machinery.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  409  Tax it “I would like to see an end to use of all fossil fuels, but if the technology is not yet there, then high carbon taxes to deter and reduce their use would also help pay for more research.”  As seen in Section A, assembly members expressed little support for fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage in their votes.  C. Other technologies Assembly members had only heard a very small amount about other technologies – hydro, wave, tidal and geothermal – in one of the presentations. The ballot paper nonetheless gave assembly members the opportunity to leave comments on these options, if they wished to do so. Seventytwo assembly members wrote down their thoughts.  C.1 General comments Some assembly members made general comments about all four technologies, or several of them at once. Most comments were positive, with very few assembly members mentioning points that they disliked. Some assembly members noted conditions that they would want to be in place for these technologies to be used, or that they felt would help their use.  Pros Consider in the right areas Several assembly members suggested using these technologies in targeted local areas. Remarks included: “I think all these options should also be considered in … areas of the UK where they have the natural resources to be able to use these technologies.” “In the locations where the special conditions exist (e.g. appropriate topography) these alternative technologies need to be applied – we shouldn’t focus only on the few mainstream low carbon technologies.” “I think there is an opportunity for local areas to explore these smaller forms of electricity generation where these are viable options but that the majority of the nation’s resources should focus on the technologies described …[earlier].”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  410  Stability and a mix of renewables Some assembly members emphasised the need to use a mix of renewable technologies: “I think we need to maximise all possible sources of renewable energy to ensure all year round electricity.” “Despite the cost, hydro and tidal power should be expanded wherever possible as they can provide a more stable source of energy production. A large mix of clean renewable energy sources can meet most of our demand and must be heavily invested in.” “Resources should be natural, have longevity, and be reasonably predictable. We should not ask if we can afford to do it but if we can afford not to do it. Tidal, Geothermal and Hydro are front runners.”  Support for tidal, wave and hydro Several assembly members expressed support for tidal, wave and sometimes hydro in particular: “I prefer tidal, wave and hydro as they are renewable as well” “Tidal and Wave should be considered more.” “Money used for Nuclear should be transferred to Wave and Tidal development. I think it’s crazy we are spending so much money on a hazardous energy when we can essentially power the UK on clean safe renewables.” “I think tidal and wave power are worth more consideration – they are natural resources like the wind and sun, but whilst the last two are variable according to the weather, tides and wave power are a constant and powerful source of energy.” “…consideration should be given to tidal and wave technology. These could be operated in conjunction with offshore wind installations.” “Tidal, wave & hydro needs to be developed since as an island we need to take advantage of that...initially it will be expensive but hopefully will become more competitive compared to other forms of production.” “As we are an island I thought more would have been made of both tidal and wave power generation. I understand they may be more expensive but so was wind power in the beginning.” “Given we are an island, with access to our coastline no greater than 70–80 miles from anywhere in the UK, shouldn’t we be looking at wave/tidal energy especially for communities that rely on oil for heating and/or are not attached to the national grid.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  411  Individual assembly members made the following points: “I like all these options a lot, they all provide very clean energy. I think that all forms of clean energy should be used in the areas they are applicable.” “These should also be considered as they are also minimally detrimental to the environment” “All these types are currently quite expensive but I believe, as with everything, the more people adopt them and the more research is done, the cheaper they will become. I like the idea of all of these technologies especially Hydro and Tidal/Wave and would like to see them implemented in some capacity in the future.”  Cons Unproven Some assembly members said that these technologies are “interesting but relatively unproven” or “all largely untested and would require significant investment.” Some suggested that the “technology for some of these may not be so mature.”  Too slow Linked to the above, one assembly member said that “time is a major factor”, suggesting that “we need to prioritise technologies that are already established and proven, and not on tidal, wave, etc.”  Conditions Protect the environment “I think there is a small place for all of these but with stringent controls. The natural environment, wildlife and biodiversity should always be considered and given priority. A decommissioned nuclear plant on the coast, which has already had its environment devastated, could be a consideration for tidal or wave power and once in place the environment vastly improved and enhanced.” Another assembly members said that “the environmental impacts of these schemes must be properly assessed.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  412  Continue research and development Some assembly said that we should “continue to investigate these other options as the reduction of climate change is as important as apparently high financial cost. “ Others said “if they can be shown to work in reducing global warming, they should be tried” or they “…nee[d] to be researched more and will play [a] part in the future.” Some assembly members said “tidal and wave are being tried, but need more research to scale up” or “tidal and wave technologies seem like good options for an Island nation like the UK, but I think there needs to be more investment and incentives to continue R&D in these areas.”  Develop storage options “Other technologies such as wave and tidal would be good options for the UK especially, but only if we would be able to store the power and transport it/use it at a later time.”  Work together internationally Some assembly said we need to “work internationally and exchange research programmes especially with countries with similar geographic and geological terrains” or suggested that “with emerging existing technologies an international effort would yield greater results.” Some assembly members commented that it is “important to look at international collaboration regarding all these different technologies and their use in the best geographical locations”, particularly if “we can invest further in, and make use of, more efficient emerging technologies available to transfer electricity in a suitable way….”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  413  Promote local energy Some assembly members suggested that “the government should look at options to create more energy locally than nationally” or that “devolution is required for local government to take advantage of localised energy generation.” Some gave the example of Southampton, which “can use geothermal as it suits their geography.”  Individual assembly members suggested that “study of the estimated efficiency should be the key factor to what technology needs to be chosen in every case”, that technologies should be considered “only if they contribute to reducing [the] domestic cost of energy to the consumer” or that “we have to look at the resources available here in the UK, costs and long term sustainability.” Another assembly member said it “would [be] great if technology could harness both wind and hydro power in the same unit.” Some assembly members suggested that another technology, hydrogen, was the “way forward.”  C.2 Hydro The assembly members who commented on hydro specifically mostly made positive comments:   General support – “I love the idea for hydro … where it is possible”    Suitability for the UK or particular local areas – one assembly member said “I’ve seen and am very impressed with the micro-hydro scheme at Old Walls near Widecombe in the Moor. This scheme generated about 400 MWh/year of electricity, equivalent to the energy consumption of about 90 homes. These could be promoted in many, many villages around the country with moorland and hillside stream run-off. With surpluses feed back to the grid to offset maintenance. Need to overcome established planning regulation – i.e. reason for saying no!” Others said more generally that hydro has “a bigger part to play in local areas where the location would allow these technologies to thrive.”  One assembly member voiced a concern about hydro, suggesting that it “may need the building of dams resulting in loss of land.”  C.3 Wave Assembly members who commented on wave technology specifically all made positive comments:   General support – “would love to see wave tech develop”    Combine with offshore wind – one assembly member said “I believe wave energy is seriously under utilized in offshore wind farms. Having fixed pillars in the sea provides the basis for utilizing vertical oscillations (wave energy) for effectively unlimited energy generation.” Another assembly made a similar point: “If we’re building offshore turbines which are fixed to the seabed, why not attach wave turbines to these?”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  414  C.4 Tidal Assembly members who commented on tidal technology specifically mostly made positive comments:   General support – some assembly members expressed general support. One said they “really feel that Tidal is a possible way to look. I know it isn’t cheap but the more it’s invested in the cheaper it should get like solar/electric cars.... Hopefully it’s something we start to see being talked about more.” Another said “I feel tidal should be backed more”, a third that “[I am] quite interested in tidal technology”;    Suitability for the UK – some assembly members said “as we are an island, it makes sense to continue to look into tidal generation... As this would be a consistent source of energy” or that “I think serious consideration needs to take place on British estuaries to establish whether tidal power can be harnessed”;    Better than nuclear – “I would prefer tidal to nuclear, if the construction costs were comparable, as it’s less risky and requires less future maintenance”;    Local potential – “Tidal …[has] a bigger part to play in local areas where the location would allow these technologies to thrive i.e. Swansea tidal lagoon…”;    Stable supply – “Tidal systems in the right places would give a regular twice a day power generation and as the tide varies around the coast some could be working while others are not – wave generation depends on the wind to create the waves so you might as well use wind power.”  Some assembly members said there were points they disliked about tidal or were unsure about: Not sure tidal is a great idea as it can affect nearby wildlife and [has] very expensive “ start up costs.”  “ Tidal may be expensive to set up and not provide enough energy.” “ Tidal would generate immense energy, but it’s intermittent, and is not convenient” One assembly member “this [can] be taken to other areas beyond the Severn? Would want to make a judgement and would need to know about cost and [the] impact on [the] marine environment, but interested.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  415  C.5 Geothermal Only a small number of assembly members commented specifically on geothermal. Most comments were positive:   General support – some assembly members said “I love the idea for … geothermal energy production where it is possible” or that “geothermal could be a good option”;    Proven and low impact – one assembly member said that “geothermal for me is the way forward. UK currently using it [in] Southampton – drilling only 1800 down so not impacting the earth’s crust and [it provides an] endless supply of heat energy…”;    Good for some areas – one assembly member said it could have a “bigger part to play in local areas where the location would allow [it] … to thrive.”  One assembly member expressed doubts, suggesting that “geothermal could possibly release more CO2 into the atmosphere.”  D. Cross-cutting considerations Assembly members’ ballot papers gave them the opportunity to add ‘anything else’ they wanted to say about where our electricity comes from. Some assembly members used this space to make additional comments about individual technologies, in which case their thoughts have been incorporated into the tables above. Others however made cross-cutting points. Some assembly members noted the need to pursue a combination of technologies. Some made general comments, saying “I think we should use a mixture of them”, “I feel that all options presented/discussed should be considered as a combination to get the best from each option”, or “I don’t think that one option is a ‘cure all’ however I feel that a combination of the options would allow us to bring net zero much closer to becoming a reality.” Others’ made more specific suggestions or included key factors they would want borne in mind: I think we should provide most of it by offshore (e.g. 55%), then 30% by both solar and “ onshore (15% each), then provide a base load through nuclear (10%) and finally the remaining 5% could come from bioenergy, wave and maybe tidal. Also I believe there should be ways to transport electricity from one part of the country to the other so that if it’s extremely windy in one part of the country and not the other then the electricity supply will remain balanced.” options should exist symbiotically and constant sources like nuclear and bioenergy “ All are necessary to supplement variable sources like wind. Ultimately using variables will change to way we consume electricity (as a service – using it when it’s windy is cheaper) making us more flexible as a society.” I don’t think any one option is the solution, they all have their strengths and weaknesses, “ therefore we should use a few different solutions together. I do believe that we should move away from fossil fuels entirely, we will run out eventually anyway if we keep consuming them at the rate we are….”  “ The UK should aim for a combination of low risk low impact technologies.” Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  416  It cannot be a singular solve-all solution, different communities will be able to harness “ and use different types of electricity.”  “ It needs to be a mixture. Not reliant on one source – different for homes than industry.” enough thought has gone into integrated energy production. So for example, “ INotbelieve the UK should concentrate on offshore energy production with energy plants simultaneously taking advantage of wind, solar and wave energy and using this unlimited energy to produce synthetic fuels at source from air mining. The energy plants could be static (akin to oil platforms in the North Sea)… or floating vessels much like ocean going fuel tankers, albeit that floating vessels would be less efficient at capturing wave energy.” Some assembly members stressed the need to keep our options open and/or conduct further analysis, including looking a new technologies. Comments included: I think the UK should keep its options open. When it chooses an option it should do a cost “ benefit analysis (if it can) on each technology. I don’t know if this is possible but could two small projects be compared when a new option is considered?” Lets keep our options open and look at new energies. If we have come this far there “ must be more we can do. Capturing cow methane? More use of waste from household for energy? Hydrogen?”  “ Continue to research and utilise advancing technologies. pros and cons should be constantly under review. We must have a holistic view “ The of what is good for the planet as well as humanity.” Others said there should be a focus on storage solutions for variable energy: I think the main thing is to find a way to store the power created from wind turbines, “ solar panels, etc. so it doesn’t go to waste and we can use it efficiently.” variable amounts of energy produced by wind & solar, energy storage will “ beDuekey.to the While the production of batteries has an environmental impact there are other energy storage options that we need to invest in as well. This includes pumping water and lifting weights to store energy when we have an excess [and] … to generate energy when we have drop in supply. This will be key to invest in while also rapidly scaling up our onshore and offshore wind capacity.” like to see electricity storage technology developed. So that the excess generation “ ofI would electricity can be stored.” Some assembly members felt is “important to differentiate the renewable energy with no waste product to the low carbon alternatives that may create a potential problem for the future generations.” Similar comments included: “if we can achieve net zero and produce the energy we need without having to resort to technologies that have a waste product at the end of it why risk it no matter how small the risk….” or “the generating of electricity which leaves waste, nuclear or stored carbon, for future generations is irresponsible. “ Some assembly members highlighted the principles or criteria that they felt should underpin how the UK generates its electricity. Some assembly members said it is “important to consider  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  417  costs and effects to the environment”, or that “achieving net zero is pretty pointless if you’re going to wreck the environment with nuclear or fracking”, while others cautioned “think carefully about risks to people. Not all about costs.” Some suggested “we should be investing in tech we already have in order to meet our targets on time”, or that we should “utilise the science we have and know works on a national scale rather than methods still being tested or [that have]… no real life evidence (e.g. CCS on a national scale).” Others said we should “prioritise resources we have, not resources which have to be imported.” Other suggestions included: way forward should be based on the principles broadly agreed to in week one. This “ The situation is a unique opportunity to reconfigure not only our energy systems but also our human inter-reaction with our environment and fellow human kind. An unseemly rush to get back to business as usual will be catastrophic for generations to come.” concerned about our energy security considering a lot of our generating capacity “ isI am owned by foreign (often state controlled) companies. I think all the nuclear power capacity is owned by EDF for example, and wind power contracts in Scotland all seem to benefit Denmark’s Ørsted, Sweden’s Vattenfall, China’s Red Rock and France’s EDF, as well as some German state-owned installations. The transition to renewables needs to have UK societal and economic benefits as well as environmental.” I would like to see the energy produced in the UK and creating jobs for employees most “ affected by energy production change.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  418  price of electricity does not matter so long as it is a similar price as our competitors “ The so it does not put our manufacturing at a disadvantage and it is a level playing field against other European countries.” benefits, pros/cons of all options need to be highlighted and documented “ Cost, leading to end user fair and affordable outlays.” Some assembly members said “we should look at usage and ways to reduce it”: are two fundamental ways to reduce our emissions. The first is by switching “ There to renewable energy sources, however this has costs and takes time. The second is by reducing our energy demand. And we will need to do both to meet our targets. Reducing our energy demand is the quickest, easiest, and cheapest way to reduce our carbon emissions. Reducing our energy demand while quickly transitioning to already existing widely-scalable clean renewable energy (such as wind) will allow us to get to net zero quickly and cost-effectively.” Relatedly, others noted that “the choice of which generating technology to choose and at what level is to some extent dependant on how electricity is used. For example if we had many more electric vehicles, there would be greater potential for off peak usage and more available battery storage and this would get over some of the disadvantages of solar and wind generation.” Individual assembly members said that “commercial interests should be managed within national interests e.g. potentially renationalise”, or asked “are Hydrogen power plants an option?”  Conclusions Assembly members expressed clear preferences for how the UK should generate its electricity. Large majorities of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that three ways of generating electricity should be part of how the UK gets to net zero:   Offshore wind (95%);    Solar power (81%);    Onshore wind (78%).  Onshore wind scored slightly more highly than solar power in the Borda count, suggesting that assembly members slightly preferred it to solar power overall. Assembly members identified multiple points that they liked about each of these technologies. Overall, they tended to see wind-based options as suitable for the UK, low cost, proven, clean, and good for the economy and jobs, among other advantages. They saw offshore wind as having key additional benefits, particularly being “out of the way”, but also in terms of the space available for turbines and its minimal impact on wildlife. For solar power, assembly members listed a wide range of positives including flexibility of location, the potential for individual autonomy and profit, and the recognised, proven and clean nature of the technology.  Climate Assembly UK ― Where our electricity comes from  419  For all three ways of generating electricity, assembly members suggested a range of points to bear in mind around implementation. Assembly members also discussed and listed their dislikes about offshore wind, onshore wind and solar. However they overwhelmingly felt that the advantages outweighed these points. Assembly members were much less supportive of bioenergy, nuclear and fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage – although, particularly for bioenergy, significant numbers of assembly members were unsure about its use:   40% of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that bioenergy should be part of how the UK gets to net zero, 36% were ‘unsure’, and 24% ‘strongly disagreed’ or ‘disagreed’;    The equivalent figures for nuclear were 34%, 18% and 46%;    For fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage the results were 22%, 22% and 56%; a majority of assembly members ‘disagreed’ or ‘strongly disagreed’ that this way of generating electricity should be part of how the UK gets to net zero.  Assembly members’ comments on bioenergy suggest that, for many, their view would depend on how it is produced, including what is being burnt, how production is regulated, and therefore what the environmental and CO2 impacts are. Some assembly members said they also found the evidence on bioenergy hard to follow. Assembly members’ dislikes about bioenergy included concerns around burning trees and crops, land use and environmental effects, and a feeling that better alternatives exist. Assembly members had three main concerns around nuclear: its cost, safety, and issues around waste storage and decommissioning. Their dislikes of fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage centred on safety risks and the continued use of fossil fuels, with assembly members also suggesting that it only provides a “short-term”, expensive solution, when better alternatives are available. Assembly members did not hear detailed evidence about tidal, wave, hydro and geothermal technologies, but in principle many clearly felt positive about their use particularly in suitable local areas. Assembly members tended to be most positive about tidal and wave technologies, followed by hydro. They saw these as natural and logical given that the UK is an island, also suggesting that they could be combined with offshore wind. As with the other technologies, assembly members noted a range of conditions for decision-makers to bear in mind around their implementation.

Assembly members also set out a number of conditions around their implementation, including that it was planned and managed well (for example, planting the right trees in the right places), support for farmers, sustainability, and ensuring a balance of land use.  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  4 Assembly members were less supportive of Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) and Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS). Only 42% of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that each of these methods should be part of how the UK gets to net zero, while 36% (BECCS) and 39% (DACCS) ‘strongly disagreed’ or ‘disagreed’. Common concerns about BECCS and DACCS included the potential for leaks from carbon storage sites and a feeling that they failed to address the problem, including a risk that they are “treated as [a] magic solution” that “takes the focus off the amount that we are emitting in the first place.” Assembly members also saw these methods, particularly DACCS, as being less natural, costly and unproven in terms of the technology they require. 5 Whilst BECCS and DACCS received limited support, some assembly members were keen that further research and development took place, noting for example that these technologies could perhaps then be used more in the future or that they might be needed to “mop up” remaining CO2.  423  Greenhouse gas removals Achieving the UK’s net zero climate change target by 2050 necessitates reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible. However reducing emissions alone will not be enough. By the middle of this century some emissions will still remain. For the themes considered by Climate Assembly UK, this is particularly true of air travel and farming. The assembly’s recommendations in these areas suggest remaining C02 emissions by 2050 of between 45–55 million tonnes per year. That compares to emissions of 366 million tonnes in 2018.1 At the penultimate assembly weekend, assembly members considered how best to remove these remaining emissions from the atmosphere.  What did the assembly consider? All assembly members heard evidence, deliberated and voted on the question of how best to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. They heard about six potential removal methods:2  1 2  1.  Forests and better forest management  2.  Restoring and managing peatlands and wetlands  3.  Enhancing the storage of carbon in the soil  4.  Using wood in construction  5.  Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS)  6.  Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage  https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/863325/2018final-emissions-statistics-summary.pdf The Expert Leads explained to assembly members that there are other methods of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. These additional methods are currently more speculative; more work needs to be done to enable them to be used at scale and to ensure that the risks associated with them can be managed properly.  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  424  The evidence session covered what these methods are and different views on their desirability. Assembly members had the opportunity to question each speaker3 in detail. After the evidence session, assembly members discussed the six methods. They then voted on them by secret ballot.  What’s included in this chapter? Assembly members had less time overall to discuss ‘removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere’ than they had for the themes covered in previous chapters, with the exception of ‘where our electricity comes from’. They therefore focussed on just one question: which of six greenhouse gas removal methods should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. This chapter presents their views in the following order: A.  Vote results: the assembly’s final recommendations on which of the six greenhouse gas removal methods should be part of how the UK gets to net zero;  B.  Rationale and conditions: assembly members’ rationale for their votes, as well as areas they would like to see considered around the implementation of each of the six methods;  C.  Cross-cutting considerations: points emphasised by assembly members when looking back across all six options at the end of their discussions.  The chapter ends by summarising the conclusions from across these sections.  Contents of this chapter A. Votes results B.

Cross-cutting considerations  page 479  Conclusions  page 481  The assembly heard from three speakers on removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere: Chris Stark, Committee on Climate Change (informant); Bill Spence, independent (advocate); Dr Douglas Parr, Greenpeace (advocate). All speakers’ presentations are available as slides, videos and transcripts at climateassembly.uk/resources/. An ‘informant’ is a speaker who we asked to cover the range of views and available evidence on a topic. An ‘advocate’ is a speaker who we asked to give their own view, or the view of their organisation. Assembly members knew whether speakers were informants or advocates.  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  425  A. Vote results Assembly members voted on ways of removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere by secret ballot. There were two different ballot papers. The first ballot paper asked assembly members how much they agreed or disagreed that each method should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. The second ballot paper asked them to rank the methods in their order of preference. The votes from this second ballot paper were counted in two ways:   Counting assembly members’ first preference votes only.    Using Borda count. This involves allocating points for preferences – a first preference vote scored five points, a second preference vote four points and so on. A sixth preference vote scored no points. Counting the votes like this tells us which methods are most acceptable to the greatest number of assembly members. This is particularly useful for this question, where it is likely that more than one way of removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere will be needed.  More than 50% of assembly members ‘agreed’ or ‘strongly agreed’ that four of the methods should be part of how the UK gets to net zero. These were forests and better forest management (99%), restoring and managing peatlands and wetlands (85%), using wood in construction (82%) and enhancing the storage of carbon in the soil (62%). Of these four methods, assembly members were:   Most supportive of forests and better forest management, with 81% ‘strongly agreeing’ with its use and no assembly members ‘disagreeing’ or ‘strongly disagreeing’;    Least sure about enhancing the storage of carbon in the soil. A number of assembly members raised concerns that they didn’t fully understand how this option worked. This could have increased the number of assembly members saying they were unsure. Assembly members also noted points that this disliked about this option (see Section B).  In comparison to the first four methods, BECCS and DACCS saw much lower levels of agreement – 42% each. They also saw higher levels of disagreement, with 36% (BECCS) and 39% (DACCS) of assembly members ‘disagreeing’ or ‘strongly disagreeing’ that they should be part of the path to net zero.

Forests and better forest management remained assembly members’ preferred option, receiving 83% of first preference votes. It was again followed by restoring and managing peatlands and wetlands, using wood in construction, and enhancing the storage of carbon in the soil, in that order. As with the first vote, BECCS and DACCS scored less well, with the former scoring slightly higher than the latter. Some assembly members commented that they would have liked more information about all six methods, expressing “a desire to be able to quantify things either by land area or investment cost needed to achieve the removal of one tonne of CO2.”4 Some also commented in relation to DACCS that they didn’t “see how we can make a decision on it, when so little is known.”  B. Rationale and conditions This section contains:   The reasons that sit behind assembly members’ votes, as just reported;    ‘Conditions’ that some assembly members felt would support the use of each method or that they suggested should be in place for it to be used.  Given the detailed nature of assembly members’ comments, we have categorised the pros and cons for each of way removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere under six headings:   Environment impact and land use;    Practicality, efficiency, readiness and scale;    Costs, the economy and jobs;    Public support;    Safety and risk;    Other.  The category titles are our words, not assembly members’, and are just there to make assembly members’ thoughts easier to navigate. All the content under the headings is however assembly members’ own. We have kept in contradictory opinions in order to show the full range of views amongst assembly members. The results of the votes above tell you what conclusions assembly members reached having considered all these points, and the weight of feeling in support (or not) of each way of removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.  4  Assembly members heard evidence about the relative cost of the different methods. It was not possible to give them the more precise figures requested because there are a range of plausible costs for direct CO2 removal methods. Methods also carry a variety of wider costs and benefits that hinder simple cost comparisons.  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  429  B.1 Forests and better forest management Forests and better forest management refers to planting and managing forests. These absorb carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. Assembly members discussed this option in small groups, noting pros and cons.  Pros Assembly members identified the following areas as points that they liked about forests and better forest management.  Environment impact and land use A large number of assembly members described forests and better forest management as “natural”, “very natural”, “more natural”, “nature first”, “working with a natural way” or the “most natural way of solving the problem.” Some said “we would like to start with natural processes”, that “[we are] all for nature based approaches” or that it’s the “best solution as [it is] given by nature.” Others commented that the “problem is a man-made one, [it] should have natural solutions” or that we “will need some man made interventions but more natural is better.” Some felt that “all of the nature ones [greenhouse gas removal methods] made sense to do all together” or that it’s “naturally there, there’s already forests growing so to continue this makes sense.” Some assembly members commented that we are “seeing with covid-19 that nature is coming back when humans step back … skies are clearer and birds are singing and maybe it’s a wakeup call.” Others said a “more holistic approach [is] needed to help the planet heal – forests are part of the ecosystem and we are integrated with that too.” Another large number of assembly members suggested that this greenhouse gas removal method would have “multiple benefits” “other benefits”, or that there’s a “double benefit of bringing in more forests”. Almost all these assembly members said their comments related to one or more of the points covered in the rest of this subsection. Some assembly members suggested forests and better forest management are “good for wildlife”, “encourage wildlife”, would bring “increased biodiversity”, or that “when well located [forests] can have additional biodiversity benefits.” Similar points included that they provide “natural habitat for a lot of animals”, “enhance habitats for biodiversity” or that a forest “takes 10 years to grow, 100 years to [reach] maturity so [you] get 90 years of them taking in carbon and in that 90 years it’s offering habitat for animals.” Other assembly members commented that “humans have damaged the environment significantly, we need to restore natural habits whilst helping the environment.” Some felt it would be “good for native trees” or “improves nature.” Some assembly members made more general points, saying forests and better forest management have “good overall environmental impacts” or that they would be good for the “ecosystem.” Others said we “can integrate animals in [the] forest (for agriculture) and provide a mixed and balanced ecosystem” or that they wanted to “restore natural forests.” For some assembly members it was important that forests “help reduce flooding”, provide “flood protection”, or are a “flood defence.” Others noted they “potentially [have]…knock on effects re flood management.” Some said they “provide shading” or “provide shelter in hot climates.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  430  Some assembly members talked about a “mental health/wellbeing value – people can clear their heads when they walk through a forest.” Some commented that it’s “nicer to live in an area with trees”, that they would be “happy to have forests next to me” or that they “like it on face value, I like the countryside, nature and going for walks.” Others talked about “enjoyment, joy from forests” or said “at least no one will be offended by it.” Some suggested that “reforestation can increase local amenity e.g. nature walks etc.” Some assembly members suggested that “once planted [a forest] doesn’t take any energy”, that it “doesn’t use electricity” or that it has a “smaller carbon footprint to implement than building CCS technology.” Some said it is a “good use of land that appears to have significant carbon capture impacts per area of land compared to other natural options.”  Practicality, efficiency, readiness and scale Some assembly members felt that forests and better forest management combine well with other greenhouse gas removal methods. Some assembly members suggested they “could be used as part of a natural cycle, in combination with building materials or bioenergy”, or similarly that “trees, when they have reached their useful carbon capture life can be used for biofuels or for building (dual benefits).” Some assembly members made similar points or talked about other ways forests and better forest management could be used: + Construction and manufacture – some said it could be used to “supply wood to use in construction”, or that the wood could be “used for housing or furniture.” Others said “we shouldn’t just look at buildings for construction, what about wooden street signs etc”; + Education – some noted the “need to cut down and replenish [forests]” and suggested that this could be linked to “school initiatives: extracurricular activities – would be great to see more of it here in the UK – [there is an] example in Poland”; + BECCS – some suggested that “material cleared during forest management can be used for biofuels (without growing crops specifically for this)” or that “this option is not isolated from the other land-use options, they’re linked, e.g. management of forests can be used to generate biomass.” For some assembly members forests and better forest management are a “good option for the UK – we have a lot of space for forests and tree planting....” Others felt “we have the space to do it particularly in [the] north of England and Scotland”, that “small farms could be used for planting” or that we “can make better use of land.” Some said “only 5% of land is needed to do enough of this – that’s not a lot.” A number of assembly members felt it would be “easy to do”, the “easiest to execute” or suggested that it can be “easily multiplied and repeated around the country”, with others labelling it “achievable.” Some liked that it “doesn’t rely on new technology”, “doesn’t need too much technology” or “avoids emphasis on tech answers which may be being pushed more than appropriate to keep ‘big boys’ in jobs.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  431  A number of assembly members noted that “we know it works” or that “trees are good at removing CO2 – it’s a proven method.” Others suggested that it is efficient, saying it “stores lots of carbon.” Some assembly members said “it takes the CO2 out straight away” or that we “can achieve [it] quickly.” Others disagreed, saying “it’s obviously important [and] worthwhile but [it’s] a long-term solution.”  Costs, the economy and jobs Some assembly members said forests and better forest management would be “low cost”, “cheapest”, “cost effective” or that they “could be upscaled relatively cheaply and quickly.” One said they’re “low cost, and will make an impact so [we] might as well.” Another suggested they’re “cheap and could be income generating.” Some assembly members suggested forests “attract tourists (e.g. Lake District)”, or that they are “good for access for people – they can go and use the forest, means more leisure activities available, good for [the] local economy.” Others said it “makes money for the country”, or that “forestry can bring jobs as well.”  Public support Some assembly members talked about the “aesthetics of forests” saying that “trees and forests are beautiful.” Others contrasted forests to the other options noting that “with bioenergy and CCS, it’s more infrastructure (i.e. ugly buildings).” Some said they “like the idea of new forests and trees where not planted before”, that we “wouldn’t exist without trees” or that they are a “fan of trees – suggest encouraging landowners to give over [a] % of their land to trees.” One assembly member said it “brings people closer to nature.” Another commented that “where I am from, where my family is from, on the continent, tree planting has always been part of our daily lives – you put it in, you take it out – it’s a green option.”  Safety and risk No assembly members made comments in this area.  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  432  Other Some assembly members stated they are “all for it”, or that it’s “very important – it’s a major part of the solution i.e. whether that be in conjunction with BECCS or direct air capture for example.” Others said it’s a “win-win” with “a few niggles but overall a good idea.” Some commented that they were “not sure why it’s not at the top of the agenda, there’s literally no bad point to it”, or that “as long as [it’s] not impacting wildlife, what’s bad about planting more trees.” Some assembly members expressed scepticism about suggested downsides, saying it’s “been mentioned that one of the cons is that this method takes up land that could be used for other uses such as crops, farming, but that’s not much of an argument especially when we’re encouraging people to eat less meat and have fewer cows in fields.” Others said it’s “better to do something rather than nothing, so [we] should pursue this.” Some assembly members said it “seems like common sense”, is a “no-brainer” or “should be happening irrespective of other solutions.” A number of assembly members said they felt it was a “global solution – planting trees anywhere on the planet has benefits for all” or should be a “global effort not just the UK.” Some commented that “other areas in the world where we can plant trees could further increase the forest mass around the world.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  433  Cons Assembly members identified the following areas as points that they disliked about forests and better forest management.  Environment impact and land use A number of assembly members suggested forests and forest management might not be that effective. Some said we “mustn’t be naïve about how much carbon a tree can remove – it can only do so much” or it “doesn’t take all carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.” Others noted it “takes 10 years for them to start absorbing CO2 and the tree becomes less productive at 100 years.” Some questioned “how much difference will it really make?” or felt it wouldn’t work long-term, noting “presenters said trees store carbon for decades, but this is not a decade’s problem, it’s a longer problem.” Others suggested that “if the trees are cut down and burned this could have the reverse effect on CO2 levels”, while some branded it “carbon ‘relocation’ rather than storage – the carbon will be released at some point....” Some assembly members warned that we need to “be careful about [the] impact on wildlife” or the “impacts of non-native tree planting on biodiversity” including “for native trees.” Others said that the “10 year optimum turnaround for forest trees before harvesting” was a concern “because of habitat and biodiversity impacts.” Some suggested that there could “perhaps [be a] loss of biodiversity.” One assembly member highlighted the potential “health impacts on people of non-native planting e.g. allergens.”  Practicality, efficiency, readiness and scale Some assembly members asked “where are we going to get sufficient land from? “, or commented “[I am] unsure whether we have enough space to accommodate new forest… So much green space and farmland is lost to roads and housing where I live.” Others questioned whether there was ”enough available / suitable land for it to make a real difference in the UK (particularly in the south)”, saying we “are a small country” and “5% feels like a lot of land.” Others said it “won’t be the ‘one big solution’ – needs too much land.” Relatedly, some assembly members worried about the “impact on other land use.” Some commented that “there need to be options other than using the land we need for growing food”, or that we “could use land for other uses e.g. crops or biofuels etc” or “wind”. Some assembly members asked “how scalable is it?” or suggested it has “limited capacity” because we can “only [have a] certain amount of trees.” For some assembly members there were other questions around feasibility. They asked “who will be prepared to give up land?” and “who will pay for the land?”. Others said “there have been plans to plant more trees in the past and nothing has happened. Don’t want to put a lot of money into something that doesn’t end up happening.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  434  A number of assembly members said it “takes a long time for them [trees] to grow and [we] need to grow a lot of them.” Others said it “takes time before we see benefits” or we are “racing against the clock, so need [a] more aggressive solution.” Similarly, some assembly members commented that “trees take a long time to grow… [that means we] need something else as well – think need all the options to contribute.”  Costs, the economy and jobs One assembly member asked “how much will it cost?”5  Public support No assembly members made comments in this area.  Safety and risk No assembly members made comments in this area.  Conditions Some assembly members noted conditions around the use forests and better forest management – points they felt would aid its implementation or that should be put in place. They suggested a need to:  Get the legislation right Assembly members made comments including: “We were told the law surrounding protecting tees is really weak, which means any developer can cut down any amount of trees unless it’s a special tree, so we need stronger legislation that protects trees and forests to enable this approach to work.” “Don’t know if there’s a regulatory body that has an overview of all the forests but need one to ensure things are done correctly.” “There’s a clear role for government to make sure that whatever is decided about forests sticks.” It “needs to be set in law if it is to work.”  5  Assembly members heard evidence about the relative cost of the different methods. It was not possible to give them the more precise figures requested because there are a range of plausible costs for direct CO2 removal methods. Methods also carry a variety of wider costs and benefits that hinder simple cost comparisons.  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  435  Plant the right trees, in the right places Some assembly members said they were happy with this idea as long as it’s the “right kind of trees in [the] right places.” For some this meant “as long as there is biodiversity” or as long as “it enhance[s] local areas and biodiversity.” Specific comments included: → “Difficult to convince people to not just plant miles of spruce as need a variety of hard and softwood trees – need natural biodiversity”; → “Need to plant the right type of trees – there was an issue in Scotland where they planted a lot of evergreen trees which made a very dark woodland and they ended up having to chop it down and replace with deciduous”; → “Best types of trees for carbon capture are the fast growing ones – but they are not always native. Important to not bring [in] non-native species.” → Non-native trees can harm “both the visual [appeal]… of an area as well as local habitats”; → “Must be done with consideration to the wildlife”; → Some assembly members put forward a potential solution: “Local groups safeguarding specific forests encourages buy-in, makes sure things are done well and also focuses on protecting biodiversity rather than a large developer with an interest in just sequestering carbon alone. … local groups would … have a vested interest in the biodiversity of the area and help manage it better.” Others noted the need to think about what is planted where for other reasons: “Mustn’t impact on land use too much / need to find the right locations.” “It would be better to use less productive land, land that wouldn’t be used for crops.” “Must be managed alongside farming.” Some said we should “grow fast-growing trees which are useful.”  Plan properly and manage forests well Related to the above some assembly members noted that “a proviso is tree planting can be done badly so need to have a plan to ensure it’s done properly and work on tree management.” Specific comments from assembly members included: → We need “careful management as concerned about the space”; → “There needs to be management in the sense of risk of wildfires – sensible barriers in place to mitigate this”; → “All these systems have to work together. If you have a forest, you need to manage it. Some of the wood could be useful for composting or biomass – all the systems have to gel, work together to be effective.” Others suggested we “[u]se the trees for construction, but fell them in a good way that doesn’t damage wildlife” or that it “needs more emphasis on using wood for house building.” Others disagreed saying “[w]e should also protect trees more, ie not cut them down for buildings etc”;  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  436  → “Better forest management [is] essential to knowing when and how to use trees (e.g. when to cut down).” It “needs to be done properly to be efficient” and we need to “make sure [we are] thinning trees effectively.”  Think about what mature trees are used for Some assembly members said that support was “conditional on what trees are used for when they reac[h] their carbon capture maturity” with some strongly opposing any use for bioenergy. Others felt we should “use the wood” and not “waste” it, with some suggesting we “use the wood for building so it doesn’t release the CO2 so fast.”  Combine it with other options Some assembly members said it “needs to be done with other things”, that it’s a “brilliant thing to do but not enough on it’s own” and that it “isn’t enough on its own but is a starting point.” Specific comments included: → It “makes the most sense when combined with peatlands/wetlands and soil options as it allows land to be used to capture carbon in the best way in each place”; → “It “should not be an either/or alternative” – we “need to consider a hybrid solution between the 6 options…”; → “Not as much of an impact as BECCS – can’t solve the issue on it’s own”; → We “may need to use other less natural models to address carbon levels in the short term – could revert to these more natural processes later down the line?” → “Option a) is only my favourite if it [is] used to support options d) [using wood in construction] and e) [BECCS].”  Win support, including through incentives Some assembly members said this “needs the support of landowners”, while others suggested that “we need to entice anyone with any land, no matter how small, to plant trees.” Some assembly members asked: “Forests aren’t seen as progress, is that why it’s less appealing to policy-makers? This option needs to be packaged in a way that’s more positive.” One assembly member said it would be important to “make sure that farmers are not pushed out or demonised (can do this with grants for farmers).”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  437  Protect jobs and incomes Some assembly members said we need to assess the potential “job creation benefit…. if forests are planted on former farmland, which may reduce jobs overall.” Others said that “farmers need compensation for lost income.”  Start now Some assembly members suggested that we “need to start doing it now as [it] takes at least 10 years.” Others suggested that we could “start by not cutting down existing trees.”  Other assembly members asked whether “land-use [can] be combined, for example can trees be grown spread out over a large area of land?” and whether “hedges store carbon too?” Others suggested that this “needs to be co-ordinated nationally” and “must be combined with putting less emissions into the atmosphere.” Some assembly members mentioned a need to look at forests abroad too “e.g. deforestation in Brazil, not enough international pressure to stop that but that’s the only way for them to make money – need to support them in other ways.” As seen in Section A, assembly members expressed very strong support for forests and better forest management in their votes.  B.2 Restoring and managing peatlands and wetlands Restoring and managing peatlands and wetlands refers to restoring or managing some naturally wet areas of land so that they absorb more carbon dioxide. Assembly members discussed this option in small groups, noting pros and cons.  Pros Assembly members identified the following areas as points that they liked about restoring and managing peatlands and wetlands.  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  438  Environment impact and land use A significant number of assembly members said restoring and managing peatlands and wetlands would “protect against flooding”, “aids with flood protection”, “could help to prevent flooding if maintained correctly” or is a “flood defence.” Others said it “holds back water to stop flooding” or that it “will abate a lot of the flooding (of which there has been an increase over the last few years) and will stop this in high risk areas.” Some assembly members suggested particular benefits for coastal areas, suggesting that “when done in coastal areas [it] can help with flooding” or it’s “beneficial for coastal erosion and flood planes where it can be a more bog like environment.” Others suggested it would “ensur[e] land is not drained and sold for housing that would create flood risks elsewhere” or that “reducing flood risk / flood management needs” would have “additional economic benefits.” Some assembly members described restoring and managing peatlands and wetlands as “natural”, “a natural solution”, or “part of the natural world.” Some said that they “like nature orientated solution[s]” or that they “trust it more than man-made solutions.” Others commented that “it’s not interfering, it’s more restoring things and removing existing management.” Some said “it speaks to restoring nature.” A number of assembly members talked about the importance of protecting and restoring peatlands and wetlands. Some commented that “peatlands and wetlands have been there for thousands of years – we need to protect them” or that this is a “reason to protect and preserve current wetland areas that may be at threat.” Others suggested that “managing what we have is important” and that we “should be doing it anyway.” Some talked about a “need to stop current destruction of these areas” or said it was “not just a case of restoring wetlands but also keeping the ones that are still there. […] Need legislation to protect the wetlands.” Relatedly, some assembly members liked that it “look[s] after the countryside and wildlife”, or is “good for wildlife”, “good for birds”, or “good for biodiversity.” Some commented that “it maintains the wetlands for wildlife too”, or particularly noted benefits for “moss, frogspawn & heather.” Further comments included: “They are beautiful, a source of nature and wildlife, birds fly in huge flocks, it’s beautiful.” “Peatlands and wetlands have some of the …[highest] levels of biodiversity in the UK so returning these spaces to nature – plants animal/insect species has importance for the wider ecosystem e.g. pollination.” Some assembly members liked a “focus on restoration of peatlands and wetlands to stop further release of CO2 .” Others said that “peatlands and wetlands keep in CO2 which is good. Some commented that there is “good potential for CO2 absorption”, that it “captures CO2” or “enhances storage.” Others said that they “like that it’s a carbon sink – holds carbon better than many other processes” or that it “locks up carbon unless it dries out / burns.” One assembly member described it as “environmentally friendly.” Another said they “prefer forests or growing crops instead BUT disturbing the land is damaging.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  439  Practicality, efficiency, readiness and scale Some assembly members noted that we “have the knowledge and technology to do this” or that we “know how to restore it – unlike man made solutions where we don’t know enough – there’s no risk.” Some assembly members suggested that it is a “good ide[a] where applicable”: “Every option should be used where it will offer the most benefit. For this one if it’s there then yes, retain it and keep it. It’s not applicable to everywhere.” Others said it has “strong potential as part of a mixed approach”, “should be a part of our plans” or that it’s “for a local level rather than at national level – it can only work where they are situated.” One assembly member said it “can be used inland as well as [in] coastal [areas].” Some assembly members commented that we “can start this fast”, that it “seems to be the quickest method that will have an impact” or that it’s “a quick solution, unlike some other measures.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  440  Costs, the economy and jobs Some assembly members felt it would be “good for [the] local economy” or that “there will be jobs in managing these areas.” Some suggested it would be “low cost”, “not high cost” or a “cheap way to store carbon.” Others said that “this appears to be one of the cheapest options to action – can be done very cheaply and offers the most benefits v least cost (apparently).” Other agreed suggesting it has “limited potential on its own– but if you bring this in in conjunction with forestry management then it seems like a really cheap and good way to capture carbon.” Some assembly members suggested it was costly not to protect peatlands and wetlands, saying “the issue is building in these areas and the small number of properties that are there. It’s costly to keep these areas dry, when it would be easier if they were wet.”  Public support Some assembly members suggested that you “could use wetlands for leisure too”, that they are “good for leisure” and provide “good access for people.” Others commented that they are a “nice place to go for a walk – introduce children to wildlife (pond dipping, catching tadpoles…).” One assembly member felt that restoring and managing peatlands and wetlands was a good idea in order “to have an impact on the landscape and farming practices as a signifier of what needs to be done to change our ways of living.”  Safety and risk No assembly members made comments in this area.  Other Some assembly members said it “delivers multiple benefits” or has “lots of benefits.” Some asked “why wouldn’t you want to do it!”, with others describing it as “effective”, a “win-win” or a “no-brainer.” Some assembly members said they were “not sure why we’re not already doing it – doesn’t have any negative effects, is cheap to do, [and] has economic benefits after a certain period of time.” Others commented that it has “no real negatives”, “I like it – it’s not offensive to people”, or that they have “nothing against it.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  441  Cons Assembly members identified the following areas as points that they disliked about restoring and managing peatlands and wetlands.  Environment impact and land use Some assembly members disliked that restoring and managing peatlands and wetlands “takes up a lot of space (land)”, with some suggesting that there is “pressure on land use” or that it “could be a challenge finding adequate land for this.” Others described it as a “waste of land.” Some assembly members said you “lose the land for any other use (except leisure)” or that the “land could be better used for other things e.g. food production.” Other assembly members said “population growth is an issue, which means we need more housing”, that “farming in the fens will be lost” or that we could “grow trees instead.” Further comments included: “Would it mean flooding a lot of fertile areas e.g. around Norfolk, Cambridge? Do we want to abandon crop growing in these areas? Not sure [we] want to flood these areas outright.” “The wetlands can’t be used for anything else, e.g. as opposed to forests. Although it won’t use up much land so it’s not depriving much land from being used in other ways.”  Practicality, efficiency, readiness and scale Assembly members raised two concerns about capacity and scalability: − “Geographical considerations” – a large number of assembly members commented that they were “not sure it [is] scalable”, that it has “limited potential, only some areas of the UK are suitable”, that there are “not many suitable areas” or that there are “limited areas for expansion.” Some said there is a “question of scale – [it is] not a major solution.” While others commented that “Doug [Parr] said there weren’t identified locations”; − “Limited capacity for significant CO2 absorption” – other assembly members said there “were also questions about whether established wetlands would be able to continue to capture more carbon or really just hold onto what they had already absorbed.” Some said “to capture CO2 it must keep growing; what happens when it reaches equilibrium.” Some assembly members summarised by saying you “can only do it in certain areas and those areas might already be done so limited impact.” Staying with concerns about impact, some assembly member expressed scepticism saying it “seems that we just need to keep places wet? Only applies to certain areas of the country – how effective could this be?” or that “it’s nice on the surface, but will it be effective?” Others commented, “good [option]… – how much potential does it have though? How much C02 extraction exactly? If they dry out, what is released?” Relatedly, some assembly members commented that it “can’t be [the] only solution”, that “we’re going to need multiple solutions” or that it’s “not the whole answer, won’t fix the entire problem.” For some assembly members restoring and managing peatlands and wetlands is “limited in where it can happen, [but] they mustn’t be allowed to dry out.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  442  A number of assembly members raised climate- and season-related issues: “Concern about whether we can make sure it doesn’t dry out – would this be more difficult as temperatures rise, harder to keep wet? This may be a bit ‘chicken and egg’.” Similarly, some queried if it was “practical due to global warming”, or noted that “climate change is affecting patterns of rainfall – would it cost to restore/keep areas wet, given that there is likely to be less rain in the future?” Other assembly members suggested that it “can sometimes store carbon in winter but release [it] in summer if it dries out”, or that “in a very hot summer a fire could burn up a lot e.g. what happened in Yorkshire.” Some said that it’s “not viable long term” or that the “science is less certain about long term storage of the CO2.” Some assembly members suggested that there would be “issues with land ownership” although some felt these would be “manageable with incentives”. Others said they were “worried about it being down to landowners to maintain this unless they were given an incentive to look after it” or said they were “not sure it’s practical to enforce land-use changes.” Some assembly members felt it “might be a slow solution – how long would it take to restore damaged areas?”, while others commented that “it will take a long time to see the benefits, we need something faster.” Some compared it to other options, saying the “length of time it takes to form peat: 1 ha of peatland vs. 1 ha of good middle aged forest. […] Quicker to restore a forest, to grow trees than create a new peatland.” Other assembly members disagreed: “Speed isn’t an issue. We have until 2050 to reach net zero. 30 years to put it in place. If trees take 10 years to grow, that’s fine. If these methods last a long time once they’re in place, that’s good.” Individual assembly members raised a number of additional concerns. One said “what will happen to buildings on existing wetlands?” Others worried that “flooding may be an issue, such as the wetlands in Glastonbury” or said “in East Anglia, for example, there isn’t enough water for the new towns which are being developed so I don’t know how there will be enough water to keep the fens wet.” One assembly commented “given it can reach equilibrium, will need to remove peat and then burn it.”  Costs, the economy and jobs Some assembly members said the “cost and effort of land management” was a “downside”, suggesting it was “hard to manage” or that it “sounds like a full time job to manage it.” Others said it was “not a big enough impact to justify the sacrifice of land and the management cost.” Some queried “if it comes down to time, resources and money is it the right … focus? If we have limited resources, we should concentrate on the most cost-effective areas.”  Public support No assembly members made comments in this area.  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  443  Safety and risk Some assembly members expressed concerns about the “releasing of CO2 if the peatland is damaged” suggesting that there is “potential for it to go wrong if one of them dries out a carbon bomb.”  Conditions Some assembly members noted conditions around restoring and managing peatlands and wetlands – points they felt would aid its implementation or that should be put in place. They suggested a need to:  Combine it with other solutions Some assembly members said it “needs to be part of [a] whole package” or “has to be done in combination with other measures.” Others said more specifically that it “would only really make a significant contribution if combined with good practice in forestry and soil storage as different things will only work in different areas” or that we need to “align this with the ‘what we farm’ options and preferences.” One assembly member commented: “Peatlands and wetlands are an important investment that must be protected and expanded wherever possible. However, given that we only have a small amount of space suitable for peatlands and wetlands overall, we must also implement all other natural carbon capture solutions alongside to ensure we can capture as much carbon as possible.”  Consider impacts on farmers, farming and land use Some assembly members said that “farmers need to change their methods” or more specifically that there should be “changes in wider farming practices in line with peatland/wetland management, eg ditches.” Others suggested that a “mechanism to compensate farmers needs to be in place.” Some assembly members said that “if crops are still grown, [I] would be in favour” or cautioned “don’t use all our cropland. Need to use the right land, e.g. moorlands where it’s not good for crops anyway. Don’t use fertile land.” Others asked for consideration of the “impacts…action today have on future opportunities such as farming and land use for the future.” More generally, some assembly members expressed “uncertainty over what will be lost.”  Manage it well Some assembly members said it “needs to be well managed” or that they supported it “as long as [it’s] managed properly.” Others said that it “needs to be managed and monitored to ensure it is effective and carbon isn’t being released” or that it “needs management to keep the areas wet.” Others said we “need to make sure these areas are being restored.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  444  Maintain but not restore Some assembly members said that existing peatlands and wetlands should be maintained, but that they wouldn’t support restoring them or creating new ones.  Bans, regulation and legislation Some assembly members suggested that “regulation is essential” or more specifically that we “should ban use of peat for compost” or that there’s a “need for governments to take a hardline against compost with peat as this creates a demand.” One assembly member said: “This should be done through very strong legislation to protect the areas from harm, including criminal sanctions for burning peatlands for grouse hunting.”  Individual assembly members said if it “means less use of chemicals, [I] would be in favour”, or expressed concerns about the destruction of peatlands to build windfarms. Others raised questions:  “ What do utility companies (which have to pay maintenance / management) think of it?” “ National parks, charities etc already do it. Not sure how much is already happening.” One assembly member suggested that “peatland and wetland re-wilding efforts should be done with the guidance of local environmental groups to ensure buy-in and support from the local community”. The same assembly member said we need to “put in place water supply back-up measures to prevent any drying or damage during our increasing heat-waves.” As seen in Section A, assembly members expressed strong support for restoring and managing peatlands and wetlands in their votes.  B.3 Enhancing the storage of carbon in the soil Enhancing the storage of carbon in the soil means changing the way soil is managed so that it can store more carbon. Assembly members discussed this option in small groups, noting pros and cons.  Pros Assembly members identified the following areas as points that they liked about enhancing the storage of carbon in the soil.  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  445  Environment impact and land use Some assembly members said that enhancing the storage of carbon in the soil “improves soil quality” or suggested there would be “benefits for farmers from soil fertility.” Others suggested there is a “general advantage to using soil wisely – it is common sense” or that it “must be a good idea – potential of carbon in the soil.” Others said “tilling carbon into the soil so it gets absorbed and enriches it … [means it’s] more fertile, similar to [using] compost.” Some assembly members said it would “contribut[e] to the health of the land and food grown through the use of less chemicals” or suggested more broadly that there would be “less pesticides”, and “less use of chemicals (fertilisers).” Some described it as a “natural process (chemical free)” or said it would involve “using natural fertilisers, rather than synthetic.” Other assembly members suggested there is “nothing to lose, I hate chemical fertilisers, we will get healthier foods, it’s a win/win” or said “we’re eating foods that come from the soil, so we need to make sure it’s of high quality and doesn’t contain anything that could jeopardise health.” One assembly member commented that a higher “quality of food [would be] produced….” Relatedly, for some assembly members enhancing the storage of carbon was “a natural approach” or “natural-ish.” Some suggested it “runs with nature rather than intensive farming”, “doesn’t disturb the land” or stated that “even if it doesn’t capture that much carbon still prefer natural – reaching net zero is not the only thing that’s important.” Others felt it “has added benefits (e.g. to the environment), that it’s “good for wildlife and birds” or that it “leads to good management of the land.” Following a different train of thought, some assembly members commented “like this one, requires changes to farming we would want to happen anyway. It’s a win-win.” Other similar views included: “Like that farmers have their way to make an impact – they have to pay a price. They know that they will have to be a big part of the action in the future.” “Could also support the transition to layered farming, diversifying the food produced from a single piece of land.” Some assembly members talked about a return to the “old ways”: “It would be positive to go back to the old ways, using crop rotation, which is beneficial to carbon capture.” “Out of the 6 methods [this is] probably the one I had least knowledge [of], asked the question and it’s like going back to the old ways of farming – instead of using modern fertilisers with chemicals, so [I] can see the advantage of that.” “I live next to an arable farm, I have lived there 30 years, it was a quiet farm, used to leave fields to rest, but now it is so intense, they are growing things so quickly….” Individual assembly members made a number of additional points, including that they liked that it “uses waste”, “enhances storage” or that it “doesn’t stop us using soil for crops, albeit different crops grown differently.” One said it woild be “fast to absorb carbon”, another that a “no-till option should be considered.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  446  Practicality, efficiency, readiness and scale Some assembly members described it as “well understood”, said “we have the knowledge and technology to do this” or that “changing farming methods is low cost and well understood.” Others noted that “some people are doing this already”, or suggested it would be “easy to implement”, “could be quite easily achieved with small changes”, “can be done quickly” or that we “can do this now.” One assembly member said they thought it would be “effective.” Another said it “might be more expensive than other practices… [it takes] much longer. [But it] [w]ill develop practices we can continue in the future. It’s long term.”  Costs, the economy and jobs Some assembly members said it “is cheap to do” or “low cost.” One assembly member suggested it “needs more labour so creates more jobs.”  Public support Some assembly members suggested it “may mean less production over time …but at the same time encourag[es] less food waste/changing diet so this may not be a bad thing anyway….” One assembly member said that it “works for vegetarians (there will be less livestock production).”  Safety and risk No assembly members made comments in this area.  Other Individual assembly members made a number of additional points. One said it is “great in theory if it works.” Another that it has “no downsides.” One said that “all the previous options have a benefit and should be done [including this one]” or that we “do need to use this as part of [the] solution but in a limited way.” One assembly member said they “saw an example of it being done on the telly – sounds interesting – documentary showed someone using direct ground sowing instead of ploughing. It was a researcher trying to get farmers to do it, but the farmer [him/her]self wasn’t that keen on it.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  447  Cons Assembly members identified the following areas as points that they disliked about enhancing the storage of carbon in the soil.  Environment impact and land use Some assembly members worried that it would mean importing more food, commenting “if we don’t grow it – it will have to be imported and that causes more carbon emissions” or “if we are not having our own facilities to produce livestock – where will it come from – it will have to be imported.” Some said that it “may lead to more food imports and the carbon footprint this would entail.”  Practicality, efficiency, readiness and scale Some assembly members said that “farmers will be reluctant” or that it “will be hard to make this happen, to shift away from modern methods, there are vested interests in farming.” Others said that “farmers need to support it” or that “without financial incentives it might not work.” Some commented that “farmers will be slow to change their methods as [they] are very traditional – it’s passed through the family so very hard to change tradition.” Others said that it’s “difficult to leave land untouched in this way.” Some assembly members felt it has “limited potential so don’t focus on this option”, that it “won’t be a solution in itself” or queried “how much [carbon] can soil absorb?”. Others suggested that “land saturates quickly, so not an on-going solution” or asked “after a certain amount of time the land gets saturated: how long can you store carbon? How long can you keep doing that?” Others made similar, but slightly more positive points: “Feels like a temporary solution: what do you do once the soil is saturated? Adding carbon into the soil might have benefits though (i.e. water retention is beneficial ….)” “…we should definitely do it, but it can only do so much, it may not be scalable to take in a lot of carbon compared to other solutions which take much more.” “It would be a good idea, but it can only contribute so much to the solution.” Others said it is “not done at scale right now” and “it would need to be used in conjunction with other technologies due to the limited capacity.” One assembly member commented that “it’s natural, but [I] like it less than managing forests as [it’s] less impactful and [I’m] less sure about how it works.” Some assembly members expressed a different concern, noting “uncertainty [about]… how long the carbon will stay underground”, or saying they were “unsure of how stable this type of storage is.” One assembly member suggested it “doesn’t work with other strategies for reducing carbon (which will also need land). Need to combine scenarios to see what feasibly works.” Another said we would be “less able to use this matter (i.e. compost material storing the carbon) for other purposes, e.g. as natural fertiliser.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  448  Costs, the economy and jobs Some assembly members suggested that “less produce makes food more expensive and [means] less jobs – goes against progress made in the past. People can’t afford to pay for food any more.” Others worried about a “knock-on effect on…[the] economy.” A number of assembly members said they disliked that we “will have to financially support a lot of farmers to do it – not sure how it can be low cost if [we] have to do this or where the money will come from given we will be losing EU subsidies too.” Others made similar points, suggesting it “could require financial support for farmers from [the] taxpayer – more expensive than peatlands or forestry etc ….” Others agreed that it will “need [a] subsidy for farming” or that it would result in a “lower profit margin for arable farmers, so needs subsidy.” Some asked whether the “costs of supporting farmers outweigh the benefits.” Relatedly, some assembly members suggested it “will take more work to farm” and is therefore “asking a lot of our farming community.” Others said there is a “need for work to be done with farmers as this is a radical change”, or that “there needs to be support for farmers” who “are struggling anyway….” Some assembly members highlighted the potential economic impact on farmers: “There could also be an economic impact on farmers if they aren’t producing as much food, the burden will be on them if they are making even less money.” “Will lead to lower crop yields and possibly lower food quality which will mean lower prices for farmers.” “Cost to farmers of changing their practices (because of need to disturb the soil much less), although they could develop new skills.”  Public support Some assembly members noted potential impacts on diets and lifestyles. Some said that the “issue with crop rotation is food becomes seasonal” or asked “how comfortable do we feel telling people what they can eat and restricting their diets? I’m comfortable with eating a seasonal diet, but are we comfortable telling others what they can / can’t eat.” Some noted a “potential concern that it may not be healthier”, noting that “in [the] past government had to add salt and sugar to prevent dietary problems associated with seasonal diets.” One assembly member suggested it “could create friction as its hard to get people to change behaviour.” Another said it “will it have a negative impact on the food supply chain with the demand to grow crops quickly. This could act as a limitation for buy-in to this method.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  449  Safety and risk A significant number of assembly members raised concerns about impacts on food production: − Food security – some assembly members saw it as a “threat to food security” or asked questions about its security implications: “…would we maintain [the] same level of self-sufficiency? “Will it affect food security in UK and can we afford to do it – will it make food more expensive?” “Yield – Concern about lower yield of food and the impact this would have on food security. Will we be reliant on other countries, what will happen if there is another pandemic? We need to be more self-sufficient than we are as a country” “Concerns about having left EU and whether dropping yields would mean less self-sufficiency.” − Crop yields and food production – some assembly members phrased their concerns in terms of yields, saying it “will impact on yields”, or “could reduce the amount of food from the land.” Others suggested that the “growing of crops will be reduced” and that we “need to think about that given the level of food poverty.” Others thought it “may lead to loss in food produce – and while more natural processes are good, we do need to keep eating food.” Some said they are “not too keen on this one as it was changing farming practices that reduce yield at a time when we are talking about using more land for other energy practices.” Some assembly members worried that it “can’t be good for carbon to be going into [the] ground or then our crops?” or expressed a “fear of carbon damaging the soil – least favourite of the options because of this.” Others said it “might cause problems further down the line.”  Other One assembly member disliked that it “would need regulation.”  Conditions Some assembly members noted conditions around enhancing the storage of carbon in the soil – points they felt would aid its implementation or that should be put in place. They suggested a need to:  Incentivise and subsidise farmers Some assembly members said that “financial incentives [are] required”, that “subsidy and support for farmers will be key” or that there “would need to be subsidies for farmers to adopt these practices as it lowers the productive yield of the land area.” Others agreed saying to “get that kind of change of agriculture, it’s going to take financial incentives” and they “would have to be good incentives.” Others suggested that there is a “likelihood of needing to offer farmers grants to use this approach…” or that we “need to provide grants.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  450  Combine it with other options and provide more information Some assembly members commented that it “would only really make a significant contribution if combined with good practice in forest, peat and wetlands management”, “if coupled with reforestation [it] might be a good option”, or that they’re “[h]oping there’s a hybrid solution that encapsulate the first 3 options and [is] not … overly reliant on one or another.” Others made similar points, whilst also noting a need for more information: “It can be done as well as – shouldn’t be instead of - may require a focus on getting information out to understand it better” “As [with] the previous 2 options it can be done as well as. May require some focus and provide more information to help people understand it better but should be considered regardless of the other choices”  Look at less essential areas first Some assembly members suggested that “air travel is a luxury – more pressure should be placed there” or commented that “farming is an essential industry – flying isn’t.”  Tackle food waste Some assembly members asked “how much food is wasted currently?” or said we “would need to reduce food waste e.g. stop throwing away ‘funny-shaped vegetables’ – role of supermarkets is key.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  451  Think about where to do it and how land is used Some assembly members said that it “must not be done on land used for farming” or that “if crops are still grown, [I] would be in favour.” Others suggested it “should be done where it can – every little helps” or noted “a lot of land [is] being used for golf courses in the UK. This isn’t essential. London has 11000 acres of golf course.”  Consider fertiliser use Some assembly members said “if it means less use of chemicals, [I] would be in favour” or noted that “we don’t want [our] dislike of this option [to be taken to] mean that we’re totally on board with polluting land with lots of fertilizer.”  Others assembly members commented that we “need farmers”, that there’s a need to “get farmers involved” or that “farmers will need firm guidance.” Others said that the “focus should be more on growing more of what we eat so we can become more self-sustaining.” As seen in Section A, assembly members expressed some support for enhancing the storage of carbon in the soil in their votes.  B.4 Using wood in construction Using wood in construction means storing carbon by using wood instead of other materials to build houses and other buildings. Trees naturally absorb and store carbon as they grow. This carbon stays trapped in the wood, again naturally, if they are cut down and used as timber in buildings. This process also creates space for new trees to grow and absorb more carbon from the atmosphere. An additional benefit to the climate is possible if timber is used instead of other materials such as concrete, which are currently manufactured with high carbon emissions. Assembly members discussed this option in small groups, noting pros and cons.  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  452  Pros Assembly members identified the following areas as points that they liked about using wood in construction.  Environment impact and land use Some assembly members felt that using wood in construction was a “good way to store carbon”, with some comparing it to other options saying we “prefer [it] to CCS as [it] captures all the CO2” or that it “locks the carbon in the building compared to BECCS which still releases some carbon back into the atmosphere…” Others suggested it provides “good long-term storage of carbon, while being put to a practical use.” Some commented that it is a “good building material – plus [it’s] natural and carbon storing” or, similarly, that it’s “a great construction material taking carbon out of the atmosphere – makes a lot of sense to be using wood as a building material.” Others said simply it’s a “good way to reduce CO2.” For some assembly members a positive was that it “avoids more CO2 intensive products (e.g. steel/concrete)”, “reduces the need for cement and concrete” or would “change building practices away from using PVC etc which have negative carbon impacts in production.” Others said there would be “knock on benefits…[from] reducing the demand for concrete, iron and other materials”, or that it’s “not the golden solution but [we] should utilise it so that it replaces more carbon intensive material such as concrete.” Some labelled it a “low carbon building option, if they’re [the trees are] from the UK.” Others liked the reduced need to use bricks. A number of assembly members said using wood in construction is “sustainable and practical”, a “sustainable approach – Australia [has] lots of wooden buildings outside of cities” or that “compared to BECCS this is definitely a more sustainable method – using the wood for construction rather than for fuel alone.” Others felt that “when [you] look at [the] long life cycle, it’s good” or that “when compared to [other] building materials the life cycle of wood has a lower overall impact on the environment.” Some said it’s “not the same as the deforestation in [the] Amazon – it’s just cutting fast growth timber from sustainable forests.” Others suggested that “even if wood has to be imported it would logically be shipped which is a low carbon form of transportation.” Some assembly members suggested that “wood can be recycled – I use pallets in my garden” or that “wood used in buildings can be used and reused even if the building is demolished.” Some assembly members said that they “like the idea because it’s green and because it doesn’t produce carbon dioxide” or that “using renewable materials is positive.” Some suggested it’s “natural”, a “natural option”, a “natural proces[s]” or that it’s “always been done and [is a] natural low cost way to store carbon.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  453  Practicality, efficiency, readiness and scale For some assembly members, using wood in construction works well with other greenhouse gas removal methods. Some said it “will mean there’s a use for the increased timber that we’re growing”, that it will “use the wood from the forests we plant” or that it “combines the goal of forest growth and using the wood so that forests are regenerated.” Similar comments included: “Works well with [the] idea of planting forests as [they] need to be planted on [a] long term basis to get large trees for construction – works well with forest management – need trees in different stages – can also help with BECCS.“ “Fits the jigsaw: grow trees and then do something with them, so the carbon is locked up.” “Trees absorb the greatest amount of carbon in the early period of their life so when they’re felled that’s their productivity done. To use the material then makes sense. The natural technology locks the carbon for [the] lifetime of the build which can be for 20–40 years plus.” Some assembly members were sceptical about the potential negatives of the method. Some noted that it “can be laminated/ fire- treated to be used in higher builds” or that “new tech, e.g. coatings, is improving quality.” One assembly member commented said that “personally [I] think it’s a great idea – asked Chris [Stark] on Saturday about what happened to buildings knocked down or destroyed where the carbon is released into [the] atmosphere but buildings in UK last longer up to a few hundred years so less of an issue when we are trying to reach net zero in 30 years.” Others suggested there is “not necessarily any difference in strength and appearance versus current [buildings]” or that wood “can be durable.” Some commented that they “feel positively about it because…[there are] very old houses e.g. in Stratford that have lasted for hundreds of years with wooden beams etc” or that we “have wood frame houses that are still here many years later…but do we have the skills to still do this?” Some assembly members said that “wood can be used in lots of different ways” or that “wood is a very flexible material – can be used in lots of different ways in construction.” Others suggested that “you can build more quickly using wood – but this comes at the cost of being 10% more expensive” or that it’s “quicker to build with wood construction.” Some suggested it would be “warmer – wood houses are easier to keep warm than concrete” or that wooden houses would provide “better insulation.” Some assembly members said using wood in construction is “tried and tested, practical, saves CO2”, that it is “well used”, “being used already (USA, South Africa, Nordic countries)” or “we know how to do this already.” One assembly members said it is “simple.” Individual assembly members noted a variety of other points. One said they were “excited by new engineering using wood”, another that it “creates a useful product which satisfies a national need”, another that it “grows quickly and [is] good for [the] purpose.” One liked that it is a “longterm project as [you are] growing trees over a long time and then using wood.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  454  Costs, the economy and jobs Some assembly members suggested it “could be cheaper (as a material in construction/house price)”, or is “cheaper” or “low cost.” Others foresaw a “lower cost of house building, with prebuilding off site” or suggested that “wooden houses / buildings could be cheaper – advantage for first-time buyers.” One assembly member described it as “more commercially viable.”  Public support Some assembly members commented that wood is “aesthetically pleasing”, “pretty”, “a good and pleasant material”, or a “lovely material”. Others said they “love this idea – timber houses are beautiful aesthetically”, “[we] like a nice wooden house”, or we “love the architecture and wooden beams, but [are] concerned about safety and cost.“ Some suggested it “looks nice – can be used for local businesses, smaller builds so not just homes.” A number of assembly members were pleased that it “can’t build tall buildings as people don’t want to live in the air”: “Like the idea that we won’t have as many tall buildings in our cities – like buildings that are in keeping with [the] landscape. After covid the increase in home working [means] we won’t need as many high rise office blocks. Some of these are redundant anyway – parts of the [hotel the assembly took place in] in Birmingham were not let; wasn’t really needed in the first place.” Some assembly members said “we are familiar with wood building”, or that it’s “well known.” One assembly member suggested that “carpenters will like it.” Another liked the “opportunity to build more with wood.” A third felt positive about the “incremental change in the way we live.”  Safety and risk No assembly members made points in this area.  Other Some assembly members said that “in principle [it’s a] good idea to use wood” or that it “sounded positive – can’t see any negatives.” Others said it’s a “no-brainer as long as [it’s] used in conjunction with other methods”, that we “should use it where we can”, that they are “positive about it” or that there are “no downsides.” One assembly member said: “Wood has been used for centuries when constructing buildings. It is probably the most common building material used in bigger countries such as America, Australia etc. We would also need to grow more forests/woodlands to supply the wood material over the longer term. A win/win situation.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  455  Cons Assembly members identified the following areas as points that they disliked about using wood in construction.  Environment impact and land use Some assembly members raised concerns about imports and sustainability. Some worried that “UK wood supply might not be sufficient”, said they had “concerns about there not being a sustainable source of wood to allow the scale needed,” or disliked that “in the short term, we’ll need to import timber to do this.” One assembly said: “There’s a lot of construction going on in Cornwall [where I live]– need a lot more forest to match it. Scale not feasible, and amount of time needed to grow all the trees needed.” Some assembly members asked “how do we know wood is coming from sustainable forests and not from other countries not done sustainably?” or said they disliked “importing from other countries (e.g. Baltic) if the wood is not from sustainable sources.” Others felt that “shipping trees from elsewhere to use in UK construction would be a problem because of the fuel used.” Some assembly members suggested that “lots of regulation [would be] needed to make this local and sustainable.” Raising a different point, some assembly members asked “if this means low-density housing, do we have the space for that?” or said “lower density is more land – meaning that we have to build out instead of up.” Some assembly members expressed “concern about land use, other things may be more important e.g. forests and farming.”  Practicality, efficiency, readiness and scale A large number of assembly members raised concerns around “implications for building durability and strength”: − Maintenance – some assembly members said they had “concerns about the ongoing maintenance of buildings like this” or that they “will need…repairs.” Others talked about “wet rot, dry rot, pests” or said that wood buildings are “not so good for wear and tear: could be a problem with water and pest damage. Wood expands and contracts, can cause problems.” Some of these assembly members suggested that these were “hurdles we can get over probably.” − Quality and longevity – some assembly members queried “longer term durabiltity” or the “quality and longevity of the building.” Some commented that “industrial wood is different to nature’s wood – if they build cheap nasty houses, it will be a short-term solution” or that “timber framed buildings in 1970s turned out to be a disaster – had to be torn down because [they] weren’t built straight, wood got wet etc.” Others suggested wood is “not as permanent as steel or concrete.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  456  − Life span – some assembly members suggested that “timber frame houses have a short lifespan” or that we “need to balance [the] sacrifice of not using normal building materials with what the benefit is – don’t want to sacrifice something if have to tear them down and rebuild them in forty years.” Other assembly members said that “brick homes feel more secure” or referenced the “‘three little pigs’ i.e. doesn’t seem sensible to build homes out of materials that don’t seem as strong as brick/stone.” Some said they were “unsure about their efficiency (heat/energy etc)” or queried “whether wooden houses were appropriate for the UK’s climate.” Some assembly members disliked the “difficulty of building tall buildings with it”, that it “can’t yet be used for taller buildings” or that it “only works for low rise buildings.” Some assembly members suggested that not being able to build tall buildings “may be an issue with population growth”, commented that we “can’t all live in semidetached houses” or said that using wood would be “impractical for the big housing estates we need in the UK.” Others asked “what’s required for us to make the transition away from building very tall buildings in commercial use?” Some assembly members suggested using wood in construction is “limited by the amount of wood available” or said they were “not sure what scale this can be done [at].” Others said it “can’t be done at [the] scale needed” or that there are “some questions about [the] scale of this – needs to be done with other approaches – like it less than forests and peatlands.” Some assembly members raised concerns about capacity, suggesting there is “limited capacity in UK – i.e. only need 330,000 new houses to meet demand, so where will we use the wood?” or said that there would be “lots of problems getting enough manufacturing capacity in the UK.” Some assembly members said it “takes a long time to grow” or asked “where is the wood going to come from? If it’s hard wood, that takes a long time to grow.” A number of assembly members were sceptical about the impact of wood in construction on emissions. Comments included: “If they don’t last long, you’ll be releasing carbon” “Other technologies might have more impact – need to find a better concrete that is longer lasting and doesn’t use so much carbon” “Materials used to make things out of wood aren’t so low carbon either e.g. plastics injected” “Can’t absorb carbon once built (only store)” “Potentially robbing Peter to pay Paul – would demand for timber decimate the forests?” “Hard to see [a] major impact on carbon, won’t fix it all” One assembly member asked “is there any political will – there was a Code for Sustainable Homes that was scrapped.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  457  Costs, the economy and jobs Some assembly members raised “concern about cost”, suggesting it “might raise construction costs” or that the “current prices of wood as a building material seem to be too high for people to do this voluntarily.” Some suggested a need to “consider people who aren’t on the property ladder; will they be able to afford a property – they shouldn’t be burdened.” A number of assembly members suggested that “we’d need a new skill set and change to modern building practices” or that there would have to a “change to business skills e.g. brick layers.” Some asked, “would construction companies want to do it, given steel frame is quicker and easier to put up than a wood frame, and easier to shape? Do they have the skills, if they haven’t been using wood for ages?” One assembly member suggested a need to find an “economic balance with the take away from steel production.”  Public support One assembly member felt that the “public will be sceptical.” Another raised a “concern this is being proposed by policy-makers to sidestep more difficult questions about housing stock – they should be focussing on making sure everyone has a home in the first place rather than using carbon reduction as a diversion e.g. addressing [the] high proportion of second homes in certain areas.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  458  Safety and risk Some assembly members worried about “fire safety and safety issues”, asking “will houses burn?” or saying they were “worried about fire in cities.” Some said they had a “question as to whether the laminate made it safer” or asked “do the chemicals used as fire retardants have negative impacts on human health/emissions?” Others said there is a “greater risk of fire in properties built with wood”, while some talked about the Grenfell tragedy: “Remember Grenfell tower. Reason why we use steel now is because of concerns over fire. It [wood] will also be weaker when it is wet.” “The buildings burning down – concerned about lack of regulatory control (e.g. Grenfell) to manage this.” Some assembly members expressed concerns about “risks of flooding and severe weather – how strong are they?”  Conditions Some assembly members noted conditions around using wood in construction – points they felt would aid its implementation or that should be put in place. They suggested a need to:  Manage it properly Some assembly members said they would support it “as long as it is managed effectively” or that “if it is done properly then it’s a good idea.” Some commented that “while off the top of your head you are thinking don’t chop trees… when properly managed it makes a lot of sense.” One assembly member noted: *There are 800 year old buildings made of timber and very new concrete buildings falling down. It’s how we manage them that is the important thing.”  Reduce fire risk Some assembly members said that “growing the trees will take time, which will buy time for finding ways of reducing fire risk.” Others said they would support the idea if “the fire risk can be reduced” or if “there are ways to make it less flammable.” Some commented that it “must be fire safe.” Other assembly members suggested we need “legislation to ensure that building with wood is done correctly (addressing the safety concerns)” or that we “need robust regulation.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  459  Do it sustainably Some assembly members said they were “happy as long as it is managed and done sustainably”, while others suggested a need to “regulate to ensure sustainability and keeping it local.” Some assembly members said it “needs to be done properly, using a tree at the end of its’ life” or that the “danger is trees are just used for building houses and felled before their most efficient period of capturing carbon.” Others said they “need to be built to last, with the right wood, otherwise carbon will be released.” Some said there is a need to look at “what happens to the wood afterwards” and that it “still doesn’t solve the problem of what to do with the timber at the very end of its life.” Others suggested that “unless you set up a good recycling system with CCS” the end of life question was “a risk.”  Consider which building to use it for Some assembly members said that “demand for new houses should be met by using timber” or “definitely for new build houses but not for hospitals and key buldings.” Conversely others queried, “our building stock is old…how much new construction will there be?” Some assembly members said they would “like to use it where we can but not to the detriment of the safety/ longevity of a building.” Some asked “can terraced housing be made of wood? This needs a mindset change to buy and maintain buildings like this.”  Think about other uses too Some assembly members noted that we can use wood for “furniture, doors, houses”, or said “we need to cast our imagination wider, use it for bridges, infrastructure etc.”  Use UK trees and fit plans to supply Some assembly members said they would support it “if we can use UK trees”, that it’s “less advantageous if we have to import wood” or that it “needs greater supply of UK wood (would defeat purpose if wood was imported).” Relatedly, others suggested that “scale needs to be limited to supply.” Some assembly members pointed out that some “cement is made abroad.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  460  Develop skills, technology and infrastructure Some assembly members suggested that “we need to learn the skills to build and maintain the buildings” or that “we need time to develop the skills to do it at scale.” Others said that it “needs further development e.g. lamination method for strengthening wood” or that we “need factories to process the timber and build the sections for the buildings.” Some asked “Government to incentivise [the] building industry to change and re-skill.”  Think globally Some assembly members felt it “requires [a] global response” and is “more suitable for some countries than others.” Relatedly, some assembly members talked about their own experiences abroad: “Lucky enough to spend a year in California and 2 years in Japan, earthquake areas, don’t build with bricks. Normal domestic buildings are made of wood. … don’t have the longevity – 30 years maximum – striking. Don’t expect the longevity of brick building. Talking to people – living in rural Japan: when a couple gets married, they build their own house, there is no second hand house market – very different approach. Heard it said: you plan a brick building to last 100 years in the UK. More in tune with current living – decades vs hundreds years. If you build houses every thirty years, it is more in tune with the way we live currently.” “Relatives who live in the US. Even in New York – lots of wood in building – cheaper to build, and it does decay – have to change panels….”  Other points made by individual assembly members included: be done in factories to be more efficiently built – built to the way you want it – “ …should … build faster/ ensure less waste – go for wood – the way we build now is not efficient.” need to be mandated to create the economies of scale that would make it “ …would an affordable option for builders, particularly in larger commercial buildings.”  “ Happier for longer-growing trees.” “ Need good quality timber and timber products.” “ Treat the wood, but take care what chemicals used.” In the votes, assembly members expressed strong support for using wood in construction.

Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  461  B.5 Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) means using wood or crops for energy, capturing and storing the carbon dioxide released when they are burned. Assembly members discussed this option in small groups, noting pros and cons.  Pros Assembly members identified the following areas as points that they liked about BECCS.  Environment impact and land use Some assembly members said that there’s a “place for it because of the energy it creates and can be used for” or that it’s a “carbon-neutral way of getting energy.” Others liked the energy production but at a small scale: “Energy production and captures positive elements – but for use at a small scale” “For heating – small plants could be useful, could have its own role. Still, not to that large extent where you have a massive power plant.” One assembly member said it “encompasses lots of good elements, but not at a large scale.” Some assembly members said they were “not massively positive about this option but do like idea of growing crops and plant material to burn for fuel….” Others said “I quite like it – use the trees we’re growing” or “the idea is good – use what we grow.” Some suggested it’s “sustainable, once [you’ve] used the crops you can regrow.” One assembly member said it’s a “natural fuel [and a] win-win. The carbon has been absorbed recently.” Others argued: “The wood that is imported is fast grown in places where it makes sense to…[grow] them, shipping the wood is low cost in terms of emissions. When turned into pellets and burned using this technology for energy and subsequently capturing the carbon for storage it is a virtuous circle that has got benefits to it.” Some assembly members said they liked it “if it is making use of waste products to generate energy” or that the “only advantage to this would be if you were burning waste.” A number of assembly members said “CCS will be a game changer”, “with the CCS attached – there is a huge impact”, or it “should have a large effect.” Others suggested that it’s the “greatest chance of getting us to net zero in the timeframe” or that it “does a lot in a short space of time.” Some talked about the “sheer volume of carbon dioxide we can achieve through this approach”, with some commenting it’s “more…than the natural options.” One assembly member said “BECCS is my first choice because of the sheer volume of removal of CO2.” Others similar comments included: “Think it will be effective. Will be higher in cost than natural approaches but we are going to need to spend some money to make a big difference.” “Come round to BECCS compared to before – if it’s done properly it can be hugely positive, given how much CO2 this method can take out of the atmosphere. Needs to be regulated to ensure its done in the right way – i.e. not growing forests just for the sake of burning wood.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  462  Practicality, efficiency, readiness and scale Some assembly members said BECCS “has a part to play along with other solutions” or that it “should be part of a broad range of solutions – we have to try everything.” Others said that it “can take up [the] remainder after other methods [are] exhausted - has potential” or that it “would be OK in moderation, but prefer natural processes.” Some assembly members said “we do need to keep the lights on when the wind stops blowing – analysis seems to show we’re still going to have to use gas – so CCS is needed (although not necessarily BECCS).” Some commented that “technology is an important part of the solution.” Some assembly members suggested that “in the future, there will be a lot more bio-energy. [….] … there is potential – option worth considering – in 100 years, might be the main method we are using for energy. That might be the future.” Others made similar points: “My favourite option – I understand that it takes time. Even if it captures 60% now with the tech we have in the future it will become more efficient.” “This is probably the way forward. Use the trees to heat our homes.” A number of assembly members noted that a range of resources needed for BECCS already exist. Some said “we have the plants needed for the biomass” or that “existing power stations can be converted.” Others said that “we have enough storage space” or that the “storage is there”. Some mentioned it “seems good in theory that we can use the empty space left by oil and gas extraction to store carbon” or talked about the “potential of so many empty gas and oil fields in [the] north sea that it could be stored in… expensive to get them there, but would revert to a solid over time.” One assembly member commented: “I was very opposed to CCS initially, I was imagining CO2 ready to leak out, but Chris Stark talked about it bound in the rocks: no possibility of leakages. Doesn’t create risks for future generations. [My] [o]pinion about CCS shifted a lot…if carbon is bound in a solid inert form under the sea, with no risks of escaping, much more keen….” Some assembly members suggested BECCS is an “end-of-life solution for timber which has been used in construction” or that “if we have to renew the forests – then it seems to make sense. It’s better as a by-product instead of for its own sake.” Similarly other assembly members commented: “If done well, it’s a plausible idea. For example, the forests need to be well managed and the biomass should be created as a by-product of other processes.” Some assembly members said we have “good knowledge of how it works” or “some proof/maths that it can reduce the problem.” One assembly member said it’s “achievable.” Another said “my own experience of heat networks is positive.”  Costs, the economy and jobs Some assembly members talked about an “economic revitalisation potential (e.g. Teeside)” or said they “like [the] idea of converting old coal fired power stations to biomass, you can employ the same people.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  463  Public support Some assembly members said it “will make use of industrial expertise, technological knowledge, it will create lots of interest – it’s a 21st century solution which will be appealing.”  Safety and risk One assembly member felt “reassured regulation will make it safe.”  Other Some assembly members said they preferred BECCS to other options. Some commented it is “better than the soil option if you can contain the CO2” or that it “seems a better idea than the fossil fuel power plant CCS.” Others suggested that it “offers things that other processes don’t. It can be used for essential fuels instead of fossil fuels e.g. aviation.” Some suggested that it “may be more effective than other options.” One assembly member said “I like the concept.”  Cons Assembly members identified the following areas as points that they disliked about BECCS.  Environment impact and land use A large number of assembly members suggested BECCS failed to address the problem. Some said they are “worried that it takes the focus off the amount that we are emitting in the first place” by sending “the message that there is a magic technology taking carbon out of there”: “Just using technology to hide our own mess for the future. It’s not a solution. We need to change our way of living and not just rely on tech to clean up our mess.” “They are only capturing the CO2 they have produced in the first place, why not not produce it in the first place.” “Not convinced that this will actually reduce carbon, will just be taking out what it puts in.” Similarly, some assembly members said we “can’t always rely on a quick tech fix” or suggested that “this is being pushed politically – a tech solution is politically more convenient than the behaviour change options that are needed.” Some said they “don’t see it as a very long term solution” or commented: “If net zero is meant to be about securing the long-term / our children and grandchildren’s futures then this seems like simply pushing the problem under the carpet for others to solve later.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  464  Relatedly, some assembly members noted “concern people will get carried away with technologies like this, we mustn’t rely solely on new technologies and simply carry on as normal. What happens if it doesn’t work?” Others said it “seems like doubling down…If it works, great, but if it doesn’t we’re screwed.” Some assembly members asked “what if we waste 10 years and don’t get the carbon reduction we need?” or “if we still have this problem in 100 years what happens then?” Some assembly members raised further points about its impact on emissions, noting that it “only takes in a certain amount – not net zero in itself” or commenting “as a concept it seems very difficult to imagine how it achieves net zero, might it cause increases in CO2?” One assembly member noted that you “need energy to do this.” Some assembly members disliked the “amount of land it will need”, felt it “needs lots of land (if at scale)” or noted “concern about biomass and too much land take if people get carried away.” Others suggested it “takes up a lot of space that could be used for a lot of other things e.g. crops or forestry or houses”, “uses up land that could be used for other purposes” or said they were worried about the “impact on food production and biodiversity.” One assembly member commented: “At the risk of being wrong: we’ve not been self-sufficient in food since before WW1, I’d prefer food security as a priority.” Some assembly members disliked “imports from other countries” or queried “can we grow enough? Will we have to import fuel?” Others commented “really against this – the ethics of where [we’re] buying this from…”, or “didn’t realise we may need to import trees to use for bioenergy for this – this defeats the purpose of trying to get to net zero.” Some asked, “would some of the trees need to come from abroad – so there would be shipping costs and emissions from shipping – seems ludicrous” or noted “at Drax, wood is converted to chips and dried. Theirs is from Sweden and the US. It goes through several stages before it is burnt.” Some assembly members said: “…biomass burning is currently using trees from the United States where there is less regulation compared to other countries. They have been known to fell old growth forests to chop down into wood pellets to burn – so actually by burning such wood this carbon is released back into the atmosphere that would otherwise have been stored in the trees….” Some assembly members commented “don’t grow trees to cut them down and burn them”, it’s a “bad thing if we are just planting things to burn”, or “growing stuff to burn it...conflicted by the burning element, hard to tolerate. What are the real implications at scale – is it feasible.” Others said that they “don’t have a problem with capturing carbon, but [it’s a] bad idea to be burning wood, might as well burn coal and capture that.” Some suggested it “seems to be a long way round – to grow trees, burn them and then capture their emissions.” Some assembly members worried about the “impact on wildlife” or said they were “worried about nature e.g. birds nesting” when forests are thinned. Others suggested there is a “risk of changing the make up / health of the oceans” because of where the carbon is stored. One assembly member said I “generally, prefer more natural solutions e.g. forest management.” Another commented that they “can see problems with deforestation – timber has to come from somewhere – can’t believe it’s a viable proposal.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  465  Practicality, efficiency, readiness and scale Some assembly members said they are “sceptical of the whole thing given it hasn’t been tested fully to any scale” or suggested there is “no proof of doing it at scale.” Others had related concerns, querying its “feasibility at scale – high cost, infrastructure?”, or asking “will it be very local, e.g. heat networks? Is it plausible across the country?” Some questioned “is there enough biomass?” Relatedly, some assembly members said that the “technology is new”, “not proven”, “not well understood” or that they are “not convinced it is viable.” Others commented specifically that “carbon capture is new, not well tested – will it work?” or suggested “we don’t know if it actually turns back into rock,” or that there is “no evidence of how the natural rocks in proposed storage sites will really react to the ‘carbon sponges’ over time.” Some suggested that the “technology doesn’t even exist yet – it’s ‘pie in the sky’.” Others queried “will it be done on time?” or commented “at the moment we have no way of carbon capturing – plant was supposed to be built 5 years ago….” Some assembly members felt BECCS is less preferable than other energy sources. Some said that we “may as well use coal” or that “if you’ve got the carbon capture technology, why not use it for gas and coal – industrial revolution showed we moved away from timber burning for a reason, it’s inefficient – leave it in the timber in the first place.” Others suggested it “only takes carbon out of the atmosphere to the extent that it reduces other forms of power generation. So, does it make sense to do this at all – should we not, for example, use wind power instead?”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  466  Some assembly members suggested that “having enough storage is a challenge” or that it “sounds good on paper but how much space under the ground will it need?” Individual assembly members commented that it “would need a lot of infrastructure”, or that “I don’t like the idea of storing CO2: much better to create synthetic fuels….” One said “pellets are an issue – it’s complicated.” Another assembly said that “burning wood for generating electricity is a very inefficient method. For the same of amount of electricity generated, it creates 4 times as much CO2 as natural gas and approximately 1.25 times more than coal. Also, it has a very low energy density, and you need a lot of it. So it’s not a very efficient or effective method of generating electricity, or reducing CO2.”  Costs, the economy and jobs Some assembly members talked about “high costs”, “very high cost” or “expensive capital.” Others said it “seems like a higher cost than other solutions”, that it’s “too costly therefore not feasible” or that the “initial high cost would put people off.” Some said it’s “expensive (particularly when the investment is in an unknown outcome).” Some assembly members asked “would people be willing to pay?”, “will government pay?” or “who’s going to pay for the buildings needed? Tax payers or private companies?” Some assembly members suggested “there would be a lot of costs involved in re-skilling and re-training people to grow trees.” Others noted “cost….[is] expensive, although will there be a bigger reward in the longer term?”  Public support Some assembly members said they disliked “transport options [for] getting the fuel to the plant” or that “Drax has huge trains bringing fuel to the plant.” One assembly member said: “[I] live next to a biogas plant: doesn’t have CCS. It is a nightmare because the farmer is supposed to grow maize to supply the plant – hundreds of trucks coming in and out of his farm for about a month: creates a lot of emissions. [….] Huge amount of maize is imported: keeps the plant going for the whole year. Should not have had the go ahead. He is not operating the plant as he should do.”  Safety and risk A very large number of assembly members said they were worried about leaks. Points included: − It’s a risk – some assembly members commented that “there are many examples of things we previously believed were safe and now know they weren’t – it’s [carbon storage] a risk we don’t have to take”. Others said they “wouldn’t feel confident that the carbon wouldn’t escape”, or that it amounted to “taking [the] problem out of the air and putting it in the ground, not solving anything, it might leak out there.” Some suggested that the “carbon store part is a concern. Time only will tell if it’s a viable option, not enough information to know at this point.” Others suggested that “CO2 under pressure is used to drive out oil, but when stored will high pressure CO2 create earthquakes and the release of CO2? It’s not viable long term, risks [are] too high”;  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  467  − Distrust of man-made answers – some assembly members suggested that “nature approaches can’t go that far wrong, but this can really go wrong – high risk – don’t feel there is proof that this will work e.g. leakage, problems with transport.” Others said “we don’t know enough about [the] dangers of man-made solutions – it’s all new and [the] risk is too high” or that “all the man-made solutions have the potential to destroy, … need to keep them to a minimum…”; − Potential for disaster – some assembly members talked about a “risk of accidents and CO2 being released back into the atmosphere” or said they are “very concerned that it’s speculative and what will happen if it fails, if the CO2 escapes? An uncontrollable disaster? CO2 is a big risk as a stored gas, uncontrolled release.” Others talked about a “risk that in 10, 20, 50 years time there could be a massive carbon release as sites fail and this could lead to environmental melt-down.” Some asked, “what happens if there is an earthquake?” Others said “it’ll work but burning and storing CO2 is dangerous, therefore build demand for other options e.g. using wood for construction, synthetic fuels.” Some assembly members said they “would rather have a small amount of nuclear waste in the north sea than a load of carbon dioxide” or that it “feels like burying rubbish underground.” Others had concerns about “transport to storage in oil fields”, with some suggesting it was a “terrifying concept – 50m tonnes of CO2 being transported. That’s a lot.”  Other Some assembly members said there is “too much push from industry on this – are they influencing the climate change committee?” or that “CCS feels like a bit of a PR stunt, pushed by big companies. But a tree can already do this.” One assembly member said I “don’t see BECCS as a solution – burning something so quick that could be used for construction – can’t capture all of the carbon – feel like it’s wishful thinking that this could be the solution – should be considering the other options – massive amount needed to grow to meet need for something that is going to be used up very quickly, which leads to massive deforestation.”  Conditions Some assembly members noted conditions around BECCS – points they felt would aid its implementation or that should be put in place. They suggested a need to:  Think about scale Some assembly members said we should “use [it] as a small scale solution” or that it “would be OK as long as it’s done in moderation.” Others said “75% BECCs is too much, use other options.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  468  Only use it where there is no alternative Some assembly members asked “could it be capped…to air travel and agriculture: could it be restricted to meet the needs of what can’t be reduced?” Others said it’s “fine when used for essential fuels e.g. bio fuels for airplanes, where only alternative is fossil fuels.”  Use natural approaches first Some assembly members said we “need to prioritise natural options”, “need to use up options 1–3 first before resorting to this” or “should be using natural approaches straight away as we know they will work and use these technologies in the background as over time we will understand them better, they will improve, cost may improve.” Some commented that we “need to have some more reliable forms of energy for when not windy etc, so carbon capture is helpful for those times – didn’t like idea of burning wood for this – if this is necessary then fine but sceptical on cutting trees down to burn them when we might as well keep using gas and capture carbon from that.” Others suggested that “historically, carbon has been stored in the soil and converted into oils and diamonds, and coal etc… We need to push that carbon option. “  Undertake research and development Some assembly members said it “needs further development” or “needs to be encouraged. […] Let’s put money and investment and explore.” Others commented “if these CCS techniques improve, if storing in geological space if safe, then it’s possible.” One assembly said it “needs more funding to improve the system and ensure Carbon Capture is secure.”  Consider which raw materials to use and where they come from Some assembly members said they would be happy “only if we use waste products, not if we import” or that we “must focus on doing this with waste – don’t use ‘useable’ materials for this.” Some said “with wood – must use waste, eg from the ‘wood in construction’ option.” Others said “don’t import materials for this method” or suggested that “using this method would require close regulation to ensure practices such as those in the US are not repeated here.” One assembly member commented: “Bioenergy with carbon storage seems to be a fantastic carbon neutral source of energy. However, the biomass needs to be from the UK and not imported.”  Consider and manage risks Some assembly members said we “need to weigh up the risks and rewards”, that “storage facilities need to be well managed” or that “I would be in favour if it was proven it would be 100% secure.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  469  Queries around funding Some assembly members said they would be in favour “if the cost can be reduced.” Others raised queries: “There was funding by the UK to create a CCS facility – it was abandoned as economically unviable. Why did this happen?” “Why hasn’t the government supported this – is it because of the cost or because the science isn’t there?”  Must not be used for enhanced oil recovery Some assembly members discussed that any carbon captured “must not be used for the process of enhanced oil recovery” saying it would make BECCS “entirely self-defeating and will lead to even greater emissions.”  Individual assembly members commented that it “needs to be part of a range of GHG [removal] measures”, that it “must be done sustainably, eg no fertilisers to rush growth”, or that “technology is great, but humans need to start taking responsibility for our impact on our surroundings.” Others individuals said they would support it if “we use reverse pipelines to transport the carbon to the storage area” or “if we can meet the capacity for this and Wood for Construction.” One assembly talked about their own experience of living next to a biogas plant, already noted above: Need controls: otherwise causing so much trouble. Planning application required “ that he grew the maize himself. He is not operating the plant as he should. Reported. Inspectors. But there’s a line of communication between him and council officials from the local authorities.” As seen in Section A, assembly members expressed limited support for BECCS in their votes.  B.6 Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS) Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS) means using technologies to capture carbon dioxide directly from the air, then storing the carbon. Assembly members discussed this option in small groups, noting pros and cons.  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  470  Pros Assembly members identified the following areas as points that they liked about DACCS.  Environment impact and land use Some assembly members liked that DACCS “can be located at sea so not using land”, that we “don’t need to grow anything – land can be used for other things” or that it’s “not taking up land as much.” Some noted that it “can capture a lot of CO2” or “could take more carbon out than just net zero.” One assembly member commented: “I believe the direct carbon capture and storage will actively address the challenge we face of removing carbon by 2050.” Others said it’s a “really good idea – has the potential for large capacity.” Some assembly members suggested DACCS is “very clean”, “cleaner” or that it meant our “energy requirement can be met by clean energy.” One assembly member commented: “I feel this is the cleanest method of removal with the smallest carbon footprint associated with it, that has the most capability for significant removal of CO2.”  Practicality, efficiency, readiness and scale Some assembly members said it “can be located anywhere” or that it doesn’t “need to attach next to a power plant, can put [it] wherever.” Others suggested it “could be carried out close to the storage spaces (e.g. offshore, or close to offshore connections) so reducing transportation compared to other CCS options” or that it “can be located to reduce [the] cost of transport.” Some suggested it “can be placed beside off shore windmills which seems like the perfect solution”, that it “could be wind powered” or that it “could be done at sea e.g. powered by wind farms.” Some assembly members labelled it “part of the mix of options to remove GHG” or felt it “has potential as part of the mix of solutions.” Others said it “doesn’t hurt to have it – not a huge part to play but every little helps? One of many parts of the strategy”, that it’s “possibly a quick solution if all other measures fail” or that the “only real positive could be that it’s an in-between solution.” Some assembly members felt it’s a “good idea, but shouldn’t be done on its own. It is a new tech and so we don’t know how effective it will be or how cost effective – should be a back up option but not the main part of the approach to net zero.” Others said it’s “good to develop new technologies” or that “science can help us and innovation can be used to remove the excess CO2.” A number of assembly members noted that we “have the North Sea for storage” or that the “storage capacity exists (under the north sea).” Some liked the “simplicity of the method” or noted that “one of the speakers described it as a floating boat stuck next to a power plant in the north sea…if it’s as simple as that, it sounds OK.” Some assembly members suggested there was an “opportunity for international collaboration”:  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  471  “This needs to happen, but could be more effective elsewhere in the world, e.g. set it up near the equator to use solar energy, run in partnership with the UK investing.” “Saudi Arabia would be a good place to develop this, with the sun for renewable power and all the ex-oil storage. We should be thinking about worldwide approaches here.” Individual assembly members made a range of other points. One said I “quite like the idea…. How big would the plants be? Would we have fields of direct air capture like wind turbines or would we put them out to sea?” Another said “the mechanical units can be small, don’t have to be big.” Others noted that “lots of research has been done” or that it “only takes 2 years to convert it to rock. I thought it would have been much greater than this.” One suggested that we “could use the carbon captured for useful things like carbon fibres (same for other CC technologies).” Another said I “prefer it to BECCS.” One said there are “no physical inputs [of biomass] required.”  Costs, the economy and jobs Some assembly members suggested that we “will start to get a return which will drive down costs”, that “costs could fall” or that the “cost could come down over time.” Others suggested it “may give the biggest bang for buck”, or that “oil and gas companies will make it viable and will make money from it.” One assembly member said it would “create jobs, lots of people involved in the research side.”  Public support No assembly members made points in this area.  Safety and risk No assembly members made points in this area.  Other Some assembly members said it “has the right end goal” or that they “feel positively about the idea in theory, makes sense to me.” Others labelled it a “good idea in principle but [the] technology needs to develop” or a “good backup – continue to research into it…” Others said “what’s not to like from the concept? Removes carbon from the air no matter what the source” or “great if it works, could be a good idea, keep researching, but the main focus should be other areas.” Some assembly members commented: “What is wrong with spending money on it. You have to invest to make something work. I’d like to see Government step up and give it a go. Another potential benefit of the impact of Covid where we saw the impact of engineers on making ventilators – can’t we harness the same process.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  472  Cons Assembly members identified the following areas as points that they disliked about DACCS.  Environment impact and land use A significant number of assembly members said that DACCS is “not as natural as other options”, that they “prefer natural solutions” or that “if it saves the same amount as natural options, then would prefer the natural.” Others said that “it’s a gut instinct that it goes against nature”, that it “feels like trying to create technology to do what nature should do” or that we “should not need to be investing in new technologies when there are better solutions to minimise carbon release and maximise carbon storage naturally.” Some feared it “takes away the focus from natural processes available now - too many questions as to whether the technology can be invested in and developed in the long-term and whether in the end it can do what it intends” or suggested “this is just what a tree does – unless this is going to do the same job of thousands of trees, don’t think it’s worth it. Should just plant trees instead.” Another significant number of assembly members suggested that “we should try to reduce the carbon emissions, not just capture them once they’ve been emitted.” Others said it “seems like playing round the edges rather than tackling the problem of reducing emissions”, that it’s “like burying problems and putting your head in the sand”, that it “potentially lets companies off the hook from changing other practices” or that there’s “too much pushing of ‘carbon storing’ options which just kicks [the] can down the road. Need lifestyle changes instead, and the associated public information exercise.” Some assembly members said it “should not be used as an excuse to carry on using fossil fuels, need to find better ways forward”, that we’re “concern[ed] this will let us slip back to using more fossil fuels” or that it seems “reactive rather than proactive.” Similarly some registered “concern that it will be … treated as magic solution and we don’t do other important things before 2050.” Others noted “concern people are jumping on things that will create jobs, we should make sure it’s going to reduce carbon emissions to the extent we need it to.” Another significant number of assembly members disliked that it “needs a lot of energy”, the “energy it takes”, that it’s “very power intensive” or that it “requires electricity to run in the first place.” Others suggested that its “energy use can defeat [the] purpose” or that “this will need loads of CCS and the carbon capture uses lots of power so we might get into a spiralling situation.” Some noted it is “energy intensive to run so still needs to be fuelled – inefficacy”, that you “need power to run a pipe for the CO2” or that it “only works if using low carbon electricity sources, not if using high carbon electricity – requires lots of low carbon electricity.” Similarly, some said “this also relies on the energy used to power the technology being produced in a carbon neutral way, which may not be the case so seems counter-productive.” Some assembly members said they disliked the “land use implications”, that it “requires lots of land for the fans” or that it “takes up a lot of space that could be used for a lot of other things e.g. crops or forestry or houses.” Others asked “what about the land take (especially with take from wind farms)?” Some worried about “where will they be put, impact on people, land take, visual impact” or about “visual and noise impact.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  473  A number of assembly members felt there were “no multiple benefits (as with forests/peat)” or that the “only benefit with this one…[is] storing carbon” while “other options” had benefits including “biodiversity benefits from forests.” Some said “even BECCS” provides “energy you can use.” One assembly member suggested “it’s being pushed by big companies. It’s a back-up plan for moving away from oil, as profits go down from that. It’s a nice tidy way to dump things in the ocean.” Another referenced the “example of ‘enhanced oil recovery’ practices used since the 80s to enable access to further reserves of oil”, noting “concerns that this practice could be continued via this technology” and lead to increased emissions.  Practicality, efficiency, readiness and scale A very large number of assembly members commented on the newness of the technology. Suggestions included that it is: − Unproven and untested – “Tech isn’t proven yet” “Seems too simplistic, untried and untested. Sci fi.” “Not tested, not proven whether effective, not tested at a large scale” “Not practical and the technology is still unproven” “We don’t know if the technology works”; − Experimental – “Experimental “Very experimental” “Still experimental” “Still very experimental - a long way off, can’t really depend on it like you know you can depend on forests doing this – one for the future – rather than for now.” “Not convinced it will work and if we know enough as tech is new and experimental”; − Theoretical – “Very early stages (theoretical) and futuristic and not well understood” “It’s still theoretical. Not done on a large scale. Where can the carbon be stored reliably?” “Sounds too good to be true. It’s great in theory but not actually working.” “Technology is not there yet. Cautious about having air capture devices. Almost theoretical at the moment, might not be ready for the next 30 years. Not on the priority list”; − Not far enough developed – “Early technology so unsure if practical” “Not far enough developed to make a big impact” “The technology doesn’t exist yet” “Technology again. The technology is just not there yet” “New technology, not sure exactly how it works yet” “Too unknown”; − Far-fetched – “Sounds far fetched / a lot of unknowns” “Fanciful – seems like magic.” Some assembly members said simply that it was a “new method.” One said it was “vague.” Some assembly members queried “is it scalable?” or noted that we “can’t do it at the moment, at scale.” Some said it is “not practical for the short term” or is a “medium term option, but prioritise everything else. Putting all the resources in options we are not sure about is not the best idea.” Some assembly members said they were “sceptical they can get as much carbon as they say they can” or that they thought it would be “limited in terms of [the] amounts of CO2 that can be extracted.” Some commented that it is “very inefficient – has this just been pitched to make the other option (BECCS) more efficient? Don’t know why it’s on the list.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  474  Some assembly members suggested other options are better. Some said it “seems to have a lot of similarities with BECCS. BECCS could be better potentially. But it is hard to tell, still pretty theoretical.” Others said they were “not a convert. They have been looking at it for a while. Big investment: will take a long time to build. Could be worth investing, but it is so uncertain: but could be a huge amount of money. The other options are so much easier to reach net zero.” Some assembly members suggested there is “no commercial interest without Government sponsorship or investment” or that “one of the biggest problems with carbon capture was getting people to invest into it which has been the case for the last 20 years. Not sure if priorities on this have changed enough.” Individual assembly members said they “don’t see it as a very long term solution”, or that it’s “very difficult as the main place for capture will be at power stations.” One asked “where could these be sited? Would every village need one or would large industrial units need to be built to capture and store?”  Costs, the economy and jobs A large number of assembly members said it is “very expensive”, “expensive”, “high cost” or “likely to have a very high cost.” Some assembly members highlighted the “initial cost” or “cost of installation” in particular. Some assembly members disliked the combination of uncertainty and expense: “High cost – put the money into something [we’re] more sure will definitely work.” “More money and doesn’t have a guarantee of success.” Others suggested that the “money could be better spent in other areas” or that it “does the same job as a tree but [is] expensive.” Some asked “who will pay”, “would people be willing to pay”, or “who will initially gain and who pay?” Some said it’s “expensive – goes on our energy bill.” Others felt that “the cost of the energy that needs to be used for it makes it less effective than BECCS and so less viable” or said they were “not sure if [it is] cost effective yet as new technology.”  Public support One assembly member said it “can be done at scale (acknowledged) but [I] still don’t trust it.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  475  Safety and risk Some assembly members said that “storage of CO2 is not a good idea, worried about it escaping”, that they “wouldn’t feel confident that the carbon wouldn’t escape” or expressed concerns about the “risk of uncontrolled release of CO2 for future generations.” Some asked “how safe is the storage?”, “how long can it be stored for?” or noted they were “concerned about storing carbon in the earth’s crust – what impact will it have?” Others raised concerns about the “safety of carbon transport”, or said they “feel hesitant about carbon capture technology in general (this and BECCS).” Some assembly members expressed “concern about air suction, chemical processes, and mineral extraction – potential issues include safety, cost, jobs, how green.” Others listed “concerns about leakage and turning the water acidic”, “concern about unknown long-term impacts, e.g. air quality” or said we have “no idea of what the environmental impacts might be.”  Other One assembly member said they felt DACCS was a “waste of time”, another that it “feels like the option of last resort. Use it to mop up the last bits of CO2.” One assembly member said “we’ve got no information about the costs or about the quantity of CO2 removed.”6  Conditions Some assembly members noted conditions around direct air capture and carbon storage – points they felt would aid its implementation or that should be put in place. They suggested a need to:  Undertake research and development Some assembly members said that “research and development [are] needed”, that we should “look at it, but [it] needs more research” or that they “will go for anything that will work, even if it’s a small benefit – but it needs to be tried and tested.” Others said they see “value in exploring and investing in it alongside other options”, that “everything is new and experimental at some stage” or that “investment must be increased.” Similarly some said “maybe with more R&D they will come up with an acceptable solution. They have to start somewhere.” Others said they see “potential for further development” or that it’s an “option for [the] future but not so much now.”  6  Assembly members heard evidence about the relative cost of the different methods. It was not possible to give them the more precise figures requested because there are a range of plausible costs for direct CO2 removal methods. Methods also carry a variety of wider costs and benefits that hinder simple cost comparisons.  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  476  Only use it if it’s proven and affordable Some assembly members said they would support the idea “if the technology is there and proven”, that if it’s “proven to work and affordable then it’s a great idea” or that “if the tech to make it go solid comes in then brilliant.”  Manage costs Some said they would be in favour “if the cost is not too high”, while others said “if it doesn’t show itself to be viable then we will have to stop spending money on it.”  Use it in moderation only, or as a last resort (at least at first) Some assembly members said it “should only be used in moderation as a way of capturing that last bit of carbon that can’t be captured by a combination of natural methods of carbon storage and moves towards generating carbon neutral energy.” Others said it should be a “last resort solution – if nothing else works” or “only an interim measure while still using fossil fuels and other technologies are being developed.” Some commented that we “should be using natural approaches straight away as we know they will work and use these technologies in the background as over time we will understand them better, they will improve, cost may improve.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  477  Use a mix of options, potentially prioritising natural ones Some assembly members said “we shouldn’t shut down any option – there has to be a place for all options”, that we “need a balanced approach to capturing CO2; can’t rely on just one option” or that it “could be OK, but don’t put all eggs in one basket, priority should be natural measures.” Other assembly members commented that they “still think natural approaches are best but not sure they can be enough, this and BECCS have so much larger scope in potential BUT we don’t know that they definitely work.”  Don’t let it distract from better solutions Some assembly members warned to “[b]e careful that it doesn’t detract from other best practice approaches”, that “[i]f it is developed, it shouldn’t be an excuse to carry on using fossil fuels” or said that “[t]echnology is great, but humans need to start to taking responsibility for our impact on our surroundings.”  Individual assembly members made additional comments including:  “ Concerned about the carbon cost of setting this up and building the plant.” should be required to capture the CO they are responsible for generating, “ Companies as long as it’s regulated properly. They should be mandated to do this. But, don’t want 2  them to see this as a get out of jail free card and not do other things first. Will this mean a carbon trading scheme?”  “ If it does work, be sensitive to where they are put and the impact on people.” power to be used for this when it is available i.e. extra electricity generated “ byExcess the different technologies (e.g. nuclear now and wind/solar in future) be directed towards CC when not able to be used elsewhere.”  “ Can we join this with BECCS all in one place?” “ Needs to be beneficial in the long-term.” “ Need to be able to trust the scientists; we need to be sure they know what they are doing.” One assembly member said we can’t store electricity, but can store synthetic fuel. They said they had called “a company in Canada using this approach” who said it “can be scaled, but is currently expensive.” As seen in Section A, assembly members expressed limited support for direct air capture and carbon storage in their votes.  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  478  C. Cross-cutting considerations After discussing each of the six greenhouse gas removal methods in turn, assembly members had the chance to reflect on the methods overall. These notes and discussions didn’t tend to raise new issues. However they did emphasise the following points as important to significant numbers of assembly members:   A preference for ‘natural’ solutions – significant numbers of assembly members said they preferred the first four options, which they felt were more “natural.” Some also restated a variety of concerns about carbon storage;    The need for a combined approach – one group of assembly members noted “general agreement that instead of looking at a single solution we need to combine solutions, as well as changing our lifestyles.” A significant number of individual assembly members made similar points, including: of all of them: no single silver bullet. All techniques should work “ Combination together. I think these should all be part of the broad range of ways to reduce the carbon in the atmosphere.” I feel that all 6 options should be used. The first 4 methods would be dependent on the “ geographics and should be options at a local level. The options which include capture and storage would be better at a national level.” I think it has to be a combination of different methods on different scales rather than “ relying on one or two methods.”  A small number of assembly members commented more specifically on combining options involving trees and wood. For example: It would be a good idea to combine the tree-based options so it is completely efficient “ e.g. plant trees and then once they’ve matured we can cut them down for construction and once we need to take down the building we can use it as bioenergy and use BECCS.”   A wish to focus on reducing emissions, rather than capturing them afterwards – for example, comments included:  “ Need to concentrate on reducing carbon at source rather than capturing it.” “ The focus should be on producing less rather than offsetting.” We can’t just rely on removing carbon from the air we need to change how much “ we are putting in as well.” I think pursuing the technology of carbon capture through CCS, could make gas “ emissions seem more solvable, therefore acceptable, when we should be really focusing on using nature, renewables, reduction and change.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  479  There was also a significant, although slightly lesser, number of comments about the role that BECCS and DACCS could play. For example: natural solutions as far as possible. Then for the extra stuff we invest “ inI likethetheadditional technologies. All of them will be needed.” it is important to start with natural solutions which can start now and “ asI believe technology matures in carbon capture and storage we then take advantage.”  “ First two solutions – all for it but would like to see investment in the last two.” I believe we should adopt a blended approach at this stage and not depend on any “ specific solutions. When the CCS technology is more developed and cheaper we could employ more of this. Similar for direct air capture. All the approaches will require international co-operation and incentives to remove greenhouse gases.” One assembly member raised an additional point, noting that CO2 can be made into plastics and gravel, as well as synthetic fuels. They suggested that these options are also important for greenhouse gas removals.  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  480  Conclusions Removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere is a complex topic containing many uncertainties, and yet assembly members’ conclusions are in many ways clear and striking. Four greenhouse gas removal methods received significant support: forests and better forest management (99%), restoring and managing peatlands and wetlands, (85%), using wood in construction (82%) and, to a lesser extent, enhancing the storage of carbon in the soil (62%). These were the options that many assembly members felt were most “natural.” Assembly members also tended to see these options, particularly the first two, as having significant co-benefits. These included advantages around preventing flooding and erosion, increasing biodiversity, access to nature and enjoyment. Assembly members said they would like the implementation of these methods to be planned and managed well – for example, planting the right trees in the right places, managing forests properly, and minimising risks around the use of wood in construction. They also suggested a need to think about and support farmers, particularly in relation to restoring and managing peatlands and wetlands and enhancing the storage of carbon in the soil. Sustainability, including an aversion to importing trees and wood also came up a number of times. For some assembly members, thinking about the balance of land use was important too. The more technological or ”man-made” options of BECCS and DACCS secured lower rates of approval and higher rates of disapproval. 42% of assembly members ‘agreed’ or ‘strongly agreed’ that each of BECCS and DACCS should be part of how the UK gets to net zero, while 36% (BECCS) and 39% (DACCS) ‘disagreed’ or ‘strongly disagreed’. Many assembly members were worried about the risk of leaks from carbon storage sites. Many too felt that these options failed to address the problem. This was for a variety of reasons, including that they risked “tak[ing] the focus off the amount that we are emitting in the first place” and “kicking the can down the road.” Assembly members also voiced concerns around the methods being less natural, their costs, and the unproven nature of the technology, particularly in relation to DACCS. They noted the amount of energy used by DACCS and suggested this might be counterproductive. Whilst BECCS and DACCS therefore received limited support, some assembly members were keen that further research and development takes place, noting for example that these technologies could perhaps then be used more in the future or that they might be needed to “mop up” remaining CO2. In general, there was a feeling amongst assembly members that a combination of greenhouse gas removal methods would be needed.  Climate Assembly UK ― Greenhouse gas removals  481  Ch ap te r1 0  Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  Summary of recommendations 1 A large majority of assembly members (79%) ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that, ‘steps taken by the government to help the economy recover should be designed to help achieve net zero’. Their rationale included that the government should: limit, or put conditions on, investment in high carbon industries; make the most of the economic opportunities presented by the path to net zero; deal with Covid-19 and climate change together where possible and take advantage of the current opportunities for change. 2 Another large majority (93%) of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that, ‘as lockdown eases, government, employers and/or others should take steps to encourage lifestyles to change to be more compatible with reaching net zero’. Assembly members backed homeworking and changes to how we travel, and again noted that this “tough and sad time” presents an opportunity for change. They also saw a key role for government in providing leadership and information, alongside roles for business and local areas. 3 Assembly members tended to avoid expressing ‘strong’ views about whether or not Covid-19 and lockdown had made them think or feel differently about the how the UK should get to net zero.1 Their comments generally reflected the changed context created by Covid-19 rather than requests for alterations to specific recommendations made earlier in the assembly.  1  4 Overall assembly members agreed that their thoughts and feelings about the path to net zero in general had changed (62%). They talked about a new sense of opportunity for change, and altered perceptions of what is possible (e.g. what government can do). They also noted lifestyle changes that are already happening. Some highlighted the economic impacts of the pandemic, suggesting for example that they make reaching net zero more difficult. 5 73% of the assembly members who had looked at ‘how we travel’ during assembly weekends two and three said that Covid-19 and lockdown had changed their thoughts and feelings about how to get to net zero in this area. Key themes in their discussions included:   Changes happening to air travel, with some assembly members suggesting that people may continue to fly less;    Homeworking becoming more acceptable;    The impact on public transport, with people currently less willing to use it and questions about whether or not that will last long-term;    Increases in cycling and walking, although some questioned whether these would hold during the winter.  6 Only a minority of assembly members said that their thoughts and feelings had changed about the other topics discussed prior to lockdown.  They tended to choose ‘agree’ or ‘disagree’ in all four relevant votes, rather than ‘strongly agree’ or ‘strongly disagree’.  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  483  Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero The arrival of Covid-19 in the UK saw an additional item added to the assembly’s agenda. At the request of both Parliament and assembly members themselves, space was made for consideration of the changed context for reaching net zero created by the Covid-19 pandemic, and its impacts. The resulting session took place at the final assembly weekend on 16th May. At the time, strict lockdown measures were in place in all four UK nations.  What did the assembly consider? Assembly members did not hear detailed evidence on the changed context created by Covid-19. This was partly because of time constraints but also because it was too early in the pandemic for the type of detailed information the assembly had heard on other themes to be available. Instead the assembly heard one presentation from the Expert Leads2 that provided a series of think points for the assembly to discuss. The assembly then considered three questions:  2  1.  Whether or not steps taken by the government to help the economy recover should be designed to help achieve net zero;  2.  As lockdown eases, whether or not government, employers and/or others should take steps to encourage lifestyles to change to be more compatible with reaching net zero;  The content of the presentation was agreed by all four Expert Leads. It was given by Chris Stark, Committee on Climate Change (informant). An ‘informant’ is a speaker who we asked to cover the range of views and available evidence on a topic. As with all speakers’ presentations to the assembly, a video of the presentation is available at climateassembly.uk/resources/, alongside the accompanying slides and transcript.  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  484  3.  Whether or not Covid-19 and the lockdown had made them think or feel differently about how the UK should get to net zero. The assembly looked at this last question both in general terms, and in relation to the themes on which they had reached decisions prior to lockdown – ‘how we travel’, ‘in the home’, ‘what we eat and how we use the land’, and ‘what we buy’.3 After their discussions, they voted by secret ballot.  Assembly members’ views on these questions are significant. There is no other group that is at once representative of the UK population, and well-acquainted with the sorts of measures required to reach net zero.  The assembly’s interim briefing and what this chapter includes On 23rd June 2020 Climate Assembly UK released an interim briefing covering some of its recommendations on Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero in advance of Government announcements on these issues. These recommendations contributed to the Committee on Climate Change’s (CCC) Annual Progress Report to Parliament later the same month.4 The report presented the CCC’s advice to Parliament and Government about how the economic recovery from the pandemic can be made compatible with net zero. Part A of this chapter reproduces this interim briefing, which covered the assembly’s views on steps that should or should not be taken around the recovery from Covid-19. Part B moves on to look at whether or not Covid-19 and the lockdown have made assembly members think or feel differently about how the UK should get to net zero. Both sections start with the relevant vote results. They then move on to look at the reasons assembly members’ gave for their views.  Contents of this chapter A.

The recovery Assembly members discussed two questions linked to the recovery from Covid-19:   Whether or not steps taken by the government to help the economy recover should be designed to help achieve net zero;    As lockdown eases, whether or not government, employers and/or others should take steps to encourage lifestyles to change to be more compatible with reaching net zero.  After their discussions, they voted by secret ballot.  A.1 Vote results Assembly members took part in two different votes.

A large majority (93%) also ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that ‘as lockdown eases, government, employers and/or others should take steps to encourage lifestyles to change to be more compatible with reaching net zero (see the graph on the next page); 4% ‘strongly disagreed’ or ‘disagreed’.  A.2 Rationale Assembly members’ discussions prior to the vote shed light on the rationale behind their decisions, as do comments from their ballot papers. The results of the votes (above) show their final decisions.  A.2.1 Steps to help the economy recover Assembly members started by discussing ‘whether or not steps taken by the government to help the economy recover should be designed to help achieve net zero.’ We have grouped their comments under seven headings, for ease of navigation.  Limiting or putting conditions on investment in high carbon industries The idea most frequently mentioned by assembly members was limits to, or conditions on, investment in high carbon industries. Views included: money spent bailing out dying fossil fuel industries (the aviation industry, “ Any north sea oil) is money wasted on industries that won’t survive anyway.” I don’t think oil or gas companies should be given bailouts, you’re wanting to stop “ them anyway, so why support them – support the people who work for them but not the companies – that’s because they aren’t compatible with net zero.”  “ Shouldn’t actively fund the worst offenders.” Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  488  Yes opportunity to apply some pressure to industry and incentives must not prop “ up old systems.” an] incentive to manufacturers to go into green products, minimal support “ if[Provide not green.” Net zero should be one of the things that the Government is looking at for the economic “ recovery, alongside other things. For example, when negotiating bail outs or investment, ask for companies’ carbon footprint or put in place net zero requirements.” Depends on what big industries survive this – they’re going to ask for a lot of money. “ Government shouldn’t give it too easily. Should have conditions which are green related along with any bailout. Air France agreed to climate change regulation – that’s a good way to do it. One condition would be to get industry to invest in particular technology.” It would be too easy to just carry on as before and to take advantage of cheap oil and “ other special offers e.g. cheap travel, cheap clothes, factories churning out cheap goods to ‘get the economy going’. We need incentives to reduce emissions, to improve [the] quality and longevity of products. We need penalties for people who do not consider the environment when building or rebuilding businesses.” companies who provide climate enhancing services and not climate “ Assist harming services.” Some assembly members disagreed with the above or added caveats. For example: Where strings can be attached, do. But…support the economy in areas which “ lose jobs, like should have happened with the coal mines.”  “ Retraining is important.” “ Some worry about highly trained people … aviation: how are they going to find jobs.” bail out some industries that are less green in the short term, “ soYouthatmayyouhavecantoinvest in greener areas in the longer term.” It [helping to get to net zero] should be a factor but not the be all and end all. To rule “ something out just because it doesn’t help net zero is too extreme – e.g. letting airlines go to the wall.”  “ All industries have a right to succeed and people have a right to be employed.” may be a necessary evil otherwise the economy will fail. We need “ toBailouts support what we have in order to survive.” “ Some fossil fuel sectors bring in a lot of money so it’s hard not to support them.” “ Bail outs are helpful for small business.” “ Concern about knock-on effects on supply chains – airports etc.” Some assembly members made different but related points, for example: lock in of fossil fuel use [is] key – best chance to do this is now to avoid going “ Avoiding back into the trap of fossil fuels again. That would be disappointing.“  “ Because oil is cheap – put a tax on oil.” Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  489  Rethinking and investing in infrastructure One of the most frequently made points related to rethinking and investing in infrastructure. Some comments here were general, for example: is an opportunity to rethink infrastructure practically and in a net zero “ This friendly [way].” must steer in the right direction, with the right objectives – after emergency, “ Government focus is on infrastructure. So this is a prime time for Government action, and for the right investment in the right places.” Others noted more specific ideas – for example, around building insulation, offshore wind, e-vehicles and related infrastructure, broadband, cycling, solar for new builds, safer public transport (e.g. “taxis that have screens and hygiene security’), batteries for energy storage and online libraries to facilitate home study. A small number of assembly members mentioned types of infrastructure where they would not want to see investment – for example “less road building”, “no new airport runways.”  Supporting low carbon industries Some assembly members said they would like to see investment in low carbon industries. Overlapping with the points made about infrastructure, assembly members mentioned sectors including the renewables industries (e.g. “Government should bring back incentives for renewables”), “development and deployment” of electric vehicles (e.g. “make them cheaper but allow people choice”), and heat pumps. Other related points included: If people [members of the public] are shorter of money they’re not going to be able to do “ that [invest in steps that help get to net zero]. Interest free loans? Costs coming down?” Feels [like] government should bail out companies with green plans, and in turn their “ taxes will fund the government.”  Reaching net zero is an economic opportunity Some assembly members suggested that there are economic opportunities on the path to net zero. Views included: It’s not an either-or matter [economy – climate change] can spend on technologies like “ wind turbines, for example, that provide jobs and help the economy to recover.” Investing public money – everything we do in terms of net zero has got to be approached “ from an economic point of view i.e. it needs also to help bring money into the country as much as help to reach the net zero target – and this is possible in spending on projects such as renewable technologies and being able to ‘export’ the knowledge and technology to others.” It’s an opportunity to encourage new businesses, kick start with renewable energy “ businesses to get to net zero.” Use this to our benefit – mix together economic recovery and achieving net zero to get “ what we need.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  490  Yes – it’s a perfect opportunity, create new work for job losses, new skills for example in “ turbine installing and manufacturing and make them in this country.” investment in things like wind turbines not only help us get to our net zero target, “ Any but it creates jobs and spends the money in the UK which gets money flowing in the economy and helps us both create jobs and increase demand side spending. This is a win/ win situation.”  “ We need a green industrial revolution.” Tackling Covid-19 and climate change together On a similar theme to the last heading, some assembly members said they didn’t feel a choice needed to be made between dealing with the current situation and meeting climate targets. Comments included: Feels that climate change is as big a crisis as Covid-19, e.g. wild fires across the world, “ famine, air pollution. Don’t want the government to put climate change on the back burner because of Covid-19.” With planning and a bit of structure we can tackle both climate and Covid-19. “ We shouldn’t go back to where we were before.”  “ Yes, we should integrate our recovery with green steps, because it’s do-able.” Well it seems pretty silly to try [to] save the economy whilst shirking from problem “ solvers [albeit]…because of the costs. I understand we need to hopefully tackle this economic crisis, but it would make sense to incorporate both issues into one as we have made an agreement to hit net zero as that is beneficial for the future. I don’t want to be known as a coward when faced with these issues, and bury my head in the sand. It just doesn’t make the issues change or go away.” Others emphasised the continued importance of the net zero target, saying for example: I am very concerned that the Covid-19 pandemic will push the net zero target further “ down the agenda of public policy and this should not be allowed to happen. Net zero should be at the forefront of the policy priorities going forward and should be woven in to each aspect of the recovery. The benefits of doing this (and the risks of not doing this) should be emphasised to the public at every opportunity so that individuals and employers … also make the best decisions when returning to ‘normal’ life.”  Taking the opportunity for change Some assembly members felt that the current economic challenges presented an opportunity to do things differently. Rationales included: It’s the way back – economy has to restart, government has an opportunity where people “ are waiting to get back to normal. There’s not [an] other better time.” Biggest investments were made after the war (i.e. another time when economic recovery “ was needed) – fundamentally changed things e.g. education, health, housing. Massive investment but it was needed to push us in the right direction.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  491  Government is being forced to think up the best way forward so [it] can incorporate “ The new ways of thinking.” public is learning how to deal with change and we should take advantage of this “ The developing attitude to introduce and enact the substantial changes that will be required.”  “ It’s a good opportunity to try to change attitudes.” is a current public consciousness to climate change and people will be more “ There accepting of change after an event which had such a devastating effect on the global economy and society.”  Caveats, uncertainty and disagreement Assembly members who chose ‘unsure / don’t know’ in the vote, made the following points on their ballot papers: government needs to get the economy back up and running. Climate change should “ The not be put on back burner until [the] economy picks up. It should be addressed and preferably integrated into our recovery”  “ In an ideal world yes. I am sure they will have to help business get back on their feet first.” “ The country has to be successful for its citizens to thrive so this has to be balanced.” really depends on how long the current situation lasts and the state of the global “ This economy when things improve.” Assembly members who ‘disagreed’ or ‘strongly disagreed’ that ‘steps taken by the government to help the economy recover should be designed to help achieve net zero’ made the following points on their ballot papers: this will not happen as there is going to be a catastrophic depression that will “ Again, change matters.”  “ This will only hinder the recovery.” I do not think that [the] steps government takes to help the economy recover should be “ specifically designed to help achieve net zero. If support is needed and it does not meet the requirement of achieving net zero that should not mean it is disregarded. Many more factors should be considered when this decision is made.” think coronavirus is a real crisis, and the steps taken to deal with it have been severe. “ II am not convinced that the climate ‘crisis’ is in comparison a real crisis, and I think it is in many ways a confected crisis. I do not think the science is ‘settled’ with regards to the impacts of man, and our increasing CO2 emissions on the global climate, although I do believe we each have a personal responsibility to live our lives as sustainably as possible. In this regard, I do believe the government can play a role, and positively encourage us to take personal responsibility to live our lives more sustainably. In addition, I think we have to be realistic on what as a nation we can achieve. As far as the UK is concerned, we only contribute around 1% of global CO2 emissions, so the priority should probably be on rebuilding our economy post coronavirus, as opposed to inflecting greater economic self harm through expensive green initiatives, that will have negligible benefit.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  492  Five assembly members who ‘agreed’ that steps taken by the government to help the economy recover should be designed to help achieve net zero noted caveats on their ballot papers too. These assembly members said: Balancing action – there will be a need to formulate a path that will aid the “ economic recovery.”  “ Agree, but possible to over-do it. A balance needs to be kept.” “ …but not in any way that risks the recovery.” there should be a focus on balancing the budget and reducing the deficit “ Obviously first. Keeping interest rates low to not crowd out private industry and to try and restore jobs lost. The government should initially encourage a market-led approach in this time with changes to regulation and after recovery focus on government led infrastructure projects.” If the opportunity arises to help the economy recover and also to achieve net zero, “ then the government should take it. However as the country is likely to be in a difficult financial position, it should think carefully before investing in anything and ensure the results will be beneficial.” Some assembly members also raised caveats during discussions. For example: not a nanny state, government shouldn’t tell us what to do. But incentive should “ beWe’re there, just not dictating.” “Personal responsibility is key.” Feels economy will get much worse before it gets better. There’s so much uncertainty “ around Covid-19 and still need to wait and see.”  “ Not keen on big schemes right now as they may not be used a lot after this is over.” A.2.2 Steps to encourage lifestyles to change Assembly members discussed what should happen as lockdown eases. Specifically they considered whether or not ‘government, employers and/or others should take steps to encourage lifestyles to change to be more compatible with reaching net zero’. We have grouped their comments under six headings, for ease of navigation.  Encouraging homeworking Homeworking was one of the most commonly mentioned themes. Assembly members’ views included: is brilliant – less traffic, less flights, quicker – government has to encourage “ itHomeworking somehow either with incentives or penalties.” have adapted by helping workers to work from home where possible I feel “ Asthisemployers should be encouraged.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  493  For people who can work from home, and have been able to demonstrate that they can “ still be productive, companies will be more willing to allow this to continue, and this will reduce the volume of traffic / emissions on our roads. The government could send encouraging messages in this regard.” I think especially for businesses they can encourage lifestyle changes through working “ from home and therefore less commuting. This would help with a reduction in driving and surface transport. It may also mean office spaces can be smaller and therefore businesses will be less polluting in the resources they use.” could have smaller offices, smaller heating, air conditioning and energy bills. “ Companies They could use these savings to give extra benefits and incentives to their employees to help insulate and heat their homes and pay for the changes that may be needed to reach net zero. This could be a tax free Government backed initiative.” think it should be forced. No one should tell people what to do, or never to go back “ toI don’t work, but I think people should have the options to work from home and travel less.” lockdown has proven that in the modern world work doesn’t have to fit such a robust “ The schedule, particularly in white collar jobs. It is very very possible to continue a remote working world to permanently ease congestion and improve life quality.” Homeworking should be encouraged: saves time, less commuting; businesses having “ seen it is possible; it won’t be hard for people to adapt to; I’ll be able to get a dog!”  Encouraging changes to how we travel Assembly members also frequently mentioned changes to how we travel, particularly in relation to: (1) encouraging and incentivising cycling, making it safer and providing proper infrastructure; (2) a reduced need for business travel, particularly flying. Assembly members’ views included: People should be encouraged to continue walking, running or cycling every day, “ and this hopefully would cut down on the use of cars for short journeys.” will require the government and employers to work together to ensure that “ This everyone can go about their lives safely. This will mean massive investments in bicycle networks and walkable city streets. This will allow people to move safely, as well as lead to a healthier population and workforce who will be better able to fight the virus.” to Work scheme is for health and the environment. Yes, the government should “ Cycle do things. There’s a mandate to do so. They can’t use [the idea that we won’t listen] as an excuse now, people do listen, especially if the incentives are good.” should encourage businesses to consider remote video calls/working rather “ …government than regular domestic / international business flights, which they’ll probably begin to do anyway as in the future it may not make financial sense to fly in the way they have been doing before (less airlines operating means less choice, means potentially higher costs)…” I think that an employer or the government might look at video conferencing rather than “ flying or staying overnight in a hotel as a cheaper option which might also help climate change. This should be encouraged if it will also help in reaching net zero.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  494  It would be a missed opportunity for the government, employers and individuals [to] “ not take advantage of our aim to achieve net zero as lockdown eases. Everyone has had to adapt to a different lifestyle and certain elements of the lockdown – travelling by land and air – should see a permanent reduction if we change our working practices and how often we really need to take flights.”  Taking the opportunity for change Assembly members recognised that Covid-19 has created a “tough and sad time” and several have been severely personally affected. They did however also note an “opportunity” for change in both lifestyles and how the economy works. Assembly members who voted ‘strongly agree’ made this type of comment frequently: is a great opportunity to restart the economy on a greener pathway and such “ There chances should be seized upon.” Because there is going to have to be big changes for the economy to recover and if we can “ tie net zero aims into everything that happens on this then it is a great opportunity” huge mind-set change has occurred. This is an ideal opportunity to incorporate the “ Aassumption that any changes implemented should be compatible with n[et] zero.”  “ Change has already begun which is a first step and can be built on.” Now is the time when people are ready to adapt. It’s harder to get people to adapt when “ they are stuck in their ways.” People have seen how it is not that difficult to make simple changes like work from home “ more often so this is the best opportunity to introduce changes that will help us reach net zero.” We have momentum, there is an opportunity to change things for the better during this “ time of adjustment and flux. This is a window that we must use before people become weary of more change and exhausted by further upheaval.” It’s important that we utilize this period of transition and inactivity in certain “ sectors to reinvent the way our country functions in order to make it more environmentally friendly.” Some assembly members also described the current situation as a “huge wakeup call.” Related comments included: has been a salutary warning that homo sapiens are not in total control “ Covid-19 of the environment and are not omniscient.” it [net zero] should be at the centre of government policy. It’s about flexibility – “ Think you need to be prepared for things that are looming. We should start early and make the most of the momentum.” Others said “it’s the only way to achieve net zero”, “it’s better for everyone if we embrace it”, or asked “why on earth wouldn’t they.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  495  Providing leadership and information Many assembly members also made suggestions about roles. In terms of the Government’s role, comments included: Has to be an onus to do this – some businesses will change, but many will be focused on “ the bottom line. Has to come from the Government, plus people power / public support. A quiet revolution.”  “ Government needs to shape the narrative.” are going to have the largest impact on people’s lifestyle, so they need to take “ Government the lead. And they are the ones who can invest in new ways of doing things to stimulate demand for it.” government needs to start somewhere – a mix of government and private investment “ The beyond us just all doing our bit.” is an opportunity to get people to change, and it is important for government “ This to lead that change.” why we have government! We expect them to guide us. I hope they’ll learn “ That’s from the pandemic.” Some assembly members also made comments about information provision, for example: could communicate with every household the way they’ve done “ Government with coronavirus.” should inform all households of ways to change lifestyles to aid “ Government [the] environment.” coronavirus crisis has shown that the public will respond to changes if they have “ The sound, clear and trustworthy information and explanation as provided by our scientific advisers throughout the epidemic.” Employers can reduce overheads by people working from home (and meeting from “ home instead of flying round the world), and the government should build on people’s experience of being advised by regularly promoting this message.” Assembly members also talked about the role of businesses. Some suggested changes that businesses could make, for example “provid[ing] incentives to work from home” or “provid[ing] showers/changing rooms so people can cycle to work and tidy themselves up afterwards.” Others suggested that change was in businesses’ interests because they “will want to reduce overheads” or because they “already value their environmental reputation.” Some felt that change is already underway: Experience is that all talk between [the] business and [the] trade union is about how “ [they are] going to do things differently around this.” Others said there “is no reason not to when they have been able to manage so far e.g. less business travel, more homeworking” or that “even if 30% of businesses make a change, it could make a difference.” Some suggested that there is a need for government to incentivise change  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  496  or an “opportunity for government to advertise to business [the] benefits of being greener e.g. reducing travel.” Some assembly members said that we “need to concentrate on local change, as well as national” or that “Government should [take steps to encourage lifestyle change], and local authorities too. People did take notice [during the lockdown] so they do have influence and people will listen [to them].”  Points made less frequently Points made by smaller numbers of assembly members included the following.  Encouraging healthier lifestyles Some assembly members felt that steps should be taken to encourage healthier lifestyles, with some noting that conditions like diabetes and obesity put people more at risk from Covid-19. These comments tended to focus either on transport – for example “encourage walking / cycling which is good for the public health where it is possible to do so” – or diets: Now is a really good chance to tie-in the way we eat with net zero, obesity etc, “ prevalence of take-aways, how badly we eat in this country, how much we waste.”  Supporting individual choice and differing needs Some assembly members talked about the importance of allowing individual choice and catering for different needs. Comments included: by example but the reality is that it’s in an individual’s choice – to follow or not “ –Leading giving the opportunity to help individuals to make the right choice by providing all the information / resources to make those choices.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  497  How changes are introduced is key and need to find a balanced approach that recognises “ the needs of different people – cannot be one size fits all.” Feel like there’ll be two halves – those who are able to make these changes to how they work “ (conference calling etc and this will also open up job opportunities for those who otherwise would not be able to – physical limitations) and then there are those whose lives are linked to social interaction e.g. a yoga teacher who needs to interact with their participants, or teachers in schools – hard to socially distance in these settings. Or for those for whom social interaction is important for their mental health and wellbeing. These sorts of circumstances will have a bearing on how people change or not. Needs an awful lot of thought to what is possible or not possible and both have to be solved mutually – one cannot be to the detriment of the other.”  “ These should only be suggestions, and incentives to encourage a lower carbon footprint.” One assembly member said that change should be “encouraged yes, forced no.”  Providing incentives Some assembly members said there should “100%...be incentives/penalties – people won’t do things just by themselves. If everyone is doing it then people will do it – if it’s clear for people to follow.” Similar comments included:  “ Need incentives to encourage people to do the right things – what’s in it for them?” But will have ‘to bribe people’ e.g. enhanced bike to work schemes and make it really “ obvious and easy.” Many people want to change but will be carried along by others who do not “ understand or who are not aware of the impending problems.”  Promoting green industry and jobs Some assembly members suggested this is a “great opportunity to push green industries, new industries – focus on these in the future and not go back to dying industries. And for those who have lost jobs provide the means to re-train and gain jobs in these areas.” Others mentioned specific industries that they would like to see supported, or suggested that “if businesses [are] not green then government should not help them but find other ways for people to be employed.”  Disagreement, uncertainty and caveats A small number of assembly members disagreed or strongly disagreed that ‘government, employers and others should take steps as lockdown eases to encourage lifestyles to change to be more compatible with reaching net zero.’ These assembly members said we need to “make plans for long term changes”, that “we have come out of “Total Lock-Down’ too soon” or that it “will not be foremost in their [government, employers] expectations.” Some assembly members also felt strongly that it was too early to be discussing what should happen next at this stage of the pandemic. Assembly members who voted “don’t know / unsure” said: the moment the focus will be on tackling the virus and finding a vaccine. As we regain “ Atcontrol though, the government should assess and plan what changes need to take place.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  498  very difficult to say if governments, employers or others should change as it depends “ onIt ishow they were acting before and governments and employers don’t necessarily have the same opportunities to make changes.” really depends on how long the current situation lasts and the state of the global “ This economy when things improve.” Assembly members who agreed that government, employers and others should take steps to encourage lifestyles to change also had some caveats. Individual assembly members said they “agree, but possible to over-do it. A balance needs to be kept” or “only where it makes economic sense. The economy must take priority over the global CO2 agenda.” Other individuals said it “should not affect reductions in people’s incomes” or that we need to “be careful how we do it because the economy is in rough shape. Unemployment needs addressing in the short term.”  Conclusions – the recovery A large majority of assembly members (79%) ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that ‘steps taken by the government to help the economy recover should be designed to help achieve net zero’. When giving their rationale, assembly members most frequently recommended that the government:   Limit, or put conditions on, investment in high carbon industries;5    Rethink and invest in infrastructure;    Support low carbon industries;    Make the most of the economic opportunities presented by the path to net zero;    Deal with Covid-19 and climate change together where possible;    Take advantage of the current opportunities for change.  Assembly members who were unsure or who disagreed with the statement tended to emphasise a need to focus on economic recovery first and foremost. Another large majority (93%) of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that, ‘as lockdown eases, government, employers and/or others should take steps to encourage lifestyles to change to be more compatible with reaching net zero’. Assembly members’ rationale included:  5    A desire for government, employers and/or others to encourage homeworking and changes to how we travel;    A feeling that the current “tough and sad time” presents an opportunity for change that should be taken;    A suggestion that the government should provide leadership and information, alongside roles for business and local areas.  This was both the most frequently given rationale and the most controversial.  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  499  B. Impact on the assembly’s thinking In the second half of their discussions, assembly members considered whether or not Covid-19 and the lockdown had made them think or feel differently about how the UK should get to net zero, and why. Assembly members discussed this question:   In general;    For the themes on which they had reached decisions prior to lockdown – ‘how we travel’, ‘in the home’, ‘what we eat and how we use the land’, and ‘what we buy’.  After their discussions, they voted by secret ballot.  B.1 Vote results Assembly members took part in four different votes.6  Figure 3  Thinking about how to get to net zero in general, how much do you agree or disagree with the following statement: “The experience of coronavirus and the lockdown has made me think / feel differently about how the UK should get to net zero” (%) % 50  44%  25  17%  20% 8%  12% 0 Strongly agree  6  Agree  Don’t know / unsure  Disagree  Strongly disagree  All assembly members took part in the vote about whether Covid-19 and the lockdown had made them think or feel differently about how the UK should get to net zero in general. For the other three votes, just the assembly members who had looked at the relevant theme in detail participated. So, for example, only those who had examined ‘in the home’ in-depth voted on whether their views on heat and energy use in the home had changed.

However the impact on assembly members’ thoughts and feelings varied by topic. The biggest impact was on views about ‘how we travel’:   73% of the assembly members who looked at this topic said that Covid-19 and lockdown had changed their thoughts and feelings about the path to net zero in this area;    19% ‘strongly disagreed’ or ‘disagreed’ that this was the case;  For the other topics, a minority of assembly members said their thoughts and feelings had changed. Assembly members’ views on heat and energy use ‘in the home’ were the least affected:   35% of assembly members reported that their thoughts and feelings about the path to net zero for heat and energy use in the home had changed;    39% ‘strongly disagreed’ or ‘disagreed’;    26% said they ‘didn’t know’ or were ‘unsure’;  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  502  For assembly members looking at ‘what we eat and how we use the land’ and ‘what we buy’:   36% said their thoughts or feelings about how to get to net zero in these areas had changed;    26% ‘strongly disagreed’ or ‘disagreed’;    37% ‘didn’t know’ or said they were ‘unsure.  Across all the votes, assembly members tended to avoid expressing ‘strong’ views, choosing ‘agree’ or ‘disagree’ rather than ‘strongly agree’ or ‘strongly disagree’. This may reflect the uncertainties and emerging nature of the current situation.  B.2 Rationale Assembly members’ discussions prior to the vote shed light on the rationale behind their decisons, as do comments from their ballot papers. The results of the votes (reported above) show assembly members’ final decisions.  B.2.1 In general Assembly members began by discussing ways in which their thoughts and feelings about how to get to net zero in general had or hadn’t changed, and why.  Ways in which thoughts and feelings had changed, and why We have divided assembly members’ comments into ten overlapping categories to make them easier to navigate.  A wake-up call Some assembly members said that Covid-19 “has been a bit of a wake-up call – we’d got complacent that bad things don’t happen.” Thoughts included: “[I] realise it’s much more important [now] – this catastrophe is easier to deal with than climate change.” “Learnt that delay is dangerous – it will hurt us if we do not act.” “Covid-19 has shown the old ways of thinking and doing things are not going to work anymore, and this has been a wake-up call that how we’ve been living isn’t sustainable.” “Believe even more strongly that we need to do something and not be unprepared for the climate crisis.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  503  Some assembly members highlighted the visible changes to the environment that have happened during lockdown: “Seeing how excited people have been about wildlife popping up in different places / dolphins in Venice – … maybe this is a way of encouraging people to make the changes needed.” “More obvious to me how much the environment is affected by emissions e.g. clear blue skies we’ve had. Even the clouds are brighter. The lack of traffic and cars.” “Challenge to climate change deniers because climate change is usually invisible – but has now been made visible. So [we] need to carry on some of the changes.”  An opportunity for change Some assembly members talked about a sense of opportunity. Some assembly members made general observations saying “it’s a great opportunity to grasp the nettle” or “it’s an opportunity to shift.” Comments included: “The world is going to be completely different, we just have to adapt and adjust – we cannot accept normal being as it was – this is an opportunity.” “Covid-19 is an opportunity to start things in a completely different way, a fresh start, rather than going back to the way we’ve been operating before.” “It’s an opportunity for Government to move forward faster. Young people are talking about our environment; they are affected and they can see the difference. Mustn’t go back to the way we were. Grasp the opportunity, take the good out of the bad. Keep people onside and bring them with you.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  504  Some assembly members’ comments were more specific: “This is an opportunity to continue on with massive investment…. Introduce a climate emergency department that works closely with industry to develop new technologies/ approaches.” “Feasibility of large infrastructure has increased.” “Chance to redevelop the social structure in an environmentally friendly way.” “Opportunities to ‘nudge’ behaviour.” “We can incorporate green changes into our recovery from coronavirus. It doesn’t necessarily require grand investments. Making small changes in our homes will be easier than changing the way we travel. Feel we should be making gradual steps anyway. The door has opened to this.” Some assembly members reported that they now “feel more hopeful [about tackling climate change]”: “Shows how quickly change can be implemented if there’s a will. Has given hope that we can make quick changes. Feels like it might be possible to achieve net zero. Has made me feel more positive.” “Are [we] seeing the first shoots of a possible future world.” Others said that “significant change seems more likely” or that “totally unexpected things can happen.”  What government can do Some assembly members reported changed views about what government can do: “Much more is possible now than what I had thought beforehand because it’s shown that things can be done. Just seeing what the government has agreed to….” “How quickly Government can act when needed – shows that change is possible.” “Ability of Government to act on scientific advice” “There is a magic money tree.” “Government can make radical changes when necessary so maybe [they] need to make similar sweeping radical changes to the climate change agenda too. See climate change though the same lens as Covid-19 (an emergency). [I] feel it’s far more realistic that we can begin making vast changes now; introduce them now as we’ve got used to a very different way of life anyway.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  505  People’s willingness to change Some assembly members suggested that “people have more willingness to change now” or said they had had been surprised by people’s willingness to change. Views included: “Think [the] response from [the] public to [the] changes required to reduce emissions will be easier – they’ll now be more open-minded to change.” “We’re at a brink where we can change individually – think differently about what we need in our lives.” “It’s made people reassess what is important.” “The lockdown will help with lifestyle changes: it’s shown what is possible.” “People are willing to do things and the government is telling us what to do. People are more willing than I thought they would be.” Relatedly, some assembly members talked about the role of information in making change possible: “Shows good leadership and information can make change happen.” “Shows [the] impact of top down messages.” “People will act differently if they know why” “More important to make people aware of [the] impending climate crisis – [we] can work together if we feel threatened.” “Coronavirus – daily reports – crucial to do the same for climate change.” “It’s more about reinforcement of the message/issue – media coverage – so much on Covid-19. [What] [i]f that model can be used for that level of coverage – e.g. daily carbon tracker on where we are in terms of heading towards net zero.”  Lifestyle changes that have already happened Some assembly members talked about lifestyle changes that have already happened, and suggested that they had altered their thoughts or feelings. Some focussed on health or mental health: “The kids are really healthy.” “Kids are more relaxed, and love learning at home.” “Stress and mental health impacts of coronavirus, plus loss of jobs – siege mentality, building walls – will affect how we approach climate change / the society we live in when we tackle climate change.” “[We need] more focus on resourcing mental health support [around changes like this].” “Can’t see the grandparents in England; the lockdown has a very emotional and personal impact.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  506  Some assembly members highlighted changes to what we buy and how we buy it as impacting on their views: “Buying locally – farm shops are becoming popular.” “Shopped in local shops instead of supermarkets. Only used the car once a week. Don’t want to use the car anymore. […] You become smarter at doing things. Our overall consumption has been reduced. Not spending as much money at all.” ”Shopping habits have changed and will stay (e.g. transition to once a week shop).” “People have realised they don’t have to go shopping every day and drive their car, although behaviour is already starting to revert back to what it was before lockdown.” “Focus more on children and schools, especially reducing what we want / buy – more urgent to do this now than before.” Some assembly members mentioned the influence of changes to what we eat or the energy we use on their thinking: “People are more interested in food. This is linked to working from home. People used to go out to eat for lunch. There could be implications for healthy eating. We are eating lunches now as a family.” “It has been a good way to show people how to reduce their impact, for example not wasting food when making meals.” “People [are] at home and cooking more.” “We are using more gas and electric at home for cooking.” “We are using more electricity at home. We don’t know what the future holds. There will be change, but not sure what exactly.” One assembly member said “if this is how my lifestyle needs to change, then I don’t want it.”  For a fuller discussion of assembly members’ thoughts on these issues, please see:   Section B.2.3 on heat and energy use in the home, page 520;    Section B.2.4 on ‘what we eat and how we use the land’ and ‘what we buy’, page 524.  Commuting and homeworking The most frequently mentioned way in which assembly members said their views had changed related to the shift from commuting to homeworking: “Finding working from home doable and therefore flying, driving or trains for meetings [are] not necessary.” “Working at home is nice: we go for walks with the family. Let’s fix the world! More clear that we need to sort everything out.” “Working from home could be implemented by a lot of companies.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  507  “People and businesses have adapted to a new world, e.g. shown that we can work from home, e.g. twitter staff will now be working from home.” “It has shown that working from home is more viable. It can support a transition to more homeworking.” “Reducing emissions from commuting is important and people have been making compromises.” “Views have changed: changes in transport behaviour [are] very good – reduction in emissions – thin[k] a lot of it will stick – people have more time now as well, not having to commute.” “Coronavirus is going to be here for a long time, people will keep working from home – people might move out of cities as they’re expensive … – reduced congestion in cities….” Some added that “there is a psychological impact currently, but take away the pandemic and working from home will be a positive change.” Others said “companies will be able to save money on rental costs and energy bills” or that “Government should continue to push the message regarding working from home.”  For a fuller discussion of assembly members’ thoughts on these issues, please see Section B.2.2 on ‘how we travel’, page 514.  How we travel In addition to comments on homeworking, some assembly members talked about other aspects of how we travel and changes to their thoughts or feelings. Comments about aviation included: “We can’t fly. I would normally fly 3 times a year to go on holidays, but this lockdown has made me think about flying.” “[I] feel a bit different to others. Feel this is going to be the death knell of the airline industry and probably public transport as well (not sure if people will use it to the same extent as before due to on-going concerns of the impact of being in close proximity to others). [I] feel people will think climate change is a luxury, a nice to have, but actually we need to get the economy going in some way and pay off the debts that we’ve all racked up. So, I don’t feel as positive as the others.” “We were expecting airlines to pay for new technologies, but they may not be able to afford to invest in these technologies.” One assembly member who farms and owns holiday cottages noted that “bookings have gone through the roof – people holidaying in the UK, in the countryside in much greater numbers than in previous years.” Others said that the “aviation industry will take years to recover, and people may end up holidaying in the UK.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  508  On cars, some assembly members talked about the “impact of low petrol prices because the government won’t want to increase taxes and people feel that the car is safer.” Others said they were “worried that the government is telling us to use our cars” or said “it is important to reflect on the changes e.g car usage has come right down, which is great. We don’t travel as much, but concerned about the next few months, especially when the weather turns bad, which will push people back into their cars.” Some noted “reduced congestion” or said we should “aim to maintain the reduction in travel.” On walking and cycling, some assembly members talked about an “increase in cycling”, “pedestrianisation of town / city centres” or a “heightened belief amongst people that there are alternatives – e.g. cycles, scooters, cycle lanes.” Some cautioned that “in any alternatives, be aware of sectors of society that might be disadvantaged by that uplift (e.g. visually impaired people and electric scooters).” Some assembly members said that they “now feel more strongly that we should invest in low CO2 public transport”, or that “more can be done now about travel – trains and changing how city centres are used.” Others were more cautious, saying “I’m still keen on public transport, but re-evaluating now (worried about catching the virus)” or that the “pictures of London’s buses are shocking – I’m worried about it spreading so will jump in a car.”  For a fuller discussion of assembly members’ thoughts on these issues, please see Section B.2.2 on ‘how we travel’, page 514.  New economic priorities and challenges Some assembly members said that the economic implications of Covid-19 present new challenges on the path to net zero: “Coronavirus is the most damaging economic thing post war. Debt will be astronomical. Not sure we can recover from it, so feeling more pessimistic about [our] ability to reduce emissions.” “The recession will have grave consequences for the climate.” “Funding will be a major problem – we could be set back 10 years.” “Biggest worry is how people are coping with this, e.g. my business is being affected. How are we going to construct the green infrastructure if supply-chain businesses fail?” “Concern about how sustainable this is. How it will affect the economy, real issue of inflation – collapse of the pound. Currently we’re ok as we’re in the same boat as every other nation. [What will happen] [w]hen inflation starts kicking in and we can’t afford the things we can at the moment.” Some assembly members said that they now see reaching net zero as less of a priority: “Want to see things back as they were, so maybe net zero takes a back seat to people just needing to put food on the table.” “Perhaps we can only afford to take small steps towards net zero until we are back on our feet financially.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  509  “This [the virus] is the priority now.” “People need to be able to survive short term first, then [we can] look at [the] bigger target of net zero, and look at opportunities there.” “It [net zero] may be harder to achieve as Government have other pressing problems. They will need to focus in other areas, rather than net zero.” Others suggested that “perhaps we need to focus on net zero options that are cheap in the short term and bring money back short term – e.g. direct air capture and storage [are] probably less feasible now.” Some expressed “increased concerns about the finances and the finances of ideas that need more [money] – have we spent it all?”  Opportunities for a green recovery Some assembly members suggested that the current situation presents a “chance to stimulate the economy through a green revolution”: “Economy has come to a standstill and now we’re going to have to rebuild the economy and we’ve got a choice about how we re-build – can go back to the same as before or we can decide to invest more in wind turbines, large public infrastructure projects….” “There are big financial implications. Where will the money come from? […] They should find the money to fix the planet. Rewrite the economic system. Fix the world for good.” “Need to examine the way we run as an economy and how we work and manage our environmental impact.” Others said “we need to invest in UK capacity, skills and industry – we rely too much on China at present.” Some felt “we need to be more creative to make it [reaching net zero] possible even if it might be slower and more difficult.”  Areas mentioned less frequently Smaller numbers of assembly members made a number of additional points. → What we’ve learnt – some assembly members wondered “how to take into account what we’ve learnt during this time”, or said we “can’t forget about this, so how do we remember – risk of sliding back to [the] old normal and doubling down.” Others said “alternatives that have been used (during this period) have made an example for the future.” → How little effect the current situation has had on climate change – some assembly members said they were “surprised at how little effect the current situation has had on climate change, so shows scale of challenge – do still need to make some changes even if little impact.” Others said the “fact [there’s] only [been a] 10% drop in emissions since coronavirus shows how big a change we need to make – huge task.” Some reported being “a bit disheartened that the lockdown has not had such a big impact on climate change.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  510  → International context and the UK’s global role – some assembly members said that the “UK has a huge opportunity hosting COP267 after this crisis and that would be [the] time that the UK has to show leadership.” Others suggested “let’s build global co-operation, although worry politics of self-interest will resurface” or that “because it’s a worldwide thing – due to this circumstance – maybe everybody will be open to change e.g. being receptive to better ideas and international cooperation on air travel.” → Impacts on food supplies – some assembly members suggested that “food prices will go up and there will be incentives to grow more at home. The idea of not having ferries to Europe is worrying for food supplies.” Others agreed saying that “ferries are different [from other forms of transport] – they bring food. If they go bust food prices will go up.” Some said “there is a realisation of food security being an issue [and that there] will be long-term consequences. Example of Japan in 1992 – they didn’t import rice as they wanted to build food security – it drove up prices in [the] short-term – was seen as a matter of national security.” Others queried “would food prices not go down as supermarkets create offers?” → Views around specific policies – some assembly members questioned “is nuclear still a good idea? Too unsafe/risky” or said that “carbon capture also seems too risky.” Some said “we need incentives so businesses can move towards more energy efficient equipment.”  7  COP stands for Conference of the Parties. It is attended by countries that signed the 1994 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Recent COP meetings have focussed on the Paris agreement that was signed at COP21 in 2015. The Paris agreement aims to keep global warming to less than 2°C above pre-industrial revolution temperatures – and to pursue efforts to keep it below 1.5°C.  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  511  Concerns about discussing the implications of Covid-19 Three assembly members expressed concerns about discussing the implications of Covid-19 for reaching net zero: “We don’t know enough and the topic is too big. […] Our conversation isn’t evidence rich or grounded in science. We can’t understand the impact of the decisions we’re might make; we shouldn’t make decisions during a pandemic. To have the assembly make a statement is very difficult.” “No-one knows what is going to happen.” “After the pandemic isn’t a given, so using this group to plan doesn’t make sense. What are the parameters for this conversation? Timelines and so on. Are we assuming the pandemic is going to last 3 months, 6 months or longer? It is very difficult to make recommendations without this – given that the longer the pandemic lasts the more impact it will have on the economy and therefore the more emphasis would need to be placed on the economy.” One of these assembly members went on to say: “In my opinion the Citizens’ Assembly is in no position to pass any comment on the ‘implications’ of coronavirus on climate change when so little is known about the long term full scale of the impact, suffering and hardships that coronavirus will have on peoples’ lives. Failing to seek prior consensus from the Assembly as to whether the Assembly collectively wishes any statement to be made on its behalf linking net zero to coronavirus smacks of political hubris. At a time when lives are being lost and extraordinary sacrifices are being made at the height of a global pandemic is the Assembly seriously being asked to choose between deciding to fund the future NHS, social care, welfare and basic fabric of society vs net zero before the financial and social costs of the pandemic have even started to be felt? I refuse to be balloted on these rash, grossly naive and insensitive questions and I expect to see this response accurately conveyed to Parliament.” One of the three assembly members chose not to participate throughout the remainder of the discussions reported in this chapter.  Some assembly members noted ways in which the experience of Covid-19 and lockdown had not made them think or feel differently about how to get to net zero.  Ways in which thoughts and feelings hadn’t changed, and why General comments Some assembly members made general comments, noting for example that it “hasn’t really shifted [my] views”, or that we are “happy with the decisions we came up with.” Others noted that it “hasn’t changed the requirement to reach net zero … the goal is still the same” or that we “need to make changes, but [we] needed to make these anyway, e.g. travel.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  512  Reinforcing existing views Some assembly members said that the crisis had emphasised the importance of views they already held, or provided evidence for them. Comments included: “Emphasised that future plans should be focussed on emission lowering (with carbon capture as a last resort).” “It’s still a huge issue that needs to be faced. Lock down is enforcing the point that it is a global crisis – climate change hasn’t just stopped because of coronavirus.” “Always thought the government should lead the way and there’s a precedent now. People will do what they say if they believe it’s for the greater good.” “The fact that the coronavirus is now here has given us numbers to support the fact that we would like to have less vehicles on the road but I’ve always desired to have less vehicles on the road….” “These are the options we discussed [earlier in the assembly] – travelling less etc. Just had to have a crisis to push us to do it.” “The current situation emphasises and reinforces that any dramatic government actions taken to achieve net zero must be well planned, not undertaken in a panic or a rush.” Some assembly members gave specific examples of views that had stayed the same. These included that “we still need to insulate and heat our homes better” and “views on wind farms.” Several talked about their unchanged view that achieving net zero will be difficult. Some said that “hitting net zero was ambitious to start with”, or that “even though emissions have dropped, it is still not enough.” Others said that they “agree that things aren’t going to go back to how they were, but don’t feel any more positively about reaching net zero – question [of] if government will prioritise it, especially in a recession.” Some said that “politicians lack imagination – likely to go back to how things were” or that “climate deniers [are] still likely to ignore the evidence.” Some suggested that “public debt could be used as an excuse for inaction.” Others said their views hadn’t changed but that they had noted changes around them. For example, one assembly member commented that “you can see the change in the air and I like the wildlife coming out”. Another said my “view [has] not changed – [but we] have made good steps towards lifestyle change.” Conversely some assembly members said their views had remained the same because these changes won’t stick: “Don’t feel coronavirus will change things much – people will return to spending and the economy will bounce back.” “We are creatures of habit and [the] short term. Think many will go back to [the] same routine.” Some assembly members suggested it was too soon to consider whether the current situation had made them think or feel differently. Some said “it’s too soon to ask this question – ask again in six month’s time. There’s still so much which is uncertain. Depends on how it goes.” Others noted that “the economic impacts have yet to pan out” or that it’s “very early days, not sure what’s going to happen. Let’s wait and see.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  513  B.2.2 How we travel Assembly members who had examined ‘how we travel’ during weekends two and three of the assembly next moved on to discuss the impact of Covid-19 and lockdown on their thoughts and feelings about this topic in particular. 73% said that their thoughts and feelings about how to get to net zero in terms of ‘how we travel’ had changed.  Ways in which thoughts and feelings had changed, and why Impacts on air travel Some assembly members said that “there is definitely going to be a reduction in air travel over a decade”, that “people will be scared to travel by air”, or that “we don’t know what will happen. My instinct says that people will travel differently. There will be an enduring reluctance for people to travel on airlines.” Some said “people aren’t going to want to fly until there is a vaccine. This is good because there will be less emissions.” Others questioned “assuming this lasts for 18 months then is the airline industry going to recover? Budget market will disappear, because of the testing needed and people needing to be packed in. Even if the government says that it’s safe, will people want to do recreational travel?” Some predicted that “airlines will suffer and we will holiday less”, asking “will airlines hike prices and expect we will just travel less frequently?” Some commented that “the cost of air fares is certain to go up. The cutthroat market is gone. A lot of volatility in the flight prices”, or said a “lot of airlines are now in difficulty – are they going bust? There will be less airlines.” One assembly member said “my parents [are] looking to travel to Hong Kong for August – they are being told they have to have 2m distance so most seats will be empty. How will airlines make money from less people? It is still really risky. No one will want to travel too soon.” Some suggested that “there will be fewer planes but a bit resentful of that (when seeing planes for cargo) – but see there will be an impact on passenger confidence to fly.” One assembly member said “I am [now] more inclined to favour reduced travel by air….” Another commented: “I used to think that I needed to fly for holidays or to see family or for business, but I’ve now seen that we can make do with less flying. If we had of had the assembly meetings on air travel after the spread of coronavirus and the lockdown, I would have voted very differently for a solution that leads to less flying. Solutions I never would have imagined possible have now already happened. We don’t need to wait to transition to a world with less flights. It’s already here. Now we just need to invest in the alternatives.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  514  Homeworking Some assembly members felt that “Zoom may change the way people work”, or reported that they were “finding working from home is doable – and there are other benefits such as spending time with kids.” Others suggested there would be “less requirement for travel, Government should encourage home working even once a vaccine has been found.” One said that “for many job sectors we now know we don’t need to constantly move around to get work done, to go to meetings or even to catch up with friends.” Others commented: “Working from home is going to be more acceptable. I thought it wouldn’t work but I am doing it and it is working fine. [I had a] meeting with 8 people at work and 7 of the people on the meeting wanted to stay at home to work in the future.” “My company had a strong work from the office culture and weren’t prepared at the start of lockdown and people are surprised at how well it has worked.” “Before Covid-19 I used to travel a lot for work – IT supporting GPs for the NHS. Now I do it mostly from home.”  Broadband access Some assembly members said that “there is a lack of investment in broadband by the Government, they need to provide better infrastructure and broadband. People have to have the choice [to work from home].” Others questioned how much lack of broadband access is an issue or said they choose not to have it.  Impacts on public transport Some assembly members suggested that “we are going to struggle with public transport and more so with social distancing”, that “it will have a detrimental impact on public transport usage” or that “people will not want to use public transport as much; people will want to drive; bus companies will go bankrupt because they won’t be used as much.” Some noted that “its going to be difficult to encourage more public transport but social distancing on public transport is not going to be profitable.” Others said: “I’m scared to go on public transport. I feel a bit stuck – too far out of town to cycle. I love going on public transport but feel wary of it.” “I am also worried about going on a bus. You never know how clean something is. I’ll choose a car in future. You have to touch something on a bus. It took me longer to walk home. When will it be safe?” “The key question is when will we feel comfortable going on public transport. Even on pavements we have the ability to walk apart but you don’t have this feeling on the bus or train. People are going to opt for Uber or driving.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  515  Some suggested that “that feeling may well continue into the future – even when the virus is under control” or noted “same for trains. We never thought about it beforehand – but now we are sceptical.” Some felt there would be “less requirement to invest in public transport because of decreased use”, while others had the opposite view saying “they will have to put on more buses to allow for social distancing.” Some assembly members felt that impacts on public transport “will not be a permanent issue, once a vaccine has been found.” One assembly member commented that “people mentioned the issues with traveling on public transport in an epidemic, but we must think sensibly... This [Covid-19] will not be more of a threat than climate change seems to be.”  Walking and cycling Some assembly members said that “people won’t want to use public transport, so [the UK] will need to invest in electric cars and cycle and walking infrastructure.” Some commented that “the [government’s] 2 billion investment in cycling infrastructure will help” or suggested that “public spaces have now been adapted to encourage the public to change habits and consider walking/cycling more.” One assembly member said that “I can envisage a lot more people cycling. People seem to be happier taking bikes out and walking. [There is] [t]alk of new infrastructure to accommodate cycling.” Some expressed greater interest in electric bikes, with one assembly member commenting “I’d be more interested in [an] electric bike than sitting on a bus.” Some assembly members had a different view, suggesting that “measures such as widening public spaces are all well for good weather, but generally and more so in winter months [the] elderly / vulnerable are not going to use this, they’ll need to use their cars or public transport – which need to be readily available and operated in a carbon neutral way – otherwise we’ll be going back to existing ways and habits.”  Progress on electrification Continuing the above discussion, some assembly members expressed support for electric cars: “I still feel cars are a very important part of our future, especially in the short term, so electrification of cars will have to be massively subsidised for the next few years.” “I am more inclined to favour … the expansion of electrically powered road transport.” “I was a very strong advocate for public transport, but being in an enclosed space with lots of other people seems a very likely way of spreading the virus, so I am leaning more favourably towards electric cars than I was before.” “People are very unwilling to use public transport and air travel now so we need to focus on improving electric cars and completely getting rid of diesel and petrol cars and also improve cycling infrastructure.” Some assembly members commented “electric buses in city centres – why not do [it] now.” Some expressed an alternative view, saying “progress for electrification – electric car cost – maybe that won’t get pushed forwards now.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  516  Government ability to make change Some assembly members said it shows that “prioritising what happens [is] in the gift of government”, that “this pandemic has shown how Government CAN do something if it really wants to” or that “it has shown what we can do when forced to change … the government has leverage and we can achieve things for the greater good [especially] … when [we] work together.” Others had a different perspective saying “it’s not going to be as achievable, because of the impact on the economy. The Government will feel they can’t shift their focus. This worries me. We are already behind other countries.”  Scale of impact Some assembly members said “it is going to have a mega impact” or that “life will change a lot because of the virus.” One commented that “cleaner air and louder birdsong has had a profound effect on some of us.” Others felt that “this experience is going to change people’s psyche towards travel” or asked “how will people act if they continue to hear that people are dying?” Some assembly members disagreed saying “we’ll get over it once there is a vaccine.”  Speed of change One assembly member said that “we can change even quicker than I originally thought possible.” Another commented that “the opportunity to change and to see change quicker shouldn’t be wasted by going back to how things were before Covid-19.”  Other Other comments included: “How can governments make predictions to 2050 if they can’t even make predictions about next year?“ “Appetite for buying from China / long distances will be reduced and [there will be] a push for manufacturing in the UK – looking for how things can be made in a greener way.” “The shift to public transport, bus subsidies, car share schemes, should be abandoned.” “More people are going to be travelling by car.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  517  Ways in which thoughts and feelings hadn’t changed, and why Views that had stayed the same Some assembly members noted views that had stayed the same despite Covid-19 and the lock down: “Car/planes aren’t the problem – fuel is the problem. And there are solutions available for this and that need to be developed and mass produced – solutions are out there….” “Still think that we should not just look at [the] impact of passengers flying but also at cargo and find other ways to transport goods … and if prices go up for passengers [they] should also go up for cargo.” “Still want to travel as much as I can on aeroplanes even if I realise that may take a time to come.” “Due to Covid-19 [the] Government has been providing info every day to the public / organisations etc. Similarly [we] need a knowledge base for this [net zero] agenda that offers information / solutions on how to get to net zero that is shared and developed.”  Views not changed, but greater urgency Some assembly members said they “…just feel it’s more urgent to do it now – e.g. car charging points across the country – this is a massive job and will offer job creation.” Others commented that “there is an opportunity and urgency to this and to take the lessons from the experience around Covid-19 and apply it to approaches to get to net zero.”  Things will return to normal soon One assembly member said “I think it will return to normal soon.” Another commented: “Through both weekends, a huge preference of improving public transport was revealed. While some members of my group today raised concerns that they don’t feel confident about using public transport so soon and think the improvements should be pushed back and focused on [electric cars and] renewable energy production, I feel quite confident that society will return back to before coronavirus soon so I feel like I still agree with the push for improving the public transport infrastructure and electrifying it as well.” “We are seeing today that the Peak District car parks are full – car travel will stay the same and we are selfish and want to be in control.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  518  Additional comments One assembly member commented that “coronavirus has given us more time to think about things and appreciate what we can’t have right now like freedom.” Another commented: Using online conferencing (Zoom etc) increases the digital divide. […] Ease of use for most “ people, less travel (environmental costs reduced), save time (travel etc). But negative points are difficulties with global time differences, national holiday dates. [It also] [i]ncreases the gap with digital literacy and [the] economic divide (both between people, and countries).” Some assembly members looking at ‘in the home’, ‘what we buy’ and ‘what we eat and how we use the land’ also made comments about how we travel:   Choice of workplace – some assembly members predicted that “the workforce will be more trusted to work from home or work remotely. We need to think about remote working hubs too, so people can still have company but not travel so far. Some people find working from home hard, mentally.” Others commented that “people need more choices and options – more localised offices would be good. Plus the choice to work from home, and incentivise it.”    Some travel for work is still needed – some assembly members commented that “the virus and lockdown allows companies and the government to weigh up car use, working from home and evaluate what does and doesn’t make sense. 6–8 weeks is very different to the rest of your life. People can have mental health issues. Other industries could be wiped out e.g. office landlords. Building relationships by video conference is hard.“ Others agreed saying “we will still need to fly / meet people face to face, e.g. to build relationships for roles like sales.”    Less travel is good – one assembly member suggested that “spending more time in homes is better for CO2 – [I] will fly and drive less and use solar and wind power more.” Another reported that “seeing very few planes and having less road traffic has made for a more peaceful, healthy environment. You hear the birds better and the wildflowers are thriving.”    Tackle air travel – some assembly members said there is “more impetus to cut air travel now”, that it’s “more possible for businesses to use conference calls and to cut air travel”, or that we should “tackle [the] disproportionate number of people taking [the] majority of flights – more important to do this now.”    Travel on the land – some assembly members suggested that we are “going backwards and relying on cars, e.g. getting out of [the] village for shopping and to see somewhere new for [the benefit of our] mental health.” Others noted that “some people [are] still limited in travel options, e.g. from where they live. For example, they need public transport to get to work but can’t with social distancing.” Some commented that there is “more talk of promoting cycling now, but the problem is when [the] weather is bad – is cycling going to be feasible?”    Cost of oil – one assembly member commented that ”because oil has been so cheap recently, I know of many family / friends who have bought it in the last few weeks when they would not have done previously. I think an immediate change should be to increase the prices again (e.g. through taxation) to encourage more use of renewable resources and use the revenue from the tax to invest in renewables.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  519  B.2.3 In the home Assembly members who had examined heat and energy use in the home during weekends two and three of the assembly discussed the impact of Covid-19 and lockdown on their thoughts and feelings about the path to net zero for this topic. As reported in Section B.1 above, 35% said that their thoughts and feelings had changed; 39% said they hadn’t and 26% didn’t know or were unsure.  Ways in which thoughts and feelings had changed, and why Greater awareness Some assembly members suggested that the more people are at home, “the more people might feel the incentive to change electricity supply e.g. solar panels, or fitting insulation.” Others agreed, saying “if you’re in the home permanently [you] would be more aware of what energy you’re using in the home” or that you “would think a lot more about it.” Some said that “insulation and retrofitting is more in focus, as people have worked from home now and will see the usefulness of it more. For new build homes too.” One assembly member commented that “spending more time in the home has made me think about how much energy I need to use due to poor insulation. With more people at home remote working it is important to make sure that we have innovative ways to reduce emissions and I’m now more interested in heat pumps as they are less disruptive in this time.”  Implications around energy use and costs Some assembly members said we are “using more electricity than [we] normally do”, that “if we stay at home our homes are using more electricity especially if you have kids at home all the time”, or that we are “using more energy in the home – spending more too.” Some noted “concern that more power is being used in the home and the impact that may have on bills – this may need more government intervention to address fuel poverty.” Individual assembly members commented: “My own home is dark and cold. Before my husband started working from home, we didn’t put the heating on during the day. Now he’s here, we do. His office [i.e. where he works usually] is heated. This has put our costs up. What about an allowance from work to heat our home, or to make it more energy efficient?” “The experience of lockdown has resulted in a lot more people being at home and working from home. If this trend is to be long-term then having a plan in place to re-fit old homes that aren’t energy efficient will be more crucial than ever.” “From [a] purely personal point of view, I should not have put off the home insulation project. The last few weeks at home all day would have been warmer and cheaper! – and less CO2 emitted from here. Delay costs money and the environment.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  520  “We are all using more energy in our homes during this crisis, and we are fast approaching summer. I am concerned that if this had been during the winter months, the effects on people’s lives would’ve been much worse. With this in mind, it has highlighted the need for cheap reliable energy, and I do not want to see people’s bills rise in order to pay for green initiatives. We already pay more to fund these green initiatives and I feel the subsidies should be removed.”  Views on government action Some assembly members said that changes “will be driven by industry and government – makes change more likely” or that “it hasn’t changed my views on how to do it but it has demonstrated that it can be more ‘doable’ than I feared.” Some assembly members said that they now “feel this should be more of a common endeavour, not just the government doing stuff.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  521  Financial and economic implications Some assembly members said that “a lot has gone back to the drawing board, a lot of people have been financially very adversely affected” or that it will be “less feasible for home owners to upgrade homes – for next decade possibly – government action is essential.” Others said that “people [are now] focused on keeping businesses going and getting debt paid off” or that there is “less money available to improve homes to become more energy efficient. Virus may delay reaching net zero. Worried government may not allocate sufficient funds to support this.” Some assembly members disagreed, commenting that “we have the wealth (using a global comparison) to do this despite current difficulties – and we should.”  Changes to views on specific policies or technologies Some assembly members said we should “maybe look more at home energy efficiency, e.g. [gas boiler] scrappage scheme – but more energy use in [the] home would be balanced by less office space.” Others said they “wonder whether heat networks might be a less reliable source of power if lockdown conditions stay as there will be less industrial activity able to feed them.”  Feel more strongly One assembly member commented that it “made me more convinced of what needs doing.” Another said “I feel even more strongly that we must make every effort we can to reduce emissions within the home and all the ways of doing this that we discussed and agreed on are even more important.”  Shock Some assembly members said that they were “shocked by the lack of impact [of lockdown] on climate change” or commented that “everyone has been shocked by what’s happened with coronavirus.”  Having work done while at home Some assembly members said that “people won’t want workmen in [their] home.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  522  Ways in which thoughts and feelings hadn’t changed, and why No or very little change Some assembly members said that Covid-19 and lockdown had made “no difference” to their views, or said that “not much has changed for me.” One assembly member wrote that “I cannot see much changing in how we use energy in our homes except the high fixed costs of many methods may be more difficult for individuals to cover as disposable incomes fall during the recession. This would be another area where higher levels of government expenditure may be required to reach the net zero target. It will be interesting to see if this changes if some level of lockdown lasts over the winter months.” Other individuals noted that “the ‘in the home’ topic was never really controversial so the solutions we came up with are relatively unchanged”, or that “I still think the changes should be made and paid for and incentivised by government led initiatives.”  Specific views unchanged Some assembly members noted specific views that had stayed the same despite Covid-19 and lockdown. Some said that “homeowners were never going to pick up the bill – scale is massive, needs central funding” or that “government should be incentivising people to improve their homes with grants etc.” Others re-emphasised the “benefits of solar panels” or said that “the building that has started again – needs to be energy efficient.” Others commented that their “views in favour of hydrogen, regional heating systems etc haven’t changed – just more urgency.”  Haven’t felt impact yet Some assembly members said “it’s been warm so I haven’t had to put the heating on” or “we’re now in summer, so no hardship being locked down. What will happen come winter, when household bills go up? Highlights the need for cheap energy.”  Views haven’t changed, but we have noticed changes Some assembly members said they had noticed “more deliveries, increased use of [the] internet” or that “we are using more electricity.” One assembly member commented: “Think the impacts have been more to do with travel and air travel”  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  523  B.2.4 ‘What we eat and how we use the land’ & ‘What we buy’ Assembly members who had examined ‘what we eat and how we use the land’ and ‘what we buy’ during weekends two and three of the assembly discussed the impact of Covid-19 and lockdown on their thoughts and feelings about these topics. As reported in Section B.1 above, 36% said that their thoughts and feelings had changed; 26% said they hadn’t; 37% said they didn’t know or were unsure.  Ways in which thoughts and feelings had changed, and why Food security Some assembly members said that “the UK is not a food secure country. 53% of our food is produced in the UK, 47% comes from elsewhere – imported, mainly from the EU.” Some commented that “as countries come out of lockdown in different ways, importing food may be less doable – might grow more of our own.” Others felt that the current situation “prompts [the] UK to be more independent with food – it’s not sustainable to import to that extent – not just food, what else can we make here? Raises the question more pressingly that was already raised by net zero.” Some queried “are we importing less food currently?” or said Covid-19 and lockdown “made [them] feel more strongly that we shouldn’t be relying on imports.”  Economic implications Some assembly members expressed “concern that people are more worried about money at the moment.” One commented, “I feel sorry for self-employed couples. Use their savings to get by. Wonder what the financial impacts of Covid-19 will be for many people?” Some assembly members predicted that “less disposable income will probably affect what people buy – maybe higher quality too – changing consumeristic attitudes.” Some speculated that “meat use might reduce because it’s more expensive.” Some suggested that “having limited choices during the lockdown is a good example of what we could face with climate change. Good to see that we have been wasting less. We have planned the meals more. Saved money.”  Buying locally and local produce Some assembly members reported that they “have started buying more locally, trying to get things not imported. Altered shopping habits. Enjoyed doing it because [we] felt [we were] supporting local businesses.” Other said they had “noticed people are using local produce more, even if it might be a bit more expensive (especially if they deliver). Used to be lots of people going to [the] supermarket. But because of queues etc, that’s lessened and more uptake in local buying.” Some assembly members disagreed saying the “uptake in local buying isn’t the same everywhere – some places still shop at the supermarket because it’s the cheapest.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  524  Behaviour change One assembly member commented that “consumer behaviours that I wouldn’t have expected before I now believe are much more likely to happen (e.g. reusing products) so this effects the incentives required to change people’s behaviours.” Others noted that “people are sharing more – giving stuff to each other, or reduced rates for key workers, doing each others’ shopping – will that attitude continue? Could help with emissions – stronger community spirit.”  Change will be easier and is more important One assembly member said “I think it’ll be easier as long as we keep the momentum and use what we are learning now from this going forward.” Another commented that “if anything they [the recommendations] are more important now than ever and would be even easier accepted. Very very important [that] diary farmers … get a fair price for milk …. They were being squeezed by the big 4 supermarkets. They deserve a fair price for their products.” Other individuals suggested that “just introducing change may be easier as change is already happening” or that “this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to asses what we eat, what we actually need and food supply chain processes. Also transport options can be addressed for future environment targets.”  Other comments Other comments included: “People feel closer to nature – more appreciative of our land. We’ve started looking round and found what matters. Rewilding and respecting nature has gone up in priority.” “Getting people back to work and kick-starting a failing economy must be a priority.”  Ways in which thoughts and feelings hadn’t changed, and why Our recommendations still stand Some assembly members recorded a “consensus amongst the group that all the points made by assembly members [about food, farming and land use] are still relevant. How do you use the land better? How to use more renewable energy? The whole subject is common sense.” Others said they “stand by the principles [previously agreed]: change is still needed” or that “everything that was decided in the Assembly is important. We know it is still important. Covid-19 has made it even more important.” Some groups reported that it is “not clear that views have changed in any substantial way.“  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  525  Our views haven’t changed, but we have noticed changes Some assembly members said differences between pre- and post-lockdown were “more about how things have changed rather than [that] views have changed.” Some said that “food costs have gone up (oranges)”, that “getting Polish food has become more difficult – miss it”, or that “in general consumption patterns haven’t changed – just things like not getting a coffee when you’re out going for a walk.” Some assembly members commented that “we’ve made big advances towards things that are positive for reaching net zero, and we should keep these things: buying locally and supporting local businesses, buying from local shops.” One assembly member commented: “It hasn’t made me feel differently. However there have been changes to how people shop – many are shopping more locally, or growing their own – and to how people see land use, appreciating nature and seeing the benefits of re-wilding (when you leave nature alone how it flourishes). This is something we can build on.” One assembly member noted the complexity of the situation: “The effects of lockdown differ so much from person to person it is impossible to say. I don’t know enough about how lockdown has affected farmers. I don’t know if it has affected land use at all so I don’t feel I can comment on this.”  Conclusions – impact on the assembly’s thinking Assembly members tended to agree that Covid-19 and the lockdown had made them think or feel differently about the how the UK should get to net zero in general. 62% ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that this was the case; 28% ‘strongly disagreed’ or ‘disagreed’. Assembly members who reported changed thoughts and feelings talked about areas including:   There being an opportunity for change, including increased willingness to accept it from the general population;    Altered perceptions of what is possible, including what government can do;    Lifestyle change that is already happening – for example, homeworking is proving more doable than some thought; changes to how we travel are taking place;    Economic impacts that, for example, make reaching net zero more difficult.  The impact of Covid-19 and the lockdown on assembly members’ thoughts and feelings about topics they had considered before it happened varied.  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  526  The biggest impact was on views about ‘how we travel’: 75% of the assembly members who looked at this topic said that Covid-19 and lockdown had changed their thoughts and feelings about how to get to net zero in this area. Key themes in their discussions included:   Changes happening to air travel, with some assembly members suggesting that people may continue to fly less;    Homeworking becoming more acceptable;    The impact on public transport, with some assembly members noting that people are currently less willing to use it and raising questions about whether or not that would last long-term;    Increases in cycling and walking, although some expressed doubts about whether these would hold during the winter.  A minority of assembly members said their thoughts and feelings had changed about the other topics the assembly had considered prior to the pandemic: ‘in the home’ (35%), and ‘what we eat and how we use the land’ and ‘what we buy’ (36%). Assembly members who reported changed thoughts or feelings about heat and energy use ‘in the home’ had changed suggested that the pandemic may make change more likely: people are more aware of their energy use if they are at home more. They also noted the increased energy costs of being at home and suggested a need to address them. They put forward ideas ranging from an allowance from work, to cheap energy, to getting old homes retrofitted. Assembly members who said their thoughts or feelings on ‘what we eat and how we use the land’ or ‘what we buy’ noted points including a feeling the UK should be less reliant on imports for its food. They also highlighted shifts in some areas to buying more local produce or from local businesses. Some assembly members suggested that changes to what we buy may now be easier, for example because of reduced incomes or an increased in community spirit. Assembly members whose views had not changed suggested, among other comments, that the pandemic had provided evidence for views they already held, or underlined their importance. A minority of assembly members noted that they now saw reaching net zero as less of a priority than economic recovery. Across all the votes, assembly members tended to avoid expressing ‘strong’ views – i.e. they chose ‘agree’ or ‘disagree’ rather than ‘strongly agree’ or ‘strongly disagree’. This may reflect the uncertainties and emerging nature of the current situation. In general, their comments reflected the changed context created by Covid-19 rather rather requests for alterations to specific recommendations made earlier in the assembly. Some assembly members raised new issues, such as a the request to help people with the increased energy costs of being at home.  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  527  C. Anything else to add Assembly members’ ballot papers included the opportunity to add any final thoughts on Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero. Many chose to leave comments. We have grouped them under ten overlapping headings, for ease of navigation.  What’s important in life  “ It may [be a] … chance for people to take stock of the important things in life.” It was nice to be able to go for a walk and cross a normally very busy road without “ seeing a single car. It was good to see how many people started cycling too. My daughter is working from home and doesn’t miss the commute to work, has saved money on petrol and has enjoyed spending time with her little boy. Perhaps there are bigger priorities for people’s well-being than the state of the economy, and working from home will become the ‘new normal’.” [and] lockdown have made us value a more simple way of living, working “ Coronavirus from home, being with family.” feel many people will make changes in their own lives – some will, some won’t. “ II feel [the] majority will though, and buy local, work less days a week. More will work from home reducing emissions etc.”  Perceptions of what is possible Hopefully [it] made us look around and see clearer skies, less traffic. Made people “ see it is possible.” has now shown us what is possible if people rally together and listen to science “ Coronavirus to save lives. We need to take this approach and move forward as we rebuild the economy.” lockdown is abnormal hence might not necessarily be a yardstick for climate “ The change net zero aspirations. However, the present situation does prove that given [the] right incentives, humans can adapt.” Covid-19 crisis has brought home the realisation that we can’t rely on quick technological “ The fixes for every emergency. We need to start our work to address climate change now.”  Information and communication Information and education are key for both how people have responded to the virus “ and how they should engage on the subject of climate change and the net zero target.” It has shown that people can work together when they feel threatened, but also that if people “ are not fully aware or fully informed of the impending problem they will ignore it.” Use observations of environmental changes seen during this time to show people “ what happened after such a short time of these restrictions.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  528  An opportunity for change is an opportunity to incorporate net zero into the new reality that will become “ This tomorrow’s new normal.” is a once in a lifetime opportunity for government to deliver environmental “ This targets as part of our economy recovery.” I think the lockdown has heightened people’s awareness of climate change and what “ can be achieved. Strike while the iron’s hot.” It will be a grave mistake and missed opportunity if we simply try to helter-skelter “ back to our previous values and lifestyles.” the government: don’t miss this chance to help us change the way we live now “ To and for future generations.”  Is meeting the net zero target possible or desirable now? I don’t think that this is now going to be achieved due to the other issues that have “ been thrust upon us!” that the economic impact may now take the focus off the target, as other “ Concern priorities may be more to the front.” It’s going to be one hell of an effort to get there since companies and governments “ need to invest in projects/industries etc that will help achieve the goal of net zero.” I think it has shown that on a personal level, and for our country as a whole, the priority “ has to be our economic well-being, and that green initiatives are a nice to have, when and if we can afford them.”  The relative threat from climate change though Covid-19 is a priority, the climate emergency is even more urgent. Covid-19, “ ifEven not contained would rip through our societies and millions would die. As with all pandemics some would survive and the human race would carry on. If we allow the planet to continue heating up to an extent where no intervention from us would stop it, we wouldn’t have a world to live on and neither would the diversity of life we depend on.” the climate emergency is a bigger threat than coronavirus to the UK, the rest “ ofI believe the world and human beings in general. Covid-19 has been the biggest short-term threat we have faced in recent times, but the climate emergency is the biggest long term threat we will ever face. We need to continue with our target to achieve net zero and be the generation that’ll be remembered that did everything we could to save our planet and recovered our economy from the coronavirus crisis through investing in carbon zero investments and technologies.” More lives have been saved by reductions in air pollution already than have been “ lost to Covid-19. This shows the sheer scale of the crisis facing us with climate change. People are dying, forests are burning, towns and cities are flooding and island nations are disappearing below the waves. Now is the time to take action. Lives depend on us.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  529  Transparency, leadership and the global context should not shy away from net zero in the wake of the virus. It should be “ Government bold and lead the discussion and efforts to get the public and companies on board.” is an historic opportunity for the UK to show global leadership, re-establish its “ COP26 place in the world, and help build a global consensus for moving the world towards net zero as it moves out of this crisis.” country has escaped Covid-19 and some are now working together to find answers and “ Aswaysnoforward, perhaps it will be easier for global decisions to be made on climate issues.”  “ We need good leadership. Urgently.” I think it is likely that the population will come out of this situation with a lower “ level of trust for the current government. Therefore, I think transparency in how they are reaching net zero, which industries they are investing in and where public money is being spent is vital in how we reach the net zero by 2050 target.”  A green economic recovery like the idea of … companies [having] to reach certain net zero targets “ toI really benefit from government investment with high levels of enforcement.” I think the most important thing for the government to do is think of ways to pair “ reaching net zero and recovering the economy. There are so many ways this can be done – e.g. bailing out companies but only if they agree to invest a [percentage of their] … profits into a low carbon technology.” should not just bailout companies, there should be a net zero portion “ Government to any monies spent ….” With all the job losses after lockdown the government will need to retrain “ people with new skills. Why not achieve net zero with a green revolution.”  Incentives for individuals and a basic income is a concern that household investments in electric cars, heat pumps and double “ There glazing will be delayed because of the squeeze on household incomes. The government needs to think of ways to incentivise purchases which support industry and allow individuals to move their habits to lower carbon [ones], as people will be putting off these big purchases for a while to come otherwise.” I don’t think you should be bailing out companies; I think you should be bailing out “ the people. Money is power! So if you give the money to the people, you’ll be allowing the people to use their money to spend on the companies that are doing things right. People will be able to buy what they think is right rather than what they can afford. The last thing we need now is another recession, along with people being forced to spend money that they haven’t got on making changes they don’t understand. Educate the people to create a cleaner world and give them the funds to choose how they want to do this. [….] I believe now is the time to create a basic minimum income. Wealth creates wealth. Isn’t it time for us to live in times of abundance, where things are done for the benefit of all, including the earth, the environment and the climate.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  530  Additional comments on topics considered by the assembly How we travel I feel air travel no longer seems such a potent problem, especially for now, so we “ should probably focus our energies on cleaner power and cars and reduce movement a bit; then we will have a shot at reaching our target.” we do not go back to using our cars as much as before, or go back to flying “ asI hope much as before. Just a reduction in both would help.” pandemic has changed how the decisions we made will work and this needs “ The to be taken into account especially with the issue of how we need to not focus on public transport anymore.”  What we eat and what we buy I think it has highlighted how dependent we are on imports, especially in the food “ industry. If we can produce more locally it would certainly be beneficial for the economy as well as reducing carbon emissions from importing goods from abroad.” I think there has been a massive impact on what we consume when there is no “ opportunity to go shopping (not including food shopping) which will have a further impact on how we live after lockdown, especially if disposable incomes fall. I think this is a chance to encourage people to move away from a disposable, fast-paced consumption to more reusable and repairable goods.” One assembly commented that “I see a lot of positives but many will be in financial difficulties – [the] self-employed, small businesses etc.”  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  531  Conclusions Assembly members’ views on Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero are significant. No other group is at once a representative sample of the UK population and well-acquainted with the steps needed to reach net zero. A clear view emerged from assembly members’ discussions that the current “tough and sad time” presents an opportunity for change that should be taken. A large majority of assembly members (79%) ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that, ‘steps taken by the government to help the economy recover should be designed to help achieve net zero’. Their most frequently given reasons included requests for the Government to:   Limit, or put conditions on, investment in high carbon industries;8    Rethink and invest in infrastructure;    Support low carbon industries;    Make the most of the economic opportunities presented by the path to net zero;    Deal with Covid-19 and climate change together where possible.  Assembly members who were unsure or who disagreed with the statement tended to emphasise a need to focus on economic recovery first and foremost. Another large majority (93%) of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ that, ‘as lockdown eases, government, employers and/or others should take steps to encourage lifestyles to change to be more compatible with reaching net zero’. Assembly members backed steps to encourage homeworking and changes to how we travel. They also saw a key role for government in providing leadership and information, alongside roles for business and local areas. In contrast to the above assembly members tended to avoid expressing ‘strong’9 views about whether Covid-19 and lockdown had made them think or feel differently about the how the UK should get to net zero. Overall they tended to agree that they now thought or felt differently about how the UK should get to net zero in general (62%). They re-emphasised the idea of there being an opportunity for change, whilst also reporting altered perceptions of what is possible (e.g. what government can do) and pointing to lifestyle changes that are already happening. Some highlighted the economic impacts of the pandemic, suggesting, for example, that they make reaching net zero more difficult.  8 9  This was both the most frequently given rationale and the most controversial, with some assembly members disagreeing. Please see pages 488 and 489. They tended to choose ‘agree’ or ‘disagree’ in all four relevant votes, rather than ‘strongly agree’ or ‘strongly disagree’.  Climate Assembly UK ― Covid-19, recovery and the path to net zero  532  In terms of topics that the assembly had considered prior to the pandemic, the biggest impact was on views about ‘how we travel’: 73% of the assembly members who looked at this topic said that Covid-19 and lockdown had changed their thoughts and feelings about how to get to net zero in this area. Key themes in their discussions included:   Changes happening to air travel, with some assembly members suggesting that people may continue to fly less;    Homeworking becoming more acceptable;    The impact on public transport, with some assembly members noting that people are currently less willing to use it and raising questions about whether or not that would last long-term;    Increases in cycling and walking, although some expressed doubts about whether these would hold during the winter.  A minority of assembly members said their thoughts and feelings had changed about the other topics the assembly had considered prior to the pandemic: ‘in the home’ (35%), and ‘what we eat and how we use the land’ and ‘what we buy (36%)’. Assembly members whose thoughts and feelings had not changed suggested, among other comments, that the pandemic had provided evidence for views they already held, or underlined their importance. A minority noted that they now saw reaching net zero as less of a priority than economic recovery. In general, assembly members comments reflected the changed context created by Covid-19 rather rather requests for alterations to specific recommendations made earlier in the assembly. Some assembly members raised new issues, such as a a request to help people with the increased energy costs of being at home.

Assembly members worked together to draft suggested additions. The proposals were then put to a vote of the whole assembly. 2 In total, assembly members voted in favour of thirty-nine additional recommendations. They did not pass two further proposals. The recommendations touch on themes including: transparency, accountability and decision-making; education, communication and engagement; international action and impacts; and incentives, payments, conditions, and taxes. 3 For the full list and wording of each recommendation – some are detailed – please keep reading this chapter. The ten additional recommendations that received most support were:   1  The transition to net zero should be a cross-political party issue, and not a partisan one (96% support)1    More transparency in the relationship between big energy companies and government (94% support)    Get to net zero without pushing our emissions to elsewhere in the world (92% support)    Incentives to accelerate progress to net zero and conditions attached for organisations seeking government financial support (91% support)    A robust media strategy on the outcomes of the assembly (90% support)    An independent neutral body that monitors and ensures progress to net zero, including citizens assemblies and independent experts (89% support)    Move away from fossil fuels and transition to new energy sources (89% support)    Products and services labelled to include their carbon footprint (89% support)    A follow up on the outcomes of the assembly covering what has been taken into account, what hasn’t and why (88% support)    Harness the response to Covid-19 and COP26 to drive international co-ordinated action on climate change (87% support)  Proposals not passed by the assembly The assembly did not pass two proposals. Both focussed on reaching net zero by an earlier date than 2050. Slightly more assembly members opposed such a move than supported it, with the balance held by those who were ‘unsure’ or ‘didn’t mind’.  % of assembly members who ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ with the recommendation.  Climate Assembly UK ― Additional recommendations  535  Additional recommendations On the final assembly weekend, all assembly members discussed whether or not they wanted to add any further recommendations to this report.  What did the assembly choose to consider? Assembly members could suggest recommendations on any aspect of the path to net zero. They started by thinking, as individuals, about the following question:2 “Is there anything else you would like to tell government and Parliament about how the UK should get to net zero?” They then discussed emerging proposals in small groups, with each group able to put forward a maximum of three ideas. The facilitation team turned these ideas into a ballot paper, using assembly members’ own wording.3 There were forty-one suggestions for additional recommendations in total. Assembly members then voted by secret ballot. Assembly members did not hear any new evidence to inform their votes. Their decisions were based on their own experiences, values, views and knowledge, and the information they had heard throughout the assembly. We made clear to assembly members that they did not have to vote on all the proposals if they did not want to, or that they could choose ‘unsure’ if they did not feel they had sufficient information to express a view.  2  3  The facilitators had encouraged assembly members to think about this question at previous assembly weekends and to note down thoughts. We kept a list of their suggestions and presented them back to the assembly at this point so that assembly members could pick the ideas up in their discussions if they wanted to. The only exception is where facilitators combined ideas that were so similar as to be almost identical. Here they retained as much of the original wording as possible, only making small changes as necessary to accommodate variations in language or nuance.  Climate Assembly UK ― Additional recommendations  536  Vote results In total, a majority of assembly members backed thirty-nine additional recommendations. They rejected two. The results for all the recommendations are included below. We have categorised them under the following headings to make them easier to navigate:   Transparency, accountability and decision-making;    Education, communication and engagement;    Covid-19;    Generations and equality;    International action and impacts;    The net zero target date;    What we buy;    Incentives, payments, conditions, and taxes;    Other specific policy areas;    Miscellaneous.  We used the same headings to organise the proposals on assembly members’ ballot papers.  Transparency, accountability and decision-making A majority of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ with all the suggested recommendations in this category:   Levels of ‘strong agreement’ were generally high: A majority of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ with nine of the eleven suggested recommendations. Over 70% ‘strongly agreed’ with four of them (please see below);    Levels of ‘strong disagreement’ and ‘disagreement’ were low. No assembly members ‘strongly disagreed’ or ‘disagreed’ with two recommendations – making the transition to net zero a cross-party issue and greater transparency about the relationship between government and big energy companies;    A proposal for citizens’ assemblies on issues relating to net zero not covered by Climate Assembly UK, potentially including the net zero target date, was the least popular option in this category, with a high number of assembly members (28%) saying they ‘didn’t mind’ or were ‘unsure.’  Climate Assembly UK ― Additional recommendations  537  The full wording of each recommendation was as follows. Recommendations are listed in order of popularity:4  4    “We want the transition to net zero to be a cross-political party issue, and not a partisan issue” (96% support)    “We need much more transparency in the relationship between big energy companies and the government, due to concerns over lobbying and influence” (94% support)    “There should be an independent neutral body that is not political and lasts beyond political cycles that monitors and ensures progress to net zero – including citizens’ assemblies (as a neutral and fair option) and independent experts – to guarantee continued progress and policy development” (89% support)    “A follow up on the outcomes of Climate Assembly UK is needed to ensure we know: 1- how Parliament and government have taken the assembly’s recommendations on board, 2- what has been taken into account, what hasn’t and why. This follow up could be done face-to-face or online, funding should be allocated for doing it, and citizens from Climate Assembly UK should be able to directly ask questions to Parliament or government” (88% support)    “There should be a dedicated department for achieving net zero which holds regular briefings with clear milestones that hold the government to account” (86% support)    “The government should publish the carbon budgets (i.e. the 5 yearly plans showing where the UK should be on its path to net zero) and progress towards them on a quarterly basis” (86% support)    “Government should be better held to account for their action on net zero by an ongoing relationship with citizens through mechanisms like regular citizens’ assemblies” (82% support)    “There should be regular (at least annual) independent reviews, citizens’ assemblies and scrutiny by the six parliamentary committees to ensure progress is being made by government to reach net zero” (81% support)    “The Government should commission a citizens’ assembly, or an independent citizens’ forum / citizens body, to provide oversight on meeting the net zero target. This could take the form of: —  On-going citizens’ assemblies to ensure that all political parties and all governments are committed to implementing Climate Assembly UK’s recommendations; monitor the progress of the implementation of these recommendations; ensure that future assemblies can review what the government does for achieving net zero, based on new evidence (science and technology) coming in, and/or  —  Regular non-partisan committees of the public, based on the same demographic as Climate Assembly UK, to review progress to hold the government to account against a visible time-line” (80% support)  % of assembly members who ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ with the recommendation.  Climate Assembly UK ― Additional recommendations  538  Above: Chris Stark (Committee on Climate Change) and Tony Juniper (Natural England) take questions from assembly members.    “There should be a Minister with exclusive responsibility and accountability for ensuring net zero targets are met and government departments are co-ordinated in their efforts and achievements to meet their targets” (78% support)    “We need another climate assembly or citizens’ assemblies on issues relating to net zero that have not been discussed, to involve citizens and business. This could include looking at whether the 2050 target is too late” (59% support)  Climate Assembly UK ― Additional recommendations  539  Strongly disagree Disagree  Figure 1: Transparency, accountability and decision-making  Don’t mind/unsure  Please tell us how much you agree or disagree with each of the following (%)  Agree Strongly agree  % 0 Cross-party approach  20  40  60  75%  80  100  21% 4%  Transparency in the relationship between big energy companies and government  74%  Dedicated government department for net zero  73%  20% 5% 13%  7% 4% 2%  Government Minister with responsibility and accountability for net zero  51%  Government to publish carbon budgets  57%  27%  14%  7% 1%  29%  10% 3% 1%  Face-to-face or online follow-up about assembly outcomes  72%  16%  9% 1% 1%  Government held to account on net zero through an on-going relationship with citizens  54%  Citizens’ assembly oversight on net zero target progress  51%  28%  13% 4% 1%  29%  10% 7% 3%  Citizens’ assembly on net zero issues not covered by this assembly  37%  At least annual independent reviews of progress towards net zero  47%  Independent neutral body to monitor net zero progress  59%  22%  28%  11% 2%  34%  13% 4% 2% 30%  8% 2% 1%  Climate Assembly UK ― Additional recommendations  540  Education, communication and engagement Figure 2: Education, communication and engagement  Please tell us how much you agree or disagree with each of the following (%) % 100  4% 6% 10%  2% 8%  3% 1% 10%  5% 2% 18%  32% 31%  45%  50  49%  37%  58% 41%  38%  0 Climate change compulsory subject in school Strongly disagree  Disagree  Robust media strategy for assembly outcomes Don’t mind/unsure  Communication and engagement plan for the public Agree  Information portal and live CO 2 tracker  Strongly agree  At least 75% of assembly members ‘strongly agreed’ or ‘agreed’ with all the recommendations in this category.

Levels of ‘strong disagreement’ or ‘disagreement’ with these proposals were low, never rising above 10% in total. Fewer assembly members (58% and 53%, respectively) supported the other two suggested recommendations, around synthetic fuels and carbon offsetting. Levels of opposition were however low (11% for synthetic fuels) or moderate (18% for carbon offsetting). High numbers of assembly members said they were ‘unsure’ or ‘didn’t mind’ (31% and 30%, respectively) about these proposals. The full wording of each recommendation was as follows.

Relatively high numbers of assembly members (21% and 22%) said they ‘didn’t mind’ or were ‘unsure’ about both proposals. The full wording of each recommendation was as follows. They are listed in order of popularity:   “There should be a major national competition/challenge/prize for the best invention or initiative to address net zero and that the winners are implemented” (70% support)    “We should enable individuals, influencers and charities to contribute to getting to net zero by raising funds through an event – ‘climate relief’, similar to comic relief but with a climate change focus” (57% support)  Climate Assembly UK ― Additional recommendations  550  Conclusions Assembly members made thirty-nine additional recommendations in total. Many received high levels of backing: at least 80% of assembly members supported twenty-five of the recommendations; at least two-thirds supported thirty-four of them. The recommendations covered a broad range of areas, and included statements at the level of aims as well as more specific policy proposals:   Some recommendations picked up or fleshed out themes present since the assembly’s very first decision on underpinning principles for the path to net zero – for example, the recommendations around information and education, government leadership and the need for a cross-party approach;    Some recommendations re-emphasised decisions that had already been made – for example, on labelling for products and services;    Others raised new points – for example, around water use, and financial services – or allowed assembly members to vote formally on issues that had come up in discussion at earlier weekends.  The assembly did not support two proposals, both around reaching net zero earlier than 2050. Slightly more assembly members opposed such a move than supported it, with the balance held by those who were ‘unsure’ or ‘didn’t mind.’ The assembly members’ agreement of their additional recommendations brought the assembly process to its close. It marked the completion of Climate Assembly UK’s recommended path to net zero.

At present, there is no coordinated plan with clear milestones towards achieving the target, making it difficult for Parliament and the general public to understand or scrutinise how the country is doing in its efforts to achieve net zero emissions. Government intends to publish a plethora of strategies this year setting out how it will reduce emissions in different sectors ranging from transport to the heating of buildings culminating in an overall net zero strategy. Departments are not yet sufficiently considering the impact on net zero when taking forward projects and programmes. The Treasury has changed its guidance for policy appraisal to ensure departments place greater emphasis on the environmental impacts but has not set out how this will work in practice. Government is not yet ensuring its activities to reduce UK emissions are not simply transferring emissions overseas, which would undermine global efforts to tackle climate change. As much as 62% of the future reduction in emissions will rely on individual choices and behaviours, from day to day lifestyle choices to one off purchases such as replacing boilers that use fossil fuels or buying an electric vehicle. Government has not yet properly engaged with the public on the substantial behaviour changes that achieving net zero will require. Local authorities will also play a major role in the move to net zero, and Government will need to engage more with local authorities about how they can contribute, including ensuring they will have the necessary resources.  3  4  Achieving Net Zero  Introduction In June 2019, government committed in law to achieving ‘net zero’ greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, requiring the UK’s emissions in 2050 to be equal to or less than what is removed from the atmosphere by either the natural environment or carbon capture technologies. This target aims to deliver on the commitments it had made by signing the Paris Agreement in 2016. Net zero is an increase in ambition from the government’s previous target, set in 2008, to reduce net emissions by 80% by 2050 compared with 1990 levels. Reducing emissions further to achieve net zero is a colossal challenge, requiring wide-ranging changes to the UK economy and to the way we all live our lives. This includes further investment in renewable electricity generation, as well as changing the way people travel, how land is used and how buildings are heated. The all-encompassing nature of achieving net zero means that organisations across central and local government, as well as the public, all have a role to play. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (the Department) has overall responsibility for achieving net zero. It also has lead responsibility for decarbonising many of the highest-emitting sectors of the economy, such as power and industry. The Department must work with the Devolved Administrations and other departments, such as the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs and the Department for Transport, which each hold responsibility for decarbonisation in their respective policy areas. Progress has not been uniform and whilst emissions from power have declined by 62% between 2008–2018, surface transport emissions have declined by only 3% over the same time period. HM Treasury has a key role to play given it allocates budgets to government departments and is central to assessing the relative priority of policies across government and in ensuring departments have the funding needed for programmes to reduce emissions.  Achieving Net Zero  5  Conclusions and recommendations 1.  Government has not set out how it plans to achieve net zero despite having set the target in 2019. In June 2019, Parliament legislated for ‘net zero’ greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The Department plans to launch a net zero strategy before the UK hosts the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) conference in November 2021. The Department aims that the strategy will set out the government’s vision for transitioning to a net zero economy, providing much needed clarity for stakeholders. But this nonetheless means that it will have taken Government over two years to set out its plans. Prior to the launch of the strategy, departments intend to publish several sector strategies, including for transport, heating, tree planting and energy. However, the publication of many of these strategies has already been delayed. For example, the Heat and Buildings strategy has been delayed from August 2020 to early 2021 at the earliest. The Department plans to publish many of the remaining strategies over the next 12 months but has not yet confirmed what will be published when. Recommendation: The Department should ensure that the key sector strategies, and the overarching net zero strategy, are published by September 2021. These strategies should include a clear timeline of key net zero milestones and decision points, to give Parliament and the public an overview of government’s net zero plans, what it plans to achieve and when.  2.  The Department is not yet reporting on the programmes across government that are crucial to the delivery of net zero in a way that enables Parliament or the public to scrutinise progress. In early 2019, government established new arrangements for coordinating the departments involved in achieving net zero. The Department has overall responsibility for achieving net zero and for ensuring cross-government arrangements are working effectively and that departments are reducing emissions over time towards achieving net zero. But there is no single place where information is brought together about the overall progress of key net zero policies, or a clear set of measures which can be consistently used to judge progress. This limits the Department’s ability to identify potential issues with achieving net zero and take corrective action if necessary. The Department is working with the Climate Change Committee to develop new measures of progress that are more straightforward to understand, which it expects could be used both for monitoring as well as in public communication of progress towards net zero. The Department must publish its plans and targets for all sectors and make clear to the public how government actions, such as the recent decision not to intervene over the local granting of planning permission to a coal mine in Cumbria, are consistent with its trajectory to net zero. Otherwise, government runs the risk of sending the wrong messages to the public about its commitment to this goal. Recommendation: The Department should develop a clear set of metrics that provide a system-wide view of progress towards net zero. These metrics, which should include reporting on progress of emissions levels compared to expectations within each sector, should be reported regularly from the end of 2021, in as close to real time as is feasible and produced in a user-friendly manner for the public.  6  Achieving Net Zero  3.  HM Treasury has not yet clarified how it will ensure net zero is given adequate weight in the assessment of government policies and projects. Achieving net zero will be an all-encompassing challenge requiring all parts of government to contribute to reducing emissions. Therefore, government must build net zero into the structures and processes that govern departmental spending and prioritisation. For example, by assessing the carbon impact of new projects or programmes to consider their impact on achieving net zero. The Treasury’s Green Book guidance requires all policy, programme and project proposals to consider environment and climate impacts, including UK greenhouse gas emissions. The Treasury has recently reviewed this guidance and is now looking to place more emphasis on strategic objectives such as net zero in the assessment of proposals. But departments’ capability to assess climate impacts is varied, with the skills needed concentrated in the Department. The requirements as set out in the revised Green Book will have less impact than the Treasury intends, and ultimately programmes will not contribute to achieving net zero, if a lack of capability across departments means they are not put into practice. Recommendation: HM Treasury should, within two months, write to us outlining:  4.  •  how it will ensure its guidance, such as the Green Book, will lead to departments adequately considering and reporting the impact of policy decisions on net zero; how all fiscal stimulus packages and infrastructure proposals will be stress tested against net zero and what measures will be incorporated into the Green Book to ensure projects are only approved if they align with 2050 net-zero target; and  •  how it will ensure the development of skills across Whitehall to assess the impact of decisions on net zero.  Government does not have a clear way of determining whether its actions to reduce emissions in the UK are transferring emissions to other countries. The net zero target applies to emissions generated within the UK and does not include emissions from the production of goods that are imported. This approach aligns with internationally agreed rules to prevent double counting of emissions. It is critical that actions to reduce the UK’s emissions do not result in simply moving them abroad, which would undermine global efforts to limit temperature rises. This could happen, for example, if UK policies push high-emitting industries (such as some manufacturing) abroad rather than ensuring those industries become carbon neutral. HM Treasury considers that this risk is lessened as other countries reduce their own emissions. But if the UK decarbonises more quickly than other countries (particularly countries it imports from), there will be a risk in the short term that policies to reduce emissions transfers them abroad instead. Recommendation: The Department should review how policies aimed at reducing UK-based emissions take into account the risk that emissions are passed to other countries and explore how to make the level of emissions generated in the manufacture of imported goods more transparent.  5.  Government has not adequately communicated to the general public the changes that individuals will need to make in the transition to net zero emissions.  Achieving Net Zero  7  Achieving net zero will depend on individuals choosing to change their behaviour, from personal lifestyle choices, as well as decisions that rely to some degree on related technological developments such as buying an electric car or changing how they heat their homes. The Climate Change Committee estimated in 2019 that 62% of remaining emissions reductions will rely to some degree on individual choices and behaviours. But there is a disconnect between people’s concern about climate change and their understanding of what is required to achieve emissions reductions in the UK. There has so far been no coordinated government messaging about the changes and choices people will need to make. A key challenge will be engaging with, and supporting, those who are currently employed in sectors that will either decline as part of the transition to net zero, such as oil and gas extraction, or will need to significantly change, such as mechanics who must transition to working primarily on electric vehicles. Supporting these people could be complementary to the ‘levelling up’ agenda whereby Government aims to create opportunity for everyone in all regions and address disparities in economic and social outcomes. The Department established a public engagement team to begin work in April 2020 but accepts that it needs to do more on its communication with the public. Recommendation: The Department should, in the next 12 months, develop a public engagement strategy that sets out how communications will be coordinated. 6.  The Department has not sufficiently engaged with local authorities on their role in the achievement of net zero across the UK. Local authorities have significant scope to influence emissions in their area, both by leading decarbonisation of sectors (such as housing and transport) and by influencing local businesses and residents to take climate action themselves. However, local government representatives report a lack of clarity from central government on the role local authorities should play in achieving net zero, what will be expected of them or how they will be supported. The Local Government Association’s Climate Change Survey 2020 found that nine out of 10 councils have declared a climate emergency and 80% have set a carbon neutral target. But local authorities face a wide range of barriers to tackling climate change. Ninety-six per cent of local authorities report that funding is a barrier to them tackling climate change, and 93% that legislation or regulation is a barrier. Lack of workforce capacity or a lack of skills is also a cause for concern, with 88% and 78% of local authorities in the survey respectively reporting this as a barrier to tackling climate change. Recommendation: Government should respond with a coherent National Fiscal and Policy Framework. This should set out Government’s national responsibilities. Local Authorities local and regional responsibilities and be clear how government proposes to work with local authorities to secure the funding, skills, resources and outcomes required to deliver Net Zero.  8  Achieving Net Zero  1 Net zero plans and progress 1. On the basis of a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General, we took evidence from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (the Department) and HM Treasury about achieving net zero.1 2. In June 2019, government passed legislation committing it to achieving ‘net zero’ greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This means reducing emissions substantially from current levels, requiring the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2050 to be equal to or less than what is removed from the atmosphere by either the natural environment or carbon capture technologies. Government set the net zero target to deliver on the commitments it had made by signing the Paris Agreement in 2016. As part of the Paris Agreement,189 countries and territories committed to pursuing ways to limit global temperature rises this century to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to try to limit the temperature increase further to just 1.5 degrees Celsius.2 3. Net zero is an increase in ambition from the government’s previous target, set in 2008, to reduce net emissions by 80% by 2050 compared with 1990 levels. In 2018, the UK emitted 496 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (the unified measure of greenhouse gas emissions combining all greenhouse gases). Between 2008 and 2018, the UK’s emissions reduced by 28%, faster than any other G20 economy. The power sector was responsible for 56% of the overall decrease in emissions between 2008 and 2018, industry for 22% and waste for 9%. Reducing emissions further to achieve net zero is a colossal challenge, requiring wide-ranging changes to the UK economy and to the way we all live our lives, including further investment in renewable electricity generation, as well as changing the way people travel, how land is used and how buildings are heated.3 4. The Department has overall responsibility in government for achieving net zero. It also has lead responsibility for decarbonising many of the highest-emitting sectors of the economy, such as power and industry. HM Treasury has a key role to play given it allocates budgets to government departments. It is central to assessing the relative priority of policies across government and ensuring that departments have sufficient financial resources to manage programmes aimed at reducing emissions. The Department must work with devolved administrations and other departments, like the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG), Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Department for Transport, which each hold responsibility for decarbonisation in their respective policy areas.4  Plans for achieving net zero 5. Government introduced the net zero target through an amendment to the Climate Change Act (2008), which originally set a target of at least an 80% reduction in net greenhouse gas emissions in the UK relative to 1990 levels. Government also aimed to set an example for other countries to follow in the run-up to hosting the 26th United Nations’ Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26). The Climate Change Act required government to set ‘carbon budgets’, legally binding targets for UK emissions over 1 2 3 4  C&AG’s Report, Achieving net zero, Session 2019-21, HC 1035, 4 December 2020 Q 1: C&AG’s Report, paras 1, 1.2-1.3 C&AG’s Report, paras 2, 1.6, 1.8-1.9, Figure 2 and Figure 4 C&AG’s Report, paras 3, 1.5, 1.15-1.16, Figure 5  Achieving Net Zero  9  a five-year period. The first five carbon budgets, up to 2032, were set to achieve progress towards the 80% reduction target.5 In December 2020, the Prime Minister announced a new target to reduce the UK’s emissions by at least 68% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels to put it on a pathway to net zero.6 The Climate Change Committee (CCC), which advises the UK and devolved administrations on meeting their emissions reductions targets and preparing for climate change, has recommended that the UK sets a Sixth Carbon Budget to require a reduction in UK greenhouse gas emissions of 78% by 2035 relative to 1990, in line with net zero.7 6. The UK met the first and second carbon budget and the Department currently forecasts that it is very likely to achieve the third carbon budget but will fall short against carbon budgets 4 and 5, from 2023 to 2027 and 2028 to 2032, respectively. We asked the Department how it could be confident that it would achieve the new 68% target when it was off track for the less ambitious fourth and fifth carbon budgets and what action it was taking to get back on track. The Department explained that it would establish additional policies to close the gap by publishing sector strategies over the next year, culminating in an overall net zero strategy. The Department told us that its success to date in achieving reductions in carbon emissions gave it confidence it could make the huge transformation needed. However, the majority of the reductions so far have been achieved in the power sector and required less behaviour change by consumers than would be necessary for other sectors that need to decarbonise, such as heat and transport.8 7. The government originally planned to publish many of its strategies during 2020. Publication was later than it previously intended, partly because of reprioritisation of Government activity in response to the coronavirus crisis.9 For example, the publication of the Heat and Buildings strategy was delayed from August 2020 and is yet to be published. Publication of the Fuel Poverty strategy was similarly delayed from April 2020 and did not publish until to February 2021.10 The Department told us that it would like to have published many of the sector strategies months earlier than they were likely to be published. It asserted that it was now in a good place to publish them and expected the strategies to be stronger as a result of the delay and would reflect a greater degree of political commitment. It accepted that the strategies would need to be clear, and provide detail, about the policies, timing and process that underpinned them. It told us that this particularly applied for high-emitting sectors including buildings, transport and industry. We asked the Department when the strategies were now due to be published and to provide a publication programme for the next 12 months. The Department would not provide details of the months that it planned to publish the individual strategies, asserting that it would ‘put them out at the right time, when they are ready’. It told us it expected the Heat and Building strategy and the fuel poverty strategy very soon, followed by the industrial decarbonisation, hydrogen and transport strategies.

The Department told us that it was ‘very confident’ that it would be able to publish a net zero strategy in advance of COP26.11  Progress monitoring 8. In early 2019, government established new coordination arrangements for the departments involved in achieving net zero. The arrangements include: cabinet committees for climate action strategy (chaired by the Prime Minister) and implementation; a Climate Change National Strategy Implementation Group (NSIG) of senior officials from the main departments involved; a net zero steering board for strategy and delivery supporting the NSIG; and boards within departments to oversee progress of emissions reductions.12 The Department’s overall responsibility for achieving net zero means it is responsible for ensuring cross-government arrangements are working effectively. The NAO found that while the Department reported actual and forecast greenhouse gas emissions annually and progress against the carbon budgets, giving it a high-level view of whether the UK is on track to meet net zero, it had not yet embedded performance monitoring into its crossgovernment coordination arrangements. It did not have a consolidated list of policies key to achieving net zero, nor did it collate data on how these policies were performing overall. This meant that the Department could not identify the key risks and issues emerging across government activities to achieve net zero that needed to be escalated to senior groups such as the cabinet committees.13 9. We asked what the Department was doing to ensure that it would be able to track progress towards net zero when responsibility was shared across departments. The Department told us that the new coordination structures provided it with clarity on total emissions and the level of emissions for which each department has responsibility. It asserted that this meant each department could be held to account for its area of responsibility while the Department was overall accountable for total emissions. It also explained that departments would be set an overall emissions ‘envelope’, which all emissions related to their policy decisions must come in under and that this envelope would fall over time. The Department acknowledged that it needed to enhance its reporting on the different net zero delivery programmes across government and told us that it had tasked a net zero governance team to work on this issue.14 The Treasury told us that the Department was working with the Climate Change Committee (CCC) to develop measures that could be used to track progress. It explained, however, that it would take ‘some time’ to develop this and make sure that it was designed and implemented in the right way, but that it hoped to improve the data and information available to make policy and spending decisions this year.15 10. We asked the Department about the recent decision to allow deep coal mining in Whitehaven, Cumbria and how this aligned with the government’s intention to move away from depending on fossil fuels and towards cleaner energy sources. The Department told us that the mine in question was for coking coal rather than producing power, a necessary fuel for steel production for which there is, currently, no green substitute. 11 12 13 14 15  Qq 18-19, 23 C&AG’s Report, para 2.2, Figure 6 Q 30; C&AG’s Report, paras 3, 16, 3.15-3.16 Qq 31, 33, 45 Qq 58-60; C&AG’s Report, para 3.15  Achieving Net Zero  11  The Department stated that the steel industry was expected to decarbonise later than other sectors but accepted that the UK nonetheless needed to move to clean steel. More broadly, the Department commented that it is not possible simply to “switch off” certain high-emitting industries and acknowledged that there is a need to help the public better understand that net zero will come in stages with some industries decarbonising later than others.16 We asked that the Department ensures it publishes targets and milestones encompassing all sectors and that these are brought together and updated regularly so the public can see, in one place, what progress has been made.17  Appraising policies and projects 11. Net zero is an all-encompassing challenge that will affect every part of government. It will not be achieved if it is not sufficiently prioritised when departments make decisions that could impact on greenhouse gas emissions.18 We asked whether other departmental priorities, such as building enough homes, could supersede net zero and if the Department had the power to overrule these decisions in favour of net zero. We also asked how net zero was being prioritised in decisions like the granting of North Sea oil and gas licences, which could send the wrong message to the public about Government’s commitment to net zero. The Department explained that achieving net zero relied on its system of collective ownership, which should ensure everyone acted in support of the overall goal, rather than one department directing all others. The Department expected that where departments consistently fall behind, they would be held to account through the new coordination arrangements, which run from the Prime Minister and the Cabinet Committees, to the relevant secretary of state and the department itself, to ensure necessary action was taken to achieve net zero. The NAO found that spending reviews, led by HM Treasury, will be crucial to achieving net zero, as they allocate budgets to departments in the medium term (typically three to five years) and will provide an opportunity to encourage a coordinated approach. The Treasury and Department agreed that an important change in the most recent spending review was including officials from the Department to help scrutinise departments’ bids to ensure they aligned with the wider net zero strategy.19 12. The Treasury’s Green Book guidance requires all policy, programme and project proposals to consider environment and climate impacts, including UK greenhouse gas emissions. The Department noted that this was another means by which the compatibility of departments’ decisions with net zero could be taken into account.20 HM Treasury has recently reviewed the Green Book guidance, due to concerns that the guidance may undermine the Government’s aim to “level up” poorer parts of the UK. The updated Green Book emphasises the importance of demonstrating the fit of a proposed intervention with government’s strategic objectives, such as net zero, and highlighting whether it supports or conflicts with them.21 The Treasury told us that departments, in line with Green Book guidance, should be considering the impact of policies on wider strategic objectives, such as net zero, even if policies were not directly related to climate change.22 16 17 18 19 20 21 22  Qq 5-6, 36 Qq 23, 29 C&AG’s Report, para 3, 2.11 Q 31-33, 36; C&AG’s Report para 10, 2.11 Q 32; C&AG’s Report para 2.12 HM Treasury, Green Book Review 2020: Findings and response, Box 2.A, para 1.3, 3.5 Qq 54, 64  12  Achieving Net Zero  13. We asked what impact measures such as the Green Book guidance had on major infrastructure projects like High Speed 2. The Department told us that departments were each responsible for ensuring that the projects within their areas remained below their overall emissions envelope and that it did not micromanage individual projects. It explained that in the case of the Department for Transport, the plans to achieve net zero would include a range of transport modes, from cycling, walking, cars, trains and planes, as well as core infrastructure projects such as HS2. It explained that this provided departments flexibility to balance their projects’ greenhouse gas emissions as if they went over on one project, the departments would need to find savings elsewhere.23 14. We asked the Treasury why, in its updated Green Book, it had not introduced a specific requirement for policies to explain how they aligned with net zero. The Treasury told us that the guidance already required Departments to consider greenhouse gas emissions as part of their appraisal process.24 The NAO found, however, that Departments’ adherence to guidance, including that in the Green Book, was often inconsistent. The Treasury accepted that taking greenhouse emissions into account was “not always happening on a consistent basis” and that it needed to do more to set the expectations of Departments.25 In the most recent spending review, the Treasury asked departments to provide a detailed assessment of the climate impact of their capital expenditure plans, but not all departments did so. It explained that the main issue was the capability of departments, as much of the capability for assessing the climate impact of policies sits within the Department. The Treasury recognised that there was more it could do to ensure departments have the tools and capabilities to assess the climate impact of policies.26  Impact on global emissions 15. Limiting global temperature rises to reduce the climate change impacts will require a global reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The net zero target applies to emissions generated in the UK and does not include emissions generated in the production of goods imported into the UK. This is consistent with internationally-agreed rules around climate change targets to prevent double counting of emissions.27 We asked about the potential risk that if Government policies reduce emissions in the UK but at the expense of higher emissions abroad then the UK’s progress towards net zero could mask the fact that global emissions are not reducing.28 The CCC found that the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions were 69% higher in 2016 if emissions generated in imports were included and that imported emissions have risen as a fraction of the UK’s total greenhouse gas emissions. This, it reported, reflected the UK’s progress in reducing emissions domestically and that the UK imports energy-intensive industrial products like steel. The CCC also emphasised the importance of government prioritising actions that reduce both UK-generated emissions and imported emissions, such as increasing energy efficiency and reducing waste.29 16. We asked how the Department would ensure that the impact of the UK’s progress towards net zero would not inadvertently result in higher emissions elsewhere.

HM Treasury similarly told us that as other countries decarbonise, imports from those countries will have less embedded carbon and so the risk of pushing emissions abroad would be reduced. The Department told us that emissions generated in imports were difficult to estimate, which is why it was not used as an overall target. It noted that preventing the export of emissions in general relied on careful policy design. For example, regulating the carbon make-up of products on the market, rather than solely regulating how goods are made in this country.30 17. We asked about the feasibility of a tax based on carbon embedded in imports (a carbon border adjustment tax) to reduce the risk of pushing emissions abroad. The Treasury told us that it was considering this as part of its net zero review. It explained that it needed to further investigate the proposal, particularly whether it would be effective in maintaining UK jobs and facilitating decarbonisation in the Global South, how it could be implemented and whether it would comply with World Trade Organisation rules. It explained that the European Commission was considering a carbon border adjustment tax and it expected to learn from this about how the UK could tackle the issue of imported carbon in future.31  30 31  Qq 20-21 Qq 21-22  14  Achieving Net Zero  2 Wider engagement Engaging with the general public 18. Achieving net zero will depend on people changing their habits and lifestyles, adopting new technologies, and in some cases big personal investments. For example, buying zeroemission vehicles, such as electric vehicles, instead of cars that run on petrol or diesel; changing the way they heat their homes by replacing domestic gas boilers with renewable alternatives, such as electric heat pumps; and lifestyle changes such as consuming fewer meat and dairy products. The Climate Change Committee (CCC) estimated in 2019 that 62% of the remaining emissions reductions will happen either through individual choices and behaviours, some of which will require the development of new technologies. But it also found that there was a disconnect between people’s concern about climate change and their understanding of what is required to achieve emissions reductions in the UK.32 19. We asked the Department what it was doing to ensure the step change needed by members of the public to achieve net zero and how it was communicating to people about the decisions or changes they needed to make and when. The Department told us that so far, a lot of the changes to reduce emissions reductions have not required major behavioural change, but many of those that will be needed in the future will do. It explained that, where possible, it would look for solutions that did not require “excessively drastic behaviour change” which was why initiatives such as electric vehicles were so important. In April 2020, the Department established a behaviour change and public engagement team for net zero to begin designing a public engagement strategy and share good practice across government. The Department accepted, however, that it was not yet providing an integrated picture of public engagement and that there was more work it needed to do to address this gap in 2021.33 It told us that it would be important to ensure that its public engagement strategy was sufficiently broad to allow the public to understand the wider context of its communications and messages. For example, it explained that it would be important to enable people to understand the continuing importance in the short term of high-emitting industries, such as coal, oil and gas, and their role in employment and the resilience of the energy system.34 20. Government investment in new technologies, such as carbon capture and storage, could benefit particular regions of the UK and support the government’s levelling up agenda, which aims to create opportunity for everyone in all regions and address disparities in economic and social outcomes.35 We asked the Department about ensuring the transition to a net zero economy was done in a just way, in particular the planned skills and training support for people working in sectors expected to decline or change significantly as part of the move to net zero, so that they were prepared for the change. We specifically asked about people who will have to move into different kinds of employment, such as car manufacturing moving to predominantly electric vehicles or people moving from the oil and gas sectors into solar power. The Department confirmed that developing these skills would be very important, but told us that while this was a big area of focus, there was time before developing sectors such as carbon capture will be employing people 32 33 34 35  Q 34, C&AG’s Report paras 8, 3.23, Figure 12 Q 34; C&AG’s Report, para 8 Qq 36-37 C&AG’s Report, paras 1.9  Achieving Net Zero  15  at scale. It noted that, as one of the important opportunities for new job creation, it would be important to ensure that plans for net zero provided job in the right locations and weren’t only concentrated in the south-east. It also recognised that it would need to ensure that its plans were integrated into the Department for Education’s work on skills and explained it was working with the Department for Education to identify the people and skills the industries affected would need.36  Engaging with local authorities 21. Local authorities have a key role to play in achieving net zero. They have significant scope to influence emissions in their area, for example, by leading decarbonisation of sectors such as housing and transport. These represent a substantial proportion of UK emissions, and where the emissions reduction challenge will vary by location. Local authorities can also influence local businesses and residents to take climate action themselves. The NAO found that government’s co-ordination arrangements for net zero only extended to central government departments.37 We received written evidence from the Local Government Association (LGA), which told us that the Government needed to outline national and local government responsibilities and commit to working with local government bodies to deliver net zero. It also told us that there needed to be an engagement process between central and local government to support councils to develop local net zero delivery plans and invest in green solutions.38 The Department agreed that local authorities were very important partners in delivering decarbonisation schemes such as the green homes grant and the local authority delivery scheme. It also recognised that local authorities had a lot of the planning capabilities and statutory duties which would be very important for example, when thinking about investment in heat networks. It accepted that it would be increasingly important to engage with local authorities.39 22. In written evidence, the LGA told us that there was a long-term funding gap in government’s ambitions to decarbonise housing. In February 2020, the LGA’s Climate Change Survey 2020 found that nine out of 10 councils had declared a climate emergency and 80% had set a carbon neutral target.40 But the survey found that local authorities faced numerous barriers to tackling climate change. Ninety-six per cent of respondents reported that funding was a barrier to their local authority tackling climate change, and 93% that legislation or regulation was a barrier. Lack of workforce capacity or a lack of skills was also a cause for concern, with 88% and 78% of local authorities in the survey respectively reporting this as a barrier to tackling climate change. Respondents who noted legislation or regulation as a barrier highlighted a range of issues including building regulations not being environmentally rigorous and that the National Planning Policy Framework or planning regulations were insufficiently ambitious.41 23. The Department acknowledged that it needed to consider place-related aspects to achieving net zero and how local authorities could be involved in co-ordinating the changes needed in areas such as transport and energy.42 The Department told the National 36 37 38 39 40 41 42  Qq 52-53, 65-67 C&AG’s Report, para 2.19-2.21 Local Government Association submission para 4 Q 39 Q 43; Local Government Association submission para 7 Local Government Association submission para 7; Local Government Association, Climate Change Survey, Research report, February 2020 pages 2, 35 Qq 40-41  16  Achieving Net Zero  Audit Office that it intended to engage with local authorities about their role as part of the creation of the net zero strategy.43 During our evidence session, the Department further committed to actively engaging with local authorities on how sector strategies will be rolled out, as the strategies were published. The Department noted that it had provided toolkits to raise the capability and capacity within local authorities and has local energy hubs to enable engagement with them. These hubs aimed to help local authorities to develop plans to attract investment and fund the development and sharing of best practice between local authorities.44  43 44  C&AG’s Report, paras 11, 2.22 Qq 39, 44; C&AG’s Report, para 2.22  Achieving Net Zero  17  Formal minutes Monday 1 March 2021 Virtual meeting Members present: Meg Hillier, in the Chair Mr Gareth Bacon  Mr Richard Holden  Olivia Blake  Sarah Olney  Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown  James Wild  Peter Grant Draft Report (Achieving Net Zero), proposed by the Chair, brought up and read.

We are in the midst of a global pandemic, in a shifting constitutional landscape with the UK no longer a member of the EU, and with the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in November refocusing attention on tackling the threat of climate change. In many ways, this Senedd is at the beginning of a road taking us into uncharted territory, with everyone asking the same question: what’s next? Members of the Sixth Senedd will have to make some huge decisions about the future of Wales, from dealing with hospital waiting lists to air quality, post pandemic economic recovery to education reform. Themes like digital transformation, inequality, constitutional change and public finances will likely influence decision-making too. Access to independent research and analysis to inform these decisions is more important than ever, especially in a world where information is readily available but also increasingly contested. Senedd Research is an impartial research and information service. Our work is designed to help all Members of the Senedd and their staff scrutinise legislation, hold the government to account and support constituents. We do this through a confidential enquiry service open to all Members, and in our support for Senedd committees. We also publish a wide range of impartial and accessible research articles aimed at Members and their staff, which are available for everyone to read on our website. Our researchers are policy experts who have a wealth of knowledge and experience. The team also supports the exchange of knowledge and expertise between external researchers and the Senedd, working with academics and institutions from Wales and beyond.  Title: Research Briefing  This publication is a great starting point for everyone interested in getting to grips with the challenging social, economic and public policy issues of the day.

Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  The COVID-19 pandemic: where are we? Over the past year we have learned more about the virus, how it spreads, what treatments are effective, and developed vaccines. But where are we on the journey of the pandemic? And what might be around the corner for the new Senedd and Welsh Government? Lucy Morgan For more than a year the world has been gripped by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is one of the biggest public health challenges of our time, and the wider social and economic impact is exceptional. On 11 March 2020 the World Health Organisation (WHO) first described COVID-19 as a pandemic. Less than two weeks later everyone in the UK was told to stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives. While restrictions were eased over the summer, cases began to rise again in the winter months and the stay at home rules came back into force. The four governments of the UK introduced a range of measures to tackle the virus and, while broadly following the same strategy, they have often taken different steps at different times.  The current state of the pandemic The pandemic changed our lives in ways that would have been unimaginable at the start of 2020. Our freedoms, life plans, and opportunities have been restricted for long periods of time, some of which will have far-reaching consequences. The restrictions have largely been underpinned by laws, which are reviewed every three weeks, alongside detailed guidance. The previous Welsh Government set out a coronavirus control plan, which consisted of four alert levels. The plan was updated in March in light of the more transmissible Kent variant of the virus and the impact of the vaccine rollout.  10  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Over the last few months Wales has slowly moved from the highest alert level 4 and into alert level 3. The then First Minister, Mark Drakeford, set out a more detailed timeline of how restrictions will be eased through to the middle of May. The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines started in December. Since then (at the time of writing) more than 1.6 million people have received a first dose of a vaccine (which is 51% of the Welsh population), and more than 550,000 have received both doses (17% of the population). The previous Welsh Government aimed to offer a vaccine to all adults by the end of July.  The immediate challenges There are a number of immediate challenges facing the new Senedd and Welsh Government due to the pandemic. The vaccine programme The four UK governments have been in a cycle of imposing and easing restrictions for over a year. The vaccines are hailed as an end to these lockdowns, but will this actually be the case? While the vaccination programme is progressing at speed, there are still some issues. So far, vaccine uptake has been lower than average among some ethnic groups and in deprived areas, following patterns seen in previous vaccination programmes. Public Health Wales has raised concerns about the “significant inequalities in coverage of COVID-19 vaccine”. The biggest cause for alarm is that the same groups with lower levels of uptake of the vaccine are also the ones who are at a higher risk of death from COVID-19. A resurgence of the virus is likely because many people are not protected from COVID-19, either because they haven’t been vaccinated or because the vaccine won’t prevent all infection or illness. This means that communities where uptake is lower will be particularly at risk from an increase in the transmission of COVID-19. The Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines are showing early signs of reducing the risk of hospitalisation. AstraZeneca are also reporting that its vaccine has the potential to reduce asymptomatic transmission of the virus by 67%.  11  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  But new variants of COVID-19 are emerging and one of the biggest risks is that “they may be more transmissible or they may bypass the vaccines”. The UK Government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) warns of the threat posed by new variants to the UK even if a high proportion of the population were vaccinated. It’s hoped that the vaccines can be tweaked to tackle a variant, with the possibility of a booster jab being provided later in the year if necessary. But the problems with vaccine uptake among certain communities will be harder to solve. And what role could ‘vaccine passports’ play in the coming months as the economy and society open up? There are ethical, privacy, and legal issues as well as human rights concerns that will need to be considered alongside any such policy. Keeping the virus under control At the beginning of 2021 a number of scenarios were modelled, with all outcomes resulting in a third wave of the pandemic. Imperial College London stated that “due to eligibility and vaccine hesitancy, vaccination alone will not be sufficient to keep the epidemic under control”, and advised that restrictions should be lifted slowly, with some remaining in place throughout 2021. SAGE advises that it’s easier to maintain control of the epidemic when levels of prevalence are low because “it provides more time to respond to increases before healthcare systems are overwhelmed [and] allows test, trace and isolate systems to operate more effectively”. Wales’ Test, Trace, Protect (TTP) system will continue to play a crucial role in maintaining control of the virus to identify who has COVID-19 and their recent contacts and requiring them to self-isolate to stop transmission. Testing and subsequent genomics also help identify new variants and their characteristics. England and Scotland published timelines for easing restrictions early in 2021. A key issue for the new Welsh Government will be balancing the scientific advice for a slow and cautious reopening against various social, economic, and political pressures.  12  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  The long term issues and recovery Attention will soon turn to the longer term handling of the pandemic and managing its impact. Some argue for a ‘zero COVID’ or elimination approach to break the cycle of lockdowns, similar to New Zealand. But not all believe it’s possible to achieve given that countries will have to open up their borders at some point. Others advocate ‘herd immunity’ due to the harms caused by lockdowns, yet the threshold to achieve this is currently unknown and likely to be very high. The pandemic accelerated innovation in digital technology and reshaped how we work and learn. But the backlog in the NHS is now the worst on record and there are concerns about the effect of delayed treatments on patients’ wellbeing. Many children have experienced a year of disrupted learning with the gap in educational attainment growing. Some people have been disproportionality affected by the pandemic with existing inequalities being exacerbated. Meanwhile the response of the four UK governments in controlling the virus has thrown light on devolution across the UK with the differing rules between nations. Although we’re starting a new Senedd, the virus is still with us and presenting the same challenges as we’ve faced in the past year, along with some new ones. But there’s an opportunity to look to the future and to shape a post-pandemic Wales.

Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Is this the Brexit season f inale? For many, the announcement of a deal between the UK and EU on Christmas Eve 2020 marked the end of the longrunning Brexit negotiation drama. In reality, the agreement forms the bare outline of the future relationship plot. The twists and turns of what the relationship means in practice will be a key part of the Sixth Senedd’s story. Nia Moss, Sara Moran, Rhun Davies and Joe Wilkes At first glance, the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) is a free trade deal like any other. Yet it’s much more than that. It covers many areas not usually found in trade agreements such as health and social security. Its terms are lengthy, intertwined and complex. The majority of its provisions affect areas within the Senedd’s responsibility, from fisheries arrangements to healthcare insurance. Many of the details about how the TCA will work in practice are not yet clear. Welsh businesses and citizens still face uncertainty about what it means for them. The Sixth Senedd may find that the drama is far from over.  What’s been agreed and what does it mean for Wales? The TCA lays the foundation for the UK and EU’s new relationship. It follows the Withdrawal Agreement, which set the terms of the UK’s separation from the EU. The TCA is unprecedented because it resets the relationship between the UK and EU, in a way which puts them farther apart, rather than bringing them closer together. Even though it covers many areas of UK-EU cooperation, some important arrangements are not yet finalised.  14  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Areas covered by the new UK-EU relationship  Source: UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement  The TCA will shape many parts of life in Wales, such as business and trade environment, fisheries, health and travel.  Business and trade The way the UK trades with the EU has fundamentally changed. In the TCA, the UK and EU agreed that there are no tariffs or quotas on trade in goods, provided rules of origin are met. However, there are new non-tariff barriers which have resulted in increased costs for businesses. Some sectors, such as some shellfish producers, have also been unable to sell their produce to the EU due to its rules on trade with third countries. The EU introduced full border controls on goods from Great Britain on 1 January, while the UK will phase-in its border controls in stages until March 2022. New border infrastructure will need to be built in Wales, and the new Welsh  15  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Government will have some responsibilities in relation to border processes, such as checks on animals. The previous Welsh Government said that “the precise impact of the TCA will take time to become clear in many areas”. The Sixth Senedd will need to monitor its impact on Welsh businesses trading with the EU, as well as scrutinising how the new Welsh Government implements its responsibilities.  Environment and f isheries Environmental cooperation is folded into the TCA in a number of ways. On one hand, it makes up part of the so-called ‘level playing field’ to ensure fair competition between the UK and EU so that standards can’t be reduced without consequence. On the other, the entire partnership is based on a commitment to address climate change, which constitutes an essential element of this and all future UK-EU agreements. Fisheries arrangements became a sticking point in the negotiations but agreement was finally reached. One new arrangement provides that 25% of the EU’s quota in UK waters will be transferred to the UK over a five and a half year period. Many other parts of the TCA are linked to the fisheries arrangements. For example, if the UK or EU restricts access to their waters, the other can retaliate with tariffs. Or if one side decides to end the fisheries arrangements, the arrangements for aviation and road transport will also cease.  Health Different types of UK-EU cooperation on health are included in the TCA. For example, there’s a general duty to cooperate on serious cross-border threats to health. There are also specific provisions maintaining the validity of European Health Insurance Cards (EHIC) until their expiration, and on the rights of UK citizens travelling in the EU to access some types of healthcare, and vice versa.  Travel Rules on travel from Wales to EU countries, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein have changed under the TCA for holidays, work, study and residency. Changes include visa and permit requirements (depending on the length of stay and the country visited), additional passenger checks and new rules for driving, pet travel, mobile roaming and compensation if travel is disrupted.  16  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  On the horizon The TCA contains a number of future deadlines on decisions not taken in December 2020, including establishing new bodies to implement the agreement, and for the review of some of its provisions. Important deadlines fall during this Senedd’s term. The agreement establishes 24 UK-EU committees and working groups. They’ll play a crucial strategic role in overseeing and implementing the agreement, as well as on its future direction and content. Their membership, including what role devolved governments will play, is not yet agreed. A UK-EU Parliamentary Partnership Assembly will also be established. Discussions on its format and how it will engage the devolved legislatures are on-going. A joint review of the UK-EU agreement is required every five years. The agreement also allows either the UK or the EU to call for a review of the agreement’s trade provisions after four years if they believe that either side is not honouring its commitments on fair competition. This could lead to further changes in the trading relationship. Other parts of the agreement could also be included within this review. The agreement is complex and many of its provisions are yet to be ‘road-tested’. Agreeing how the text should be interpreted, and how it should operate in practice, is likely to take some time. For example, the agreement requires that UK and EU environmental supervisory bodies meet regularly and co-operate on the effective enforcement of the agreement’s environmental commitments. What form these meetings will take, who will be involved and what role devolved regulators will have, is yet to be decided. In addition, discussions will continue in some areas important to Wales where agreement wasn’t reached. These include protected Welsh food and drink names, EU funding programmes and the mutual recognition of professional qualifications (MRPQ).  “Much more to be done” The list of tasks for the Sixth Senedd in relation to the TCA and the Senedd’s future engagement with Europe is long. As the Fifth Senedd’s External Affairs And Additional Legislation Committee said, “there is much more to be done in terms of assessing the implications for Wales”.  17  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  The agreement is new and untested. The details of its practical operation are not yet agreed. It’s dynamic and will evolve and be reviewed during this Senedd. New relationships are bedding in, and the Senedd and Welsh Government will need to define and find their place in these. The effects of the new relationship on the UK constitution, and Wales’ place in World, will unfold as the Sixth Senedd progresses.

Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Are we at a tipping point of inequality? The landscape of inequality exposed by the pandemic largely followed the contours of existing disadvantage. But will previous approaches to reducing inequality be enough to counter these stark imbalances, or will new strategies be needed? And what role does data - or the lack of it - play? Hannah Johnson The language of equality is used across the political spectrum, from ‘social mobility’ to ‘levelling up’, and ‘intergenerational fairness’ to ‘social justice’. At the core is the idea that some people, groups, or areas are disproportionately or unfairly advantaged - whether economically, socially, culturally, or politically – because of systems and structures that enable it. The pandemic has brutally demonstrated what these inequalities mean for people’s lives on a scale not previously seen. Our chances of dying, getting seriously ill, losing jobs, experiencing abuse, or falling behind in education have been in part determined by who we are, our finances, our health, and where we live. These factors, intertwined with others like adequate housing, the ability to homework, and access to childcare, a car, outside space, and reliable internet, act to increase or decrease disadvantage. And it leads us to ask a fundamental question: is this fair? If not, what kind of policy interventions and systemic changes are needed to close the gaps?  Why is inequality a problem? We often hear that a rising tide of economic growth lifts all boats. But in reality, a rising tide of inequality sinks all boats. […] From the exercise of global power to racism, gender discrimination and income disparities, inequality threatens our wellbeing and our future. - United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres  19  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Inequality is increasingly a problem for us all. It’s estimated to cost the UK £39 billion a year, as managing the outcomes, like homelessness, are usually costlier than prevention. And while domestic abuse was recently estimated to cost the UK £66 billion a year, achieving economic gender equality could boost Wales’s economy by nearly £14 billion. Inequality might also slow down post-pandemic recovery. The lower take-up of vaccines among some ethnic groups and those living in the most deprived areas are of particular concern. Targeted misinformation, and long-term distrust of public authorities linked to structural and institutional racism and discrimination, are likely causes that will need more than a public engagement campaign to solve. Vaccination rates by WIMD quintile, ethnic group and age  Source: Public Health Wales: Wales COVID-19 Vaccination Enhanced Surveillance Report 2  Equal treatment or equal outcomes? Inequalities can be reduced either through universal policies that treat everyone the same, or by targeting them at those most in need. Proponents of ideas like a universal basic income (UBI) argue the pandemic has shown that resources for comprehensive social protection for everyone can be found. Others contend that ‘positive action’, which favours certain groups, helps to equalise outcomes by addressing historic disadvantage. ‘Proportionate universalism’ is somewhere in between, where services are available to all but with effort targeted where it’s most needed.  20  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  During the pandemic, some policies were targeted at people at higher risk based on their vulnerabilities. These include the ‘shielding’ programme, which recognised deprivation and ethnicity as risk factors in England, and the Welsh workforce risk assessment tool, which used demographics and health conditions to create a ‘risk score’ and suggested mitigation measures. The previous Welsh Government also launched a benefits take up campaign aimed at those most in need of financial support, and a helpline specifically for people from ethnic groups disproportionately affected by the virus.  What don’t we know? Absence of evidence isn’t evidence of absence. If interventions are targeted at those who lost the most in the crisis, it’s important that no-one is left uncounted. In 2020 a Senedd committee voiced concerns about the poor quality of equality data available in Wales. This was echoed by the House of Commons Women and Equalities Committee, which specifically called for the collection of redundancy data disaggregated by sex, ethnicity, and other characteristics. We also know that where these factors intersect, inequalities are amplified. Some groups were hit particularly hard by lockdown, when 39% of all female employees under 25, and 44% of workers of Bangladeshi ethnicity, were working in shut-down sectors in Wales. Overlaying this data allows for a more nuanced understanding of risk, power, wealth, security, need, and experience, rather than treating broad demographic groups as homogenous. The previous Welsh Government repeatedly emphasised its intersectional approach to equality. But a lack of disaggregated, intersectional data frustrates meaningful analysis. The collection of personal data by public authorities is sensitive, and requires trust. And targeting policies at certain groups can be seen as tokenistic or even discriminatory. These issues may present challenges for policy design in the coming years.  21  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Are the tools up to the job? The reduction of inequalities was at the core of the previous Welsh Government’s COVID-19 plan for recovery. It also set bold ambitions to become a ‘feminist government’, and a ‘world leader for gender equality’. In March 2021, the Socio-economic Duty was commenced in Wales. It requires most public authorities to consider how they can improve outcomes for people on low incomes when making strategic decisions. This will sit alongside the existing public sector equality duties, which compel Welsh public authorities to do things like conduct equality impact assessments, develop equality plans and objectives, and collect equality data. The Well-being of Future Generations Act also requires public authorities to think about the longterm impact of their decisions on equality and cohesion. But it’s difficult to measure the effectiveness of these duties. If inequalities in a particular policy area are not decreasing, does it indicate that the duty isn’t being fulfilled, or that it isn’t working? What if the levers of change aren’t devolved? And if an impact assessment uncovers an unfair impact, is there a duty to act on it? Does this approach make sure we collect quality data? With such unambiguous and widening inequalities at the forefront of political debate, the new Welsh Government will have to decide if previous approaches will work in the post-pandemic world. The Sixth Senedd will also be critical in challenging the new Welsh Government to show how it’s translating big ambitions on equality into tangible change.

Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  The digital uprising The pandemic put a stop to business as usual, pushing public services, companies, and individuals to rapidly adopt new behaviours. We’ve worked at home, shopped online, learnt remotely, and socialised from afar. The past year has also advanced the digital agenda and accelerated the speed of innovation . But what’s the role of policymakers in this increasingly virtual world? And how can inequalities caused by digital exclusion be reduced? Lorna Scurlock The world is changing. In 2016 it was declared that: We stand on the brink of a technological revolution that will fundamentally alter the way we live, work, and relate to one another. But the technology trends that propelled the fourth industrial revolution, known also as the ‘intelligence revolution’ or ‘industry 4.0’, have been accelerated further by the pandemic. One tech leader said they had seen “two years’ worth of digital transformation in two months”.  Heads in the cloud Storing and accessing data and programmes over the internet, known as ‘cloud computing’, has been vital in helping us adapt. Cloud computing was harnessed to support the public health response through contact tracing apps and virtual healthcare, and allowed the delivery of critical public services. The use of online team collaboration tools has soared, with Microsoft Teams experiencing a 40% increase in demand during lockdown. Cloud-based applications allowed educators to deliver online learning, and provided knockon positives for the environment too.  23  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  The flexibility of cloud computing helped shaped our lives and accelerated its adoption in 2020, with further growth forecast in 2021. But this comes with increased data safety and security risks, which will demand a proactive approach to keep cloud environments secure. And what skills will the workforce need to adapt to cloud computing long-term?  New digital habits While high street retailers have suffered, internet sales as a percentage of total retail sales in the UK rose from 22% at the beginning of March 2020, to over 36% in January 2021. Net profit for Amazon was up 84% for the year. This shift to digital transactions has also propelled growth in delivery, transportation, and warehouse jobs. It’s impossible to not mention the rise in video conferencing software. ‘Zoom’ was a verb in 2019, but is now a household company name. It is described as the pandemic’s success story, and has reported more than 300 million daily participants in virtual meetings. Video conferencing has enabled a safe continuation of a whole host of activities, not to mention the work of the Senedd, which was the first parliament in the UK to go virtual.  ’The great home-working experiment’ To minimise the risk of exposure to the virus, and supported by cloud computing, those that could, worked from home. This led to the reshaping of company culture, and a few interesting online interactions. Even Hollywood stars had to adapt. Recent research found that homeworking in Wales increased from 3.8% to 36.8% between March and April 2020. It also found 93.3% of employees wanted to continue working from home, suggesting that: … the great homeworking experiment will become an entrenched and widely accepted feature of work even when social distancing restrictions are fully lifted. The previous Welsh Government set a long-term ambition for 30% of the Welsh workforce to work remotely on a regular basis, and some employers have already  24  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  committed to more homeworking and less office space. Others are aiming for workforces to be ‘hyper-collaborative’ when in the office, and ‘hyper-productive’ when working at home. A report by McKinsey found that continued remote working and virtual meetings: … could prompt a large change in the geography of work, as individuals and companies shift out of large cities into suburbs and small cities. Office for National Statistics (ONS) analysis found that ‘those that could’ adapt to home working are employees in higher-paying jobs. Another study found that lower paid workers are more likely to lose their jobs as a result of the pandemic, potentially worsening existing inequalities in the labour market. What will be the impact of increased homeworking on our health and lifestyles? And will urban retail, hospitality, and public transport ever return to pre-pandemic levels?  A new revolution The ‘intelligence revolution’ means that an increasing range of intellectual tasks can be performed by AI, robotics, and automation, mirroring how the first industrial revolution drove the automation of repetitive physical tasks. The previous Senedd’s economy committee considered it ‘imperative’ that Wales should be “the provider, not just the consumer of emerging technologies”. A key message of the last Welsh Government’s 2019 review into digital innovation and the future of work was that: … over the next decade, digital technologies will result in both job displacement and creation, but of even greater significance is its impact on how we experience work. The proportion of jobs at high risk of automation by the early 2030s varies from 26% to over 36% across Welsh regions. A 2017 study into where automation will hit hardest found that: … the unequal geographical distribution of the impact of automation deserves immediate attention by Government, particularly as it is regions that have previously suffered the effects of industrial decline that are likely to be worst hit.  25  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  So how can policymakers make sure that digital innovation doesn’t create or worsen inequalities between people and regions? And how can sectors like manufacturing be equipped to take advantage of the new opportunities associated with technological change?  The need for speed Businesses and individuals with increasing digital demands need to be supported by reliable digital infrastructure. It is estimated that 94% of Welsh premises have access to superfast broadband. But a Welsh Government study from 2019 suggested around 79,000 properties do not, and with no prospect of connection in the next three years. Ofcom estimates that around 18,000 (1.2%) Welsh premises cannot access “decent broadband”. In December 2020 the National Infrastructure Commission (NIC) published a report into digital communications infrastructure. Among other things, this report concluded that: Too much attention has been paid by policymakers to promoting fibre to the home technology in the UK and not enough on improving mobile broadband provision.  New digital inequalities Despite being an integral part of modern society, internet accessibility isn’t equal, and 10% of people are still not online or using the internet regularly. Yet local infrastructure isn’t the only barrier to digital inclusion, and other challenges include low income and inability to get a data contract. ONS analysis exploring the digital divide shows that although digital skills are increasingly important, people remain excluded. Digital inclusion has been described as a “key social justice and equalities issue”. The previous Welsh Government’s digital inclusion strategy explains that the pandemic has: … drawn attention to the widening inequalities caused by digital exclusion in accessing services, receiving vital information and purchasing goods online. The accelerating shift of public services to online platforms risks further increasing the gap between the digitally included and excluded.  26  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  The Wales Centre for Public Policy says that Wales’ digital inclusion strategy needs to be “tailored to the challenges faced by different groups”, recognising that some will still need access to high quality in-person services. A new Digital Strategy for Wales and its delivery plan were recently published, setting out the last Welsh Government’s vision and ambition for a coordinated digital approach. But it’s clear that: … digital is not just about computers – it’s about people.

Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  How can Wales get the media it needs? Policymakers face a conundrum as to how to support a sector that is vital to democracy, but works best at a distance from those that wield democratic power. Robin Wilkinson What happens to a democracy when people lose access to trusted and reliable information about the people they can vote for? Since 1999, as the Senedd has gained further powers, professional journalism has retreated from local communities in Wales, as it has across the world. At the end of the Fifth Senedd, the Culture, Welsh Language and Communications (CWLC) Committee concluded that the “supply of media content for Wales is inadequate”. The biggest shortfall it identified was in news and current affairs.  Print pounds turn to digital pennies Welsh newspapers have seen continued decline in their print circulations. Since 2008 the Western Mail’s circulation has sunk by over three-quarters – from 37,576 to 8,419 in 2020. Over the same period, the Daily Post’s circulation has more than halved – from 36,432 in 2008 to 14,250 in 2020. This is in sync with what has happened in the UK dailies, with the Mirror and the Express both more than halving their circulations over the same period. These patterns are mirrored across the world. While print circulation has dwindled, online traffic has soared. WalesOnline’s use grew by over 1400% between 2008 and 2020, with monthly visitor numbers up from 680,000 in March 2008 to 9.7 million in June 2020. News organisations have struggled to monetise this increasing traffic. Other than a few examples, they have been reluctant to charge for access to their content, instead relying on digital advertising, the bulk of which is hoovered up by Google and Facebook. The result has been newspaper closures, job losses and market consolidation by the big players. These trends accelerated during the pandemic, despite increased news consumption. UK Government analysis in July 2020 suggested an advertising revenue reduction of 20.5% on the previous year for national  28  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  newspapers, and a 24.1% decline for regional newspapers. Declining print sales were further impacted by lockdowns, as shopping footfall plummeted.  Television and radio are losing audiences to unregulated competition News isn’t all about newspapers. Television remains the most common news source in Wales, being used by 75% of people, compared to 43% for radio, 33% for print newspapers, and 31% for other websites and apps – including those dedicated to news. But regulated broadcast services that carry news – such as the BBC, ITV and commercial radio – are all losing audiences to largely unregulated online competition such as Netflix and Spotify. These streaming platforms may carry some news and current affairs content, but they aren’t required to by regulation, and so far this content forms only an incidental part of their business models. A growing proportion of people – 46% in 2020 – gain their news from social media. Again, this is largely unregulated and, despite carrying reliable news from trusted sources, is bedevilled with concerns about disinformation and fake news  Loss of news suppresses voter turnout and increases corruption There are many theoretical arguments for the value of news journalism in a liberal democracy. These include encouraging an informed public, political accountability and plurality of opinion. Recent research, summarised in a report for the UK Government Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has given these claims an empirical basis. The authors found that an additional daily or weekly local newspaper title increased voter turnout by 1.27 percentage points, and that “the closure of local and regional news titles has led to underreporting and less scrutiny of democratic functions”. Other cited benefits of public interest journalism range from reducing political polarisation to saving public money by reducing corruption and public mismanagement. The devolved nature of many powers used to respond to the pandemic provided a worked example of the importance of Welsh news. In April 2020, the Fifth Senedd’s CWLC Committee wrote to the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee outlining the potential of misreporting to damage public health, citing inaccurate news reports from across the UK press. The most  29  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  popular print and online newspapers in Wales are the Mail and the Sun. Readers in Wales are therefore often reliant on London-based editors to clearly communicate what lockdown measures are in place in Wales. The Committee’s claims were backed-up by research by Professor Cushion at Cardiff University. He found that the “vast majority” of study participants could spot “fake news”, such as quack cures for COVID-19. But many cited “government or media misinformation” as sources of misleading information about the pandemic.  A challenge for policy makers, which the Welsh Government does not have all the tools to address The decline of news journalism provides a significant challenge for policy-makers. In recent history they have been able to rely on the market to provide a flow of broadly reliable and trustworthy news. The freedom of this market hasn’t been absolute – with newspapers longreceiving tax-breaks and implicit subsidies in the form of paid-for advertisements from public bodies. And broadcast media is either publicly-funded (such as the BBC and S4C) or regulated to ensure reliable news content. But this approach has helped politicians minimise the awkwardness of directly interfering in a sector that’s dependent on independence from the state to do its job. In 2018 the CWLC Committee called the retreat of news journalism from Wales “a profound public policy issue, which policy makers at all levels, not least the Welsh Government, need to address as a priority issue”. The previous Welsh Government accepted this recommendation in principle, but was limited in what it could do. “Broadcasting and other media” is a reserved matter, meaning that the power to pass laws in this area rests with the UK Parliament. This leaves direct funding as the main policy option for the Welsh Government. Welsh Governments have long-funded Welsh language news and current affairs, via the Welsh Books Council, in recognition of the market failure in this area. In recent years it’s provided funding for some English-language journalism, such as Nation.Cymru – via the Books Council, and ‘hyperlocal journalism’ via its own £200,000 Independent Community Journalism Fund. The argument, made by the CWLC Committee, that the market for English-language journalism in Wales has also failed, seemed to have been accepted by the previous Welsh Government.  30  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  The then Deputy Minister for Culture, Media and Sport, Lord Elis-Thomas, had previously said that it was “not for Welsh Government to be providing media outlets or supporting media outlets”. But by the end of the Fifth Senedd he revealed that discussions were “ongoing” to provide further support to Englishlanguage journalism “similar to the Welsh language model”. The Senedd Commission has also explored whether it could offer support to journalism. Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg has long called for the devolution of broadcasting to give the Welsh Government more tools to support the media. These proposals recently gained limited support from the CWLC Committee. But further powers would mean that tricky questions about how to increase public service content in an age of deregulation would be for the Welsh Government, rather than UK Government, to answer. Though several new news services for Wales have started in recent years (such as Nation.Cymru and The National), none of the broader market trends show any sign of abating. If politicians want people to know more about the people and institutions they vote for, it will be up to them to work out how.

Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  33  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Social care: a system at breaking point? The pandemic has drawn attention to the importance of the social care sector, but also demonstrated the fragility of the system. Will COVID-19 be a catalyst for change? Amy Clifton The stark pressures facing the social care sector have been brought into the spotlight during the pandemic. There’s a new recognition and appreciation of social care staff, but inequalities in how they are treated compared to NHS staff are even more exposed. The need for better support for Wales’ ever-increasing population of unpaid carers has also been highlighted. It’s widely accepted that fundamental reform of social care is long overdue. There have been numerous Welsh and UK Government papers and reports on reform, but the can has been repeatedly kicked down the road.  The social care workforce Care work is generally regarded as a low pay, low status profession, with limited opportunities for career progression. The sector suffers from staff shortages, high staff turnover, and major difficulties in recruitment. Social care is consistently losing staff to sectors like retail, which offer better pay and conditions. 56% of the social care workforce in Wales earn below the Real Living Wage (£9.50 an hour). Wages are similar in Wales and England, but markedly higher in Scotland. Residential care workers in Wales have faced a decade of no relative improvement in pay, and their median wage remained below the Real Living Wage for most of that period. Wages in residential care are also much lower than the service industry average.  34  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Distribution of gross hourly pay across sectors in Wales, 2020  Source: ONS, Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, 2020, Table 5.5a. Data point for the 90th percentile of residential care workers has been removed as the estimate is deemed unreliable.  During the pandemic the social care workforce faced trauma and significant personal risk, with workers in Wales and England twice as likely to die with COVID-19, compared to the general working-age population. In March the Fifth Senedd’s Health, Social Care and Sport (HSCS) Committee, alongside stakeholders, called for parity of esteem for social care workers with NHS staff, in terms of pay, working conditions and recognition. The Social Care Fair Work Forum (a partnership of Welsh Government, employers and unions) concluded later that month that the Real Living Wage should be the minimum pay received by social care workers. It sees this change as the most urgent priority to improve working conditions.  35  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  The role of unpaid carers The majority of care is provided by unpaid carers (typically family or friends) rather than commissioned services. Even before the pandemic it was estimated that unpaid carers provide 96% of all care in Wales. The replacement cost of care provided by unpaid carers (i.e. purchasing this care at market price) is estimated at £8 billion – roughly the same as the annual NHS Wales budget. Carers have taken on more caring responsibilities during the pandemic and are now said to be at breaking point, exhausted from long periods of caring without breaks or support. Support services such as respite care, which were already in short supply, have reduced or stopped altogether. Many carers are also struggling financially, and stakeholders want to see greater financial assistance made available. Any plans for social care reform must recognise the pivotal role of unpaid carers, which isn’t sustainable without improved access to support. As the Fifth Senedd’s HSCS Committee said: Carers give so much to the people they care for and without them, our health and social care systems would be overwhelmed and unable to function. They must be supported, recognised and rewarded to enable them to continue caring for as long as they wish to do.  The relationship between health and social care At the start of the pandemic, it was suggested that social care was an afterthought. Vital PPE and access to testing for care workers were significantly delayed in comparison to the NHS. Patients being discharged from hospitals to care settings (sometimes in the middle of the night) without a negative COVID-19 test result continues to be a cause for concern among stakeholders. The Association of Directors of Social Services (ADSS) Cymru says this has resulted in a significant breakdown of trust between care homes and hospitals. Carers charities also raised concerns about poor hospital discharge practices putting pressure on unpaid carers. Better integration of health and social care has long been a political ambition but real progress remains to be seen. In 2014, the last Welsh Government established an Integrated Care Fund (ICF), with the aim of driving this forward. However, the  36  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Wales Audit Office has been critical of the fund’s overall impact.  Service pressures The pandemic exacerbated the already precarious financial position of many care providers and provoked further doubt about the long-term viability of the current service model, particularly within the residential care market. Residential care is extremely fragmented. There are over 1,000 separate care homes, the vast majority of which are small, independent businesses, that provide the lion’s share of adult care home places. Number of adult care home places, by local authority and provider type, March 2021  Source: Care Inspectorate Wales, March 2021, user requested data. Data rounded to the nearest 10.  It’s widely accepted that the care system is underfunded, and local authority fee levels don’t appear to have kept pace with rising costs. Self-funders are effectively subsidising costs, on average paying around 25% more in care home fees than local authorities. Care homes need a high level of occupancy to be viable, but many have seen resident numbers drop during the pandemic, causing significant financial strain. Care homes have also struggled with serious staff shortages due to illness and staff needing to isolate. In December 2020, a number of care homes reached a  37  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  critical level of staff absence and were on the brink of closure. According to media reports, residents were close to being moved to hospital because of staffing levels. Increased demands and pressures also continue to be felt by home care providers, particularly with long COVID and patients who’ve had extended stays in hospital. Looking ahead, long COVID will continue to be a new pressure on services, adding a new group of service users who (without COVID) may not have needed social care.  Future demand Wales has an ageing population, and people are living for longer with complex care needs and dementia. This will no doubt continue to increase pressure on care services. The number of older adults living with severe dementia is predicted to double by 2040. Even before the pandemic, the Health Foundation estimated that the Welsh social care budget would need to reach £2.3 billion by 2030/31 to match demand. The previous Minister for Health and Social Services, Vaughan Gething, acknowledged that Wales’ already stretched services won’t meet future demand unless action is taken. He reported that spend on social services could be up to £400 million higher in 2022-23, just to maintain the current level of services. The last Welsh Government concluded that radical reform to improve social care wasn’t likely in the near future, given the challenging economic climate caused by the pandemic. The then Minister said that, in the shorter term, measures “working towards introducing a real living wage for the workforce” could be implemented “as quickly as is affordable”. As the Nuffield Trust notes, COVID-19 has pushed the demand for reform up the agenda: Never has social care been so prominent in public and political discussions. There is a groundswell of support for reform that presents a rare opportunity to achieve tangible change. Will this translate into action to improve social care by the next Welsh Government?  38  What’s next?

Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  A mentally well Wales What are the key challenges and opportunities for improving mental health and wellbeing in Wales? Philippa Watkins There were serious, long-standing concerns about mental health services in Wales before COVID-19 hit. Several Senedd committees highlighted long waiting times, high thresholds for treatment, and gaps in service provision. There are new fears about the impact of the ongoing pandemic on the mental health and wellbeing of the population, and on some groups in particular. The long-term effects of the pandemic on mental health are not yet fully understood. It’s clear that mental health has worsened, and there’s been an unequal impact on different groups. Young people and those living in poverty have been hit the hardest.  Mental ill health in Wales/UK  40  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Impact of the pandemic More than half of adults and three quarters of young people said their mental health was worse during the early months of the pandemic. It’s now clear that COVID-19 has had significant emotional impacts on the population. People have been exposed to greater levels of stress and anxiety as well as bereavement. They’ve also been less able to access their usual coping mechanisms (e.g. seeing friends and family, opportunities to exercise). While the distress experienced by many could be described as a ‘normal’ response to an extraordinary situation, people may still have needs for support. In addition, those with existing mental health problems may have seen their symptoms deteriorate. In its December 2020 report, the Fifth Senedd’s Health, Social Care and Sport (HSCS) Committee emphasised that appropriate support must be in place for everyone who needs it. This must cover the range of mental health need  41  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  - from low-level, early intervention support through to more specialist services and crisis care. It’s recognised that the mental health and wellbeing of some groups has been disproportionately affected. These include:   people with existing needs for mental health support;  people on low incomes, or who have seen their employment status change or are self-employed;   NHS and care workers, and other frontline staff;  Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities;  older adults; and  children and young people. Children and young people During the pandemic, young people reported a range of issues including increased anxiety, loneliness, and more limited access to mental health and other services they usually rely on. It’s feared that the disruption to their education, employment and training opportunities could have a significant, long-term impact on young people’s wellbeing. In October 2020, the Children, Young People and Education (CYPE) Committee published a follow-up to its landmark 2018 Mind over matter report. This sets out a ‘roadmap’ for improving emotional and mental health support for children and young people.  Key challenges and opportunities for the next Welsh Government Managing a backlog of patients alongside increased demand for services It’s expected to take several years for NHS services to recover and waiting times to return to pre-pandemic levels. Mental health was not in a strong position before COVID-19, with many people struggling to access timely, appropriate support. There’s been progress in some areas, such as the work in schools to improve support for pupils’ mental wellbeing. But there are still gaps in provision which  42  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  previous governments haven’t managed to address. For example, access to psychological therapies across Wales remains a challenge. Although mental health services in Wales were categorised as an essential service during the pandemic, many people were unable to access services or delayed seeking help. There are concerns about a potentially high burden of unmet need, and that some people with existing mental health problems may have become more severely ill. The Welsh Government’s health and social care recovery plan (March 2021) cautions that the NHS could be overwhelmed with referrals for mental health support. Notably, it says this will be driven by the socio-economic impacts of the pandemic (rather than medical/specialised mental health needs). Technology will play a greater role in the delivery of mental health services During the pandemic, more mental health services have been delivered remotely with face-to-face appointments significantly reduced. Remote/online services may be effective at meeting some needs for support, but might not be appropriate or accessible to all. For example, around 13% of households in Wales have no access to the internet. A recent evaluation of video consulting services suggests that there’s a “large appetite” for video consulting in Wales, with “high potential of sustainability and long-term use” beyond the pandemic. In the future, we’re likely to see a blended approach to mental health service delivery, with a combination of face-to-face and remote services. Addressing the ‘digital divide’ will be key. Better mental health services are needed, but this isn’t enough on its own A clear message from stakeholders is that ‘mental health’ does not just sit within the NHS - it is a much broader, public health issue. Preventing mental ill health spans government departments and all sectors of society. The Mental Health Foundation says: Prevention of mental health problems is possible through effective societal, community and individual support, but it cannot happen within the health sector alone – action must be taken in the spaces where people are born, raised and live (in the home, in schools, their communities and workplaces).  43  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  A greater focus on mental health In October 2020, the previous Welsh Government updated its mental health delivery plan to take account of the pandemic situation. It also appointed a new Minister for mental health and wellbeing. Its budget for 2021-22 includes increased funding for mental health services, and recognition that improving public mental health requires a whole-government approach: Further investment in mental health can be seen across government, in line with our approach to prevention and protection of mental health and well-being, including employment support, debt advice, housing support, sports and access to green spaces. In December 2020, the Welsh Government established the Together for Mental Health Ministerial Delivery and Oversight Board to strengthen governance arrangements around its mental health strategy and drive this work forward at greater pace.  Looking to the future The increased focus on mental health has been broadly welcomed. But will this be enough to tackle the impacts of the pandemic and deliver the whole-system approach needed to improve mental health and wellbeing in Wales? There is consensus that mental health has been chronically underfunded (not just in Wales but worldwide). Despite the high burden of disease from mental health problems, mental health receives a small fraction of overall health funding. An even smaller proportion of health research funding goes to mental health research. Concerns remain that mental health risks further de-prioritisation in the ongoing response to the pandemic and the recovery of routine healthcare services. Greater parity between mental health and physical health has long been called for by the sector and by Senedd committees. There may still be a long way to go before we get there. Committed leadership, joined-up policy, and appropriate budget allocations will be key to improving public mental health and developing mental health services fit for the future.  44  What’s next?

Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Hospital waiting times: a mountain to climb The COVID-19 pandemic has put enormous pressure on health services, with lengthening waiting times for treatment. What can be done to tackle the backlog? Paul Worthington In March 2020 all non-urgent hospital treatments were postponed, freeing up hospital capacity to deal with the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 pressures are now easing, but NHS Wales is facing a sizeable backlog. Over half a million patients are currently waiting for treatment for other conditions. How can our healthcare services respond to this challenge?  What’s the scale of the challenge? The Welsh Government’s targets for referral to treatment (RTT) are that 95% of patients referred for planned hospital treatment should be seen within 26 weeks, and 100% within 36 weeks. The RTT time also includes time waiting for out-patient appointments, tests, scans or other procedures that may be needed before being treated. There are other waiting times targets for diagnostic tests, therapies, and starting cancer treatment. Waiting times were already increasing before the pandemic. At their most recent lowest point, in March 2019, the RTT total stood at 8,985 patients waiting over 36 weeks. But those numbers increased again over following months to 25,549 in December 2019. Between February 2020 and February 2021, total numbers waiting to start treatment rose from 461,809 to 549,353, with those waiting over 36 weeks growing from 25,634 to 217,655 patients – a 749% increase. A fall in the numbers of patients being referred by GPs for treatment means there are fewer patients waiting under 36 weeks, but patients who were already on waiting lists are waiting longer. Around 60% of those waiting over 36 weeks are waiting for a first out-patient appointment.  46  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Performance against Referral to Treatment (RTT) waiting times targets: Wales, February 2020-February 2021  Source: StatsWales, NHS Wales Hospital Waiting Times Referral to treatment  There are also Welsh Government targets stating that no-one should wait longer than eight weeks for diagnostic services, such as X-Rays, or 14 weeks for therapy services, such as physiotherapy. Between February 2020 and February 2021, the numbers waiting beyond these targets rose from 3,551 to 48,136 in diagnostics, and from 197 to 4,129 in therapies.  47  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Percentage of patients waiting longer than diagnostic and therapy waiting times targets: Wales, February 2020-February 2021  Source: StatsWales, NHS Wales Hospital Waiting Times Diagnostic and Therapy Services  Where are the key pressures? The original decision to postpone non-urgent treatment applied across Wales. But since December 2020, health boards have been able to decide locally when and how much non-urgent work they could resume. Over time, this may mean the speed of dealing with the backlog varies across Wales. In December 2020, health boards were delivering only around half of the pre-pandemic levels of non-urgent activity.  48  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Numbers of Referral to Treatment (RTT) patients waiting over 36 weeks by health board, February 2020 and February 2021  Source: StatsWales, NHS Wales Hospital Waiting Times Referral to treatment  Much of the growth in waiting lists comes from high-volume procedures for specific conditions, such as hip and knee replacements, or cataracts. Of the 217,655 patients waiting over 36 weeks, the majority are in a small number of specialties, including 52,173 in orthopaedics, 31,695 in ophthalmology, 26,354 in ear, nose and throat, 25,181 in general surgery, and 12,715 in dermatology.  Is that the whole picture? The published figures tell only part of the story. GPs have made fewer referrals for treatment. Total monthly referrals fell from 109,432 in February 2020 to 39,076 in April 2020, and were only 82,647 in February 2021. The Fifth Senedd’s Health, Social Care and Sport (HSCS) Committee inquiry into the impact of COVID-19 on health and social care heard concerns around potential “pent-up demand”, including people with existing chronic conditions who needed ongoing support and assessment. Cardiff and the Vale UHB stated that:  49  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  For most services the lack of referrals is unlikely to reflect a change in the true health needs of the population - more likely the demand has simply been supressed by the pandemic. As the pandemic recedes it is reasonable to assume this demand will resurface. There are particular concerns around falling numbers of cancer referrals. Dr Richard Johnson of the Royal College of Surgeons told the Committee that “[t]here’s a massive unmet need in the community where patients haven’t come forward yet and haven’t been diagnosed”. Macmillan Cancer Support estimate that between March and November 2020, around 3,500 people could have missed a cancer diagnosis. A report from Community Health Councils in Wales looking at the experiences of patients on waiting lists during the pandemic, says that many people were reluctant to use health services, due partly to concerns around COVID-19 infection. The impact of waiting on patients can be enormous. Not only must people on waiting lists live with their condition for longer, they may find it getting worse. The HSCS Committee heard that patients may need extra support or ‘prehabilitation’ before being able to begin treatment, and people referred by GPs may need a greater level of diagnostic support. “The effect on patients waiting for surgery, even if it’s just planned surgery, is quite devastating both from a physical and a psychological point of view”, according to the Royal College of Surgeons.  How will the NHS in Wales deal with the backlog? The Chief Executive of NHS Wales has stressed that reducing waiting times needs major changes in patient care, “making sure that we don’t just revert to our traditional services”. The Welsh NHS Confederation also acknowledge the need to “radically rethink” the way healthcare is delivered, including:   substantially increased use of digital technologies in providing accessible care. Greater use of virtual GP and out-patient consultations is perhaps the most significant service change which emerged during the pandemic;   supporting patients as partners in managing their own care, with access to better information and advice on their health;  50  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd   more team working across primary care and hospitals, including more and better organised support for people with chronic conditions;   increased support for GPs and primary care, such as more direct GP access to diagnostic services; and   providing some services more regionally, with health boards working together in areas such as diagnostics and less complex, high-volume surgery.  What are the barriers to tackling waiting lists? The Committee heard from health boards and professional bodies about issues that must be addressed in tackling the backlog. These include the continuing impact of the pandemic on service demand and capacity, with hospitals needing to separate COVID and non-COVID treatment. There’s also a need for improved scaling up of innovation. The Wales Audit Office, alongside other evaluation work, has been critical of NHS Wales’ record in rolling out successful good practice; Staff need time to recover and recuperate, there needs to be an increase in the workforce, and access to more service capacity, in both the NHS and independent sector. This will all need additional funding.  What could the new Welsh Government do? The waiting times figures are daunting. The then Minister for Health and Social Services, Vaughan Gething, said on 24 February 2021 that he believed the recovery will take at least a full Senedd term. These pressures aren’t unique to Wales. The Nuffield Trust report that waiting lists in England are at their highest point since August 2007, and the NHS Confederation estimates that NHS England faces a “hidden waiting list” of nearly six million people who haven’t used health services or been referred. Public Health Scotland reported that, in December 2020, almost 40% (34,456) of patients had waited over 39 weeks for treatment, with lengthy waiting times for out-patient appointments as well. Recovering from the pandemic involves clearing the existing backlog, and keeping up with demand from new patients added to waiting lists. The previous Welsh  51  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Government recently published a recovery plan for health and social care. This proposed changes in outpatient services, with virtual appointments and direct GP access to tests becoming normal practice, to reduce referrals to hospital services. It also recognised the need for additional service capacity. NHS activity remains constrained by COVID-19 restrictions and the need to retain capacity to deal with further outbreaks. Waiting times were increasing before the pandemic. Radical action may be required by the new Welsh Government if it wants current waiting lists not just to stabilise, but to shrink.

Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  55  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Recovering f rom the “biggest economic challenge in living memory” The last year has been the toughest economic period of many people’s lives. What are the challenges and opportunities for securing economic recovery and reshaping the Welsh economy? Gareth Thomas The Welsh economy has faced unprecedented challenges since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the start of 2020, who would have foreseen that many key economic sectors would have closed for some or all of the past year? Or that the Welsh and UK governments would spend billions supporting businesses and workers through the most difficult period of many people’s lifetimes? The Fifth Senedd’s Economy, Infrastructure and Skills (EIS) Committee concluded that economic recovery will be the “biggest economic challenge in living memory”.  What’s the scale of the challenge? Key economic indicators show the impact of the pandemic on the Welsh economy. Welsh Gross Domestic Product decreased by 2.4% in the first quarter of 2020, and by 15.1% in the second quarter. The number of payrolled employees in Wales in February 2021 was 24,000 lower than at the start of the pandemic, with much of this decrease having come in the early months of the pandemic. However, the claimant count in January 2021 is almost double the level seen at the start of 2020. Some of this increase will be caused by changes to Universal Credit eligibility. The claimant count is the number of people receiving Jobseeker’s Allowance, or who receive Universal Credit and are required to look for work.  56  What’s next?

Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Over 460,000 jobs have been furloughed in Wales since the start of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, and there’s concern from the Resolution Foundation that unemployment will spike when it eventually ends. Monthly data has been available since July 2020, and the latest figures show that 13% of the workforce was furloughed at the end of February 2021.

It suggests that Welsh employment will recover over the next three years, but that Welsh Gross Value Added and productivity at the end of 2023 will still be lower than before the pandemic.  58  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Predicted percentage change in productivity, employment and GVA in Wales compared to Q4, 2019  Source: National Institute of Economic and Social Research, National Institute UK Economic Outlook February 2021  What are the challenges in supporting businesses to recover? Some key economic sectors have been required to close for some or all of the past year. Long-term support will be needed to help these sectors get back to full strength – the Federation of Small Businesses Wales has pointed to the particular needs of the tourism sector which is “facing three winters”. More detail is available in our article on hard-hit sectors. The recovery will also need to address underlying challenges. Wales has historically had a lower level of business start-ups than the UK average. Professor Dylan Jones-Evans has called for the new Welsh Government to focus more closely on entrepreneurship as there is “overwhelming evidence that new firms not only create the majority of new jobs in any economy but especially during a recession”.  59  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Wales has lower productivity than other parts of the UK, with output per hour being 17% below the UK average in 2018. Professor Andrew Henley believes that Wales has tended to see tackling low productivity as “too difficult a challenge to address”, and that “in the long run, productivity is really important, and so we have to look at how we’re going to address this challenge”. He highlights that spending on innovation and skills will be critical, particularly to support small businesses and microbusinesses.  What impacts on different groups will need to be addressed? The Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics found that previous recessions disproportionately impacted the youngest, the poorest, and ethnic minorities. This has also been the case during the pandemic. Young people in Wales were the most likely to work in a ‘shutdown sector’ before the pandemic, and also to be furloughed. There’s concern that we may see a ‘scarred generation’ that experiences long-term effects of youth unemployment. The Fifth Senedd’s EIS Committee called for the next Welsh Government to consider introducing a Youth Opportunity Guarantee for 16-24 year olds to help tackle youth unemployment. The Resolution Foundation found that low-paid workers are “more likely to have lost their job, or hours and pay, or to have been furloughed”. The Fair Work Commission, established by the previous Welsh Government, made wideranging recommendations to deliver fair work. However, the pandemic has added to the challenges many low-paid workers were already facing, and the Wales Trades Union Congress has outlined further ways that it believes the next Welsh Government should deliver fair work. Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna’s report for the previous Welsh Government outlined employment and income inequalities that ethnic minorities face. The Wales Centre for Public Policy has proposed actions to address these, including improving workplace representation and progression, tackling workplace discrimination, and addressing the ethnicity pay gap. The previous Welsh Government consulted on its draft Race Equality Action Plan, but it’s for the next government to decide how to take this forward.  60  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Redundancies in previous recessions have tended to be in sectors that mainly employ men. However, women represent 45% of those who have been made redundant since the start of the pandemic, compared to around a third of those made redundant following the 2008 recession. Women have also been more likely than men to work in a ‘shutdown sector’, and since July 2020 more women have been furloughed than men. Chwarae Teg has called for a feminist economic recovery, which recognises that care is as important as the production of goods.  What opportunities are there to change how the Welsh economy works? Professor Gillian Bristow and Dr Adrian Healy state that building a more diverse economy, place-based development and local ownership will build long-term resilience to future shocks. They say that addressing long-term challenges such as the wellbeing of future generations and shifting to a zero-carbon economy would also build resilience. There’s consensus around the need for a ‘green recovery’, but different views on what this means in practice. The Confederation of British Industry Wales has called for green infrastructure investment to be prioritised through retrofitting homes and developing electric vehicle charging networks. RSPB Cymru believes that a green recovery should support the natural environment to recover and resources to be managed sustainably. The Future Generations Commissioner has highlighted the importance of focusing widely across a number of areas and investing in skills for new green jobs. The previous Welsh Government sought to use the foundational economy to “build resilience in our local economies, to create better jobs closer to home and to build stronger local businesses”. But barriers will need to be removed to achieve this – such as reforming procurement, and addressing low pay and insecure working conditions. It’s clear that there are significant short and long-term challenges facing the Welsh economy, and that these will be particularly acute in some sectors. However, there are also undoubted opportunities to improve the way that the economy works for all.  61  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  There are also a number of questions to which answers will emerge over coming years. What impact will greater remote working have on commuting and work patterns, and how will this affect our town and city centres? What does the future hold in terms of automation and artificial intelligence, and how might these impact on productivity and jobs? The next Welsh Government will need to respond to developments in these areas as well as securing economic recovery.

Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Supporting the recovery of hard-hit sectors The economic impacts of the pandemic have not been shared equally across all parts of the economy. With many sectors still facing significant challenges, what can the new Welsh Government do to support them? Ben Stokes The restrictions needed to curb the spread of COVID-19 have forced changes to the way we live, work, socialise and spend our free time. With huge numbers of businesses forced to close for long periods and others facing significant loss of trade, government has stepped in to furlough staff and attempt to support whole sections of the economy in a way never seen before. But while this level of government support has no doubt had a significant positive effect in safeguarding jobs, the effects of the past year and the potential need for continued restrictions on some activities are likely to have a combined impact that will be felt for years to come. And just like the health impacts of COVID-19 have affected different groups of people in different ways, the economic impacts have not been shared equally across all sectors.  Which sectors have been hit hardest by the pandemic? Some of the hardest hit sectors are those that depend on members of the public mixing together, indoors, in close proximity. All of which are activities that have been either severely restricted or prohibited in law for much of the past year. For example, the effects of these restrictions have fallen heavily on businesses and organisations in the culture sector (such as theatres and live music venues) and those in the non-essential retail, hospitality, leisure and tourism (NERHLT) sectors. During lockdowns Welsh retailers have been losing £100 million a week in sales. While overall, last year saw the worst ever retail sales figures with shopper footfall decreasing by over 50%. In 2020 the hospitality sector suffered a drop in sales of over 50% across the UK. The latest available figures for Wales show economic output in the ‘accommodation and food service activities’ sector fell by 76.3% in Quarter 2 (April to June) 2020 compared to the previous quarter.  63  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Recent research found that around a quarter of businesses in the tourism sector in Wales lost over 80% of their normal revenue in 2020, while over half of the businesses in the sector have seen revenues fall by more than 60%. Highlighting the immense challenges faced by the sector, the research reports that only 43% of tourism businesses expect to survive for longer than the next six months. Since March 2020, artistic performances with an audience have been prohibited in Wales. This is in contrast to England and many other European nations who have, at times, allowed performances to take place. Along with restrictions that have struck at the heart of the way many cultural activities usually operate, UK Government employment support schemes have often not reflected the employment structure of the sector. Around half of the 80,000 creative workers in Wales are freelancers and at times these individuals have fallen through the gaps in support. A point recognised by the previous Welsh Government via the establishment of a Freelancer Fund.  How did the last Welsh Government support these sectors? Since the start of the pandemic the Welsh Government has put together a support package for businesses worth more than £2 billion. This is on top of the vast sums that have come from the UK Government direct to businesses and individuals in Wales via the furlough and self-employment income support schemes. Towards the end of the Fifth Senedd the previous Welsh Government’s specific support for NERHLT businesses and those in the supply chain, centred on successive rounds of grants to help businesses that had closed or been materially impacted as a result of lockdown restrictions. In March 2021, the previous Welsh Government also announced an extension to the existing business rates holiday for the retail, leisure and hospitality sector so that more than 70,000 businesses in those sectors will continue to pay no rates at all in 2021-22. In July 2020, the previous Welsh Government announced the creation of a Cultural Recovery Fund to provide essential support to the sector. By November 2020 over £63 million had been allocated to the Fund. And by March 2021 the Freelancer Fund had provided £18 million of support to 3,500 creative sector freelancers.  64  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  In March 2021, the Fifth Senedd’s Culture, Welsh Language and Communications (CWLC) Committee heard that the Welsh Government was “hoping to receive £24 million in consequential funding” following the UK Government’s announcement of additional support for theatres, museums and other cultural organisations in England. The Committee also heard from Welsh Government officials that the additional funding announced by the UK Government “follows the road map” that it has set out for emerging from the current lockdown in England. This raises an important question, that also applies to other sectors. That is, if the new Welsh Government follows a slightly different road map out of lockdown to that of the UK Government, and chooses to re-open some sectors at a different pace to England, how will this affect the level of financial support they will be able to provide?  Early decisions needed f rom the new Welsh Government After considering what Welsh Government action will be needed to support economic recovery, the Fifth Senedd’s Economy, Infrastructure and Skills (EIS) Committee concluded that businesses which have felt the worst effects of the pandemic will need a “stronger and longer pandemic exit strategy than the rest of the economy”. Similarly the Welsh Retail Consortium has stressed that the new Welsh Government “will need to make brave and bold choices” to help the retail sector “weather the storm”. In policy terms, phrases like ‘brave and bold’ and ‘stronger and longer’ usually translate in practice to mean one thing: ‘expensive’. Other sectors, such as aerospace, manufacturing and steel, will no doubt also be looking for the new Welsh Government to bring forward interventions in the coming year that could be described in a similar way. The new Welsh Government will have difficult choices to make in terms of where it prioritises any future support. The previous Welsh Government took 18 months after the last election before it set out its new approach to business support. The new Welsh Government however won’t have the same luxury of time. It will need to make these decisions very early on - pretty much on day one of taking office.  65  What’s next?

Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Poverty and supporting low-income households Before the pandemic almost a quarter of people in Wales lived in poverty. The past year has hit the poorest the hardest, so how can the next Welsh Government address this? Gareth Thomas Tackling poverty has been a perennial challenge for successive Welsh Governments, and will continue to be with the pandemic having exacerbated existing inequalities. The Fifth Senedd’s Equality, Local Government and Communities (ELGC) Committee concluded that during the pandemic poverty has been a key factor in determining how likely people are to lose their jobs or income, fall behind in their education, and even how likely they are to die from COVID-19.. The Institute for Fiscal Studies warned that the slowdown in the economy will “undoubtedly have a large negative impact on household incomes over the coming years” as workers lose their jobs, and earnings fall.  What is poverty? A person is considered to be in poverty if their household income falls below 60% of the UK median (which is the middle value in a list of numbers that have been arranged from smallest to largest). The median weekly household income in the UK is £476 after housing costs, and 60% of this is around £286.  Poverty trends before the pandemic Poverty has remained stubbornly high over recent years, with Wales having the highest poverty rate of the UK nations prior to the pandemic. Children are more likely than other age groups to be in poverty, with 31% living in poverty – the only age group to see an increase in the latest figures. Chwarae Teg noted that women and single parents are also more likely to be in poverty.  67  What’s next?

People working full-time in every Welsh local authority had median weekly pay lower than the UK average.  68  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Median gross weekly earnings for full-time workers by workplace, April 2020  Source: Office for National Statistics, Employee Earnings in the UK: 2020  At the start of the pandemic, 22% of those working in Wales earned less per hour than the ‘real’ Living Wage with part-time workers and women particularly likely to do so. Many workers in key sectors such as social care and food retail earn less than the Living Wage, with the Resolution Foundation highlighting that this is the case for over half of frontline care workers.  The impact of the pandemic on low-income households People from low-income households have been most likely to lose their jobs, lose income or to be furloughed since the start of the pandemic. The Resolution Foundation found that over 40% of the lowest earners had been affected in these ways, double the percentage of the highest earners. The Bevan Foundation highlighted that a quarter of Welsh households have seen their income fall during the pandemic, while at the same time living costs have increased for more than four in ten households.  69  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Consequently, the number of people claiming social security benefits which support those on low incomes has increased considerably. In February 2021 over 125,000 more people in Wales were claiming Universal Credit than at the start of the pandemic, with much of this increase happening between March and May 2020. The UK Government has temporarily increased Universal Credit by £20 per week until the end of September 2021, however it is unclear what will happen after this. Number of people claiming Universal Credit in Wales, January 2020 to March 2021  Source: Department for Work and Pensions, Stat-Xplore Universal Credit data tables  There have been almost 160,000 COVID-related payments through the Welsh Government’s Discretionary Assistance Fund since the start of the pandemic. The number of payments was at its highest in February 2021 – mainly due to people stopping or reducing work, delays to benefit claims or increased costs of living. Given that the fund has been considerably scaled up, the next Welsh Government will need to consider its future role.  70  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Debt is likely to become a bigger problem in the coming months, as support schemes and eviction bans come to an end. Citizens Advice Cymru estimated that people in Wales have built up £73 million worth of household bill arrears during the pandemic, with the largest sources of arrears being rent and council tax. The Bevan Foundation found that low income households have been most likely to borrow during the pandemic, with over a quarter of the poorest households having borrowed from friends and family or gone into their overdraft. The Bevan Foundation also found that more than a quarter of low income households have responded to difficult financial circumstances by cutting back on spending on food for adults. Food banks and the Welsh Government have stepped in to provide additional food to people shielding and those in need. However, with many poorer households expecting to have to make further cutbacks in future the next Welsh Government will need to consider what action to take to support them.  What can be done to reduce poverty within the devolution settlement? While Council Tax Benefit and the Discretionary Assistance Fund were devolved to Wales as part of UK Government welfare reforms, social security is predominantly non-devolved, with decisions being taken by the UK Government. Similarly, employment law is not devolved meaning that there are limits to the levers the Welsh Government can use to reduce poverty. The Fifth Senedd’s ELGC Committee recommended that the Welsh Government should seek full devolution of Discretionary Housing Payments and explore the possibility of devolving other benefits, along with powers to top-up reserved benefits and create new ones. A range of Welsh Government schemes operate alongside the social security system to provide assistance to people on low incomes. The Bevan Foundation and Joseph Rowntree Foundation have both called for the next Welsh Government to enhance these schemes to create a ‘Welsh Benefits System’. This would provide a single point of access for people on low incomes, and prioritise help with housing and education costs and emergency support. To improve the economic position of those in low-paid work, the next Welsh Government will need to consider how the Fair Work Commission’s recommendations fit into its overall approach, and how it wishes to respond to issues facing low-paid workers that emerged during the pandemic.  71  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  The previous Welsh Government introduced an Economic Contract with fair work as one of its requirements for businesses seeking investment, which the Wales TUC believes should be strengthened. FSB Wales has called for the next government to start a business-led campaign to help firms understand how fair work can operate alongside growing a business. The previous Welsh Government also published a draft Social Partnership and Public Procurement Bill, which would require the Welsh Government to set and achieve fair work objectives, and seek to use procurement to promote fair work and well-being. To seek to deliver better outcomes for people on lower incomes, the previous Welsh Government introduced the Socio-Economic Duty from 31 March 2021. This requires public bodies covered by the duty to consider how their strategic decisions can help to reduce socio-economic inequalities by understanding potential impacts, and consulting with those impacted by decisions. While it is difficult to assess the impact of equality duties, this new tool has the potential to change how public bodies make decisions. The key question for the next Welsh Government will be how effectively it can use these levers to help address widening inequalities resulting from the pandemic, while operating in the context of wider UK Government policy.

Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  75  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Homelessness: f rom crisis to opportunity Has the pandemic given Wales a chance to end homelessness? Megan Jones and Jonathan Baxter Homelessness and rough sleeping were already high on the political agenda in the Fifth Senedd. There was new legislation with more focus on prevention, a Senedd committee inquiry into rough sleeping, a new homelessness strategy from the Welsh Government and Crisis published its plan to end homelessness. By 2019, an expert Homelessness Action Group was advising the government and a review was commissioned of the ‘priority need’ test that determines how much help a person who is homeless gets. A campaign for a legal right to adequate housing was up and running. The direction of travel was clear. But it’s the public health emergency that has speeded up the journey.  Doing things differently £10 million of Welsh Government funding in March 2020 kickstarted the emergency response to homelessness during the pandemic. New statutory guidance to local authorities said people should get temporary accommodation if they needed it, and the additional funding ensured this happened. The new guidance was clear that local authorities should do all they could “to ensure no one is sleeping rough”. In effect, the guidance was removing legal barriers that had previously restricted who had the right to get help. The then Minister, Julie James, was clear that no one should be without suitable accommodation and support.  Somewhere to ‘stay safe’ By June 2020, over 2,000 people had been moved into emergency temporary accommodation. In addition to people who would have been considered a priority before the pandemic, like families with children, other groups were given shelter. So people sleeping rough or living in unsuitable, unsafe, insecure accommodation were offered a temporary home and support. Gone was the offer of a floor to sleep on in a night shelter or a shared room in a hostel. Having to ‘sofa surf’ was no longer the best people could hope for.  76  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Local authorities worked with housing associations, third sector organisations and private landlords to help people into accommodation and to provide the support services they needed. Working with new partners, local authorities secured selfcontained accommodation in hotels, holiday lets and student accommodation – accommodation that would otherwise be closed commercially because of the COVID-19 restrictions. The initial effort to save lives appears to have paid off. Up to 26 June 2020, the Office for National Statistics found there were no deaths registered in Wales from COVID-19 of people who were identified as homeless. But re-housing so many people has created huge pressures on temporary accommodation. At the end of February 2021, just over 6,000 homeless people (including nearly 1,300 dependent children under 16) were living in temporary accommodation.  77  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Homelessness: Individuals in temporary accommodation at the end of each month, individuals moved into suitable long-term accommodation during the month and people placed into temporary accommodation during the month  Source: Welsh Government, Homelessness accommodation provision and rough sleeping. The data has not undergone the same level of quality assurance as official statistics and may be revised in future.  A long-term solution Homelessness isn’t just about housing. But increasing the supply of affordable housing is vital to easing pressures on temporary accommodation and to preventing homelessness in the first place. Additional affordable homes are needed, including more social rented homes. Homes of the right size and in the right place. Smaller homes for the many single people experiencing homeless, along with larger homes needed for extended families. And more homes are needed that better meet the needs of disabled people.  78  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  What is rapid rehousing? Moving people into settled, secure and suitable homes as quickly as possibly as the default solution when homelessness cannot be prevented.  Increasing the supply of affordable housing will take a range of national, regional and local solutions that address the specific needs of communities. Solutions that can help rural communities where few new homes are built and where there may be local pressures from the numbers of second homes. And community led solutions, like co-operative models, that can work in both rural and urban contexts.  The pandemic may have presented an opportunity to end homelessness and to put housing at the centre of the recovery. A recovery that delivers modern, energy efficient low-carbon affordable homes, improves existing homes in the public and private sector and brings empty homes back into use. And all this has the potential to provide not just homes, but jobs and training opportunities.  What does ending homelessness look like? The previous Welsh Government established an expert group in 2019 to answer this question. The Homelessness Action Group engaged with the sector, support providers, academics and people with lived experience of homelessness. The Action Group’s second and main report set a framework of policies, approaches and plans with the aim of ending homelessness. It’s clear the group’s work has shaped the response to the pandemic. By July 2020 an extra £50 million had been made available by the Welsh Government to support phase 2 of the homelessness response and the transformation of services. The aim was to move away from a reliance on unsuitable temporary accommodation and towards a rapid rehousing approach as called for by the Action Group. Highlighting the links between homelessness and wider social issues, the Action Group’s recommendations call for universal prevention. This is based on the idea that homelessness isn’t a stand-alone issue and that factors like poverty and a wide range of adverse childhood experiences need to be addressed to “lay the foundations for ending homelessness”.  79  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  It calls for prevention to be targeted at certain groups proven to be at greater risk, such as vulnerable young people and people leaving care or prison. It also wants the legal duty to prevent homelessness to be extended across the wider public sector, not just placed at the door of housing services. In the third and final report, the Action Group sets out practical recommendations aimed at putting ‘rapid rehousing’ at the heart of the system for tackling homelessness, building on the pandemic response. It also focuses on partnerships needed across public services to end homelessness in a strategic, planned way and the impact of UK policy, like welfare reform.  New challenges The Homelessness Action Group has set out the steps it sees as necessary to end homelessness. Will the new Welsh Government seek to implement those recommendations through an action plan, or will it put forward alternative proposals? Can the new government build on the achievements of the last year? The next few months will present some major new challenges in this policy area:   Will there be a surge in demand placed on homelessness services when the current suspension of evictions is lifted?   Will the full economic impact of the pandemic result in more job losses and homelessness?   How will local authorities manage the growing pressure on temporary accommodation?   Will there need to be a return to the pre-pandemic approach of rationing access to temporary accommodation? It’s widely recognised that homelessness and inadequate housing directly impacts on inequalities, health, education and the life chances of current and future generations. The challenge for the next Welsh Government is to provide the leadership that the Homelessness Action Group says is essential to deliver the homes, homelessness prevention and support services that are needed.  80  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  The previous Welsh Government said homelessness should be “rare, brief and un-repeated”. This pandemic appears to have provided the best opportunity to make that aspiration a reality. The big question is whether it can actually be achieved during the Sixth Senedd.

Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Putting the ‘public’ back into public transport Bus and rail services are having a tough time in the pandemic. How can Welsh transport policy put them back on their feet and why does it matter? Andrew Minnis The performance of bus and rail services has been a concern for years. However, the pandemic has seen a collapse in passenger numbers and revenue. Both modes have been on life support since last March. Recovery of the sector will be important if Wales is to achieve some key socioeconomic and environmental priorities. Yet future demand, and even the postpandemic purpose of these transport modes, is unclear. An effective response from policy makers and practitioners in the Sixth Senedd will be crucial to get public transport back on the road (and rails) to recovery.  What’s happened to passenger numbers? Public transport issues are not new. Bus passenger numbers have declined for about a decade. In contrast, rail passengers have grown steadily, but overcrowding and aging trains have dogged Arriva Trains Wales, and subsequently Transport for Wales (TfW) Rail.  82  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Passenger journeys on local bus services index April-June 2010 to October – December 2020  Source: Quarterly bus statistics, UK Department for Transport  Rail passenger journeys index for Transport for Wales and Great Britain AprilJune 2011 to October – December 2020  Source: Passenger rail usage, Office of Rail and Road  The pandemic’s impact has been shattering. Bus and rail passenger numbers have collapsed. The Welsh Government has estimated that the use of public transport declined by 95% in the early days of the pandemic compared to the same period the year before. Given the impact on congestion and the environment, it’s also concerning that car usage, for Great Britain as a whole, has recovered much more rapidly than bus  83  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  and rail – a fact attributed by RAC research partly to safety concerns and lack of adequate alternatives. Estimated use of transport modes in Great Britain since March 2020  Source: Transport use during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, UK Department for Transport Note: The UK Department for Transport published a note on methodology for this data outlining its limitations. Baselines differ for each mode.  Why does public transport matter? Public transport helps address key socio-economic issues like social inclusion and access to work. A quarter of households lack car access and the Bevan Foundation has highlighted public transport’s role in supporting social inclusion including for older people and those on low incomes. Evidence to the Senedd’s Petitions Committee said one in five job offers at Deeside Industrial Park are turned down because of poor public transport or road congestion. Public transport has environmental benefits. Road transport is a significant cause of air pollution and poor air quality, so low emission buses and rail  84  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  services can improve air quality. In terms of climate change, the UK Climate Change Committee highlights, in its latest advice report to the Welsh Government, that surface transport more generally contributes 14% of Welsh greenhouse gas emissions, higher per capita than for the UK as a whole. The CCC identifies public transport and active travel as priorities for Welsh decarbonisation.  Public transport on life support The last Welsh Government responded to the collapse in passenger numbers by immediately putting bus and TfW Rail services on life support, with an initial round of emergency financial support in March 2020. Further support for rail followed last May before the Welsh Government announced in the autumn that TfW would take rail services into public ownership as “operator of last resort”. A move expected to last at least five years. Initial support for bus services merged with wider reform priorities to become a new Bus Emergency Scheme. Bus reform With plans for a Bus Services Bill shelved due to the pandemic, the last Welsh Government introduced the Bus Emergency Scheme, combining emergency funding with an increased role for local government and TfW in planning networks. The previous Welsh Government anticipated this increased role for government would endure, and also continued to develop legislation for its successor to consider. In contrast bus operators anticipate a return to a “commercial” network, less dependent on public funding, and view legislation as unnecessary. Together, both modes received about £200 million of additional Welsh Government funding in 2020-21, with more to come in 2021-22.  What’s the plan for recovery? Many countries and cities are focusing transport recovery on sustainable mobility, including public transport. In Wales, and more widely in Great Britain, NGOs like Transport Focus, the Campaign for Better Transport and Transform Cymru have published post-COVID-19 priorities supporting this approach.  85  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  The previous Welsh Government published a new Wales Transport Strategy in March which reflects its wider post-COVID-19 reconstruction priorities. The strategy prioritises reducing the need to travel, along with a shift from the private car to more sustainable modes. Significantly, it includes a target to increase the share of journeys by public transport and active travel from 32% to 45% by 2040. Along with bus reform, the success of the three planned Metro systems will be crucial to public transport recovery, as will plans to address M4 congestion around Newport and new transport governance arrangements. The future of the M4 corridor around Newport The Burns Commission published final recommendations on alternatives to the M4 relief road last November, focusing on public transport. Though accepted by the last Welsh Government, these require investment in nondevolved rail infrastructure. The UK Government has announced funding for exploratory work on Lord Burns’ rail recommendations. However, the Prime Minister supports a relief road, and the Secretary of State has described it as “the most obvious” solution to congestion.  Transport governance Corporate Joint Committees (CJCs) are being established to deliver some Welsh local government functions regionally, including transport planning. The last Welsh Government saw its transport body, TfW, as a “go-to” delivery body for these CJCs. Yet local government has not always been clear on the relationship between TfW and proposed regional transport structures. This relationship will be crucial to achieving the aims of the new transport strategy and public transport recovery.  86  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  However, not all policy levers currently sit within Wales. In particular, UK Government plans to reform rail in Great Britain could have big implications for Wales. Rail reform While the Welsh Government has executive powers, rail is largely reserved. The UK Government has overall control of the rail system, including Welsh rail infrastructure outside the Core Valleys Network. The last Welsh Government believed Wales has been short changed on rail infrastructure enhancement spending, and developed a strategic case for investment. The UK Government announced a “root and branch” rail review in 2018 and in September last year the Secretary of State said a White Paper on the future of rail in Great Britain was on its way within 18 months.  A new purpose for public transport? Once the crisis point has passed, the question of what post-pandemic public transport will look like will remain. The previous Welsh Government highlighted uncertainty around the pandemic’s impact on future travel demand. Public opinion surveys and work by Transport Focus suggest a long-term change in travel habits and demand, not least if remote working becomes more established as the previous Welsh Government intended. The next Welsh Government’s transport policy will need to ensure bus and rail services are able to adapt to their new purpose, if the ambitious targets in the new transport strategy are to be retained and met. In doing so, it will also need to address perennial issues like integration with other modes, coordinating with trip generating policy areas like health and land-use planning, addressing congestion and managing demand. The new Welsh Government will have its work cut out.  87  What’s next?

Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Is a million Welsh speakers by 2050 achievable? With an ambitious target to almost double the number of Welsh speakers within a generation, is action translating into results? Osian Bowyer At the start of the Fifth Senedd, the previous Welsh Government took the bold step of announcing the ambitious goal of a million Welsh speakers by 2050. Looking to almost double the number of Welsh speakers in Wales, it marked a dramatic shift in policy direction.  Cymraeg 2050 – a strategy for a generation Cymraeg 2050 – A million Welsh speakers is a strategy that spans a generation, and has three key themes:   increasing the number of Welsh speakers;  increasing use of Welsh; and  creating suitable conditions and an environment where the Welsh language and its speakers can thrive. The Fifth Senedd’s Culture, Welsh Language and Communications (CWLC) Committee found widespread support for the 2050 target and the aims within the strategy to achieve it. It noted that for the strategy to succeed, “considerable additional resources and clear targets” would be needed.  Are the numbers heading in the right direction? The previous Welsh Government didn’t shy away from the central role the education system would play in creating the bulk of new Welsh speakers. After all, the Welsh Language Use Survey 2013-15 found that 4 out of 5 children aged 3 to 15 mainly learnt Welsh at school or nursery.  89  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  The strategy set challenging targets for the long and short-term. These include increasing the proportion of learners in Welsh-medium education and increasing the number of teachers able to teach through the medium of Welsh. The data shows limited progress to date – while the number of secondary school teachers able to teach in Welsh remained broadly consistent between 2016 and 2020, the number of primary school teachers able to teach in Welsh has declined slightly. Number of teachers able to teach through the medium of Welsh (primary and secondary school)  Source: Welsh Language Strategy: annual report 2019 to 2020 and Cymraeg 2050: A million Welsh speakers  90  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Percentage of Year 2 learners (seven years old) assessed in Welsh as a first language or who learn Welsh as a first language (School Census data – PLASC)  Source: Welsh Language Strategy: annual report 2019 to 2020 and Cymraeg 2050: A million Welsh speakers  There’s been better progress on the goal to create 40 new Cylchoedd Meithrin (Welsh-medium playgroups) by 2021. The previous Welsh language Minister, Eluned Morgan, said in February 2021 that “by the end of this year [2021], we hope to have established 46 [Cylchoedd Meithrin], so we will have exceeded that target”. Side-by-side with the increase in the number of Cylchoedd Meithrin is an increase in the number of children attending them – 10,724 in 2015-16 and 11,544 in 2019-20. There’s also a positive trend in the percentage of children moving from early-years settings into Welsh-medium primary schools (86% 2015-16 to 90% 2018-19). These are small gains however, and won’t by themselves achieve the inroads Cymraeg 2050 seeks to make. At the other end of the educational spectrum, the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol (the Coleg Cymraeg) has rapidly built-up Welsh-medium provision within universities, providing more opportunities for students to study in Welsh. It now seeks to do the same in the post-16 sector. The Coleg Cymraeg notes in its Further Education and Apprenticeship Welsh-medium Action Plan that this sector “has not had the same strategic focus or investment compared with, for example, the Higher Education sector”.  91  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Following calls for investment to develop post-16 Welsh-medium provision, the previous Welsh Government provided the Coleg Cymraeg with an additional £800,000 for 2021-22. Future investment will likely be required if Cymraeg 2050 targets are to be met.  What about day-to-day use of Welsh? Cymraeg 2050 sets out to double the percentage of people that speak Welsh on a daily basis from 10% (Welsh Language Use Survey 2013-15 data) to 20% by 2050. Increasing usage could be far more influential to language growth than the numbers that speak it. For a language to thrive, it must be used on a regular basis – whether that is in the home, the office, in the local shop, or with friends in the pub. Providing spaces and opportunities for people to use Welsh, particularly within their local area and workplace is central to its viability and growth. Helping the network of organisations that support and promote the language within communities has never been more critical. The pandemic has had a significant impact on the work of this network. The effects of COVID-19 on Welsh language community groups survey found that the vast majority (68%) of regular activities had ceased after the first lockdown was announced in March 2020. Some adapted their activities to digital formats, providing opportunities to engage differently with participants, and reach out to a wider audience.  Supporting the language to grow? Various interventions, resources and innovations are needed to help those learning the language and encourage its daily use. These can range from policies that support jobs growth in Welsh speaking communities to the development of the translation profession. The previous Welsh Government’s Welsh Language Technology Action Plan supports innovative technology developments to assist and enable people to live their lives through the medium of Welsh. There’s also been investment in developing artificial intelligence to allow Welsh to be used with ‘bots’, for example. The hope is that in future, Welsh speakers will be able to use Welsh with their voice assistants, such as Siri and Alexa. In March 2021, the previous Welsh Government launched a consultation on a National policy on Welsh linguistic infrastructure. The proposals seek to coordinate and make it easier for people to use Welsh language resources. This  92  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  may include developing dictionaries and terminology, or creating a central portal to access them. How that’s taken forward will very much depend on the new Welsh Government.  Will mainstreaming the language help? For Cymraeg 2050 to succeed, it will require the new Welsh Government to embed the Welsh language across all policy portfolios. One criticism consistently raised during the Fifth Senedd was that the Welsh Government’s Welsh Language Unit lacks ‘clout’ within the civil service. The Fifth Senedd’s CWLC Committee inquiry on Supporting and Promoting the Language recommended that: The Welsh Government should move to enhance the status and role of the Welsh Language Unit... The Unit should also have an increased cross-governmental role, ensuring internal arrangements for effective implementation of Cymraeg 2050 is undertaken across government departments. There’s also debate as to where national oversight of Welsh language policy should sit within the Welsh Government. As the previous Minister noted during scrutiny: I would suggest that actually, rather than just holding me to account when it comes to the budget… that actually you ask the other Ministers, who’ve got huge amounts of money, what they’re doing within their budgets in relation to the Welsh language. The Welsh Language Budget that specifically supports and promotes the language is currently a modest £38 million, dwarfed in comparison to other departmental budgets. Cymdeithas yr Iaith has long called for the Welsh Government to commit 1% of its total budget to promote the language. The figure for 2021-22 stands at 0.19%.  All eyes turn to the 2021 Census! Language planning is complex. It requires systematic and innovative approaches, resources and most importantly, harnessing the continued support of the people of Wales. All eyes will soon turn to the Census 2021, which is considered the authoritative source of data on the number of Welsh speakers in Wales. The Census is the yardstick that will be used to establish progress on Cymraeg 2050 targets over the next few decades. Along with data from the Welsh Language Use Survey, the  93  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  National Survey for Wales and the Annual Population Survey, it will provide the next Welsh Government with critical data on the health of the language. If the Census 2021 data shows an increase in the number of Welsh speakers, it will provide some vindication for the ambition and targets set in Cymraeg 2050. A decrease will only intensify pressure on the next Welsh Government to consider a different approach.

Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Back to school: education in the time of COVID Even before pupils’ coats are back on their school pegs, the pressure is already on the education system to deliver significantly more. Concerns that we don’t stigmatise children mean that talk about a ‘lost generation’ needing to ’catchup’ is already out of favour. Yet the inescapable reality is that months of face to face learning have been missed. Our learners have been part of the pandemic’s “collateral damage” While at this stage there are more questions than answers, the solutions will need to be carefully considered and delivered during the Sixth Senedd. Siân Thomas  The state of play pre-pandemic Arguably, Wales was already facing an uphill struggle to secure good educational outcomes for all its learners. A decade after the then Welsh Government recognised that the education system had showed “evidence of systemic failure”, there was a collective holding of breath when Wales’ 2018 PISA results were announced. Following extra funding and a national action plan to deliver change, the 2018 PISA scores were seen as a much needed sign of some progress. Wales’ scores were no longer statistically significantly different to the OECD average in each of three main domains (reading, mathematics and science), although they remained the lowest of the UK nations. Then Education Minister, Kirsty Williams, described them as “positive, not perfect”.  98  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  How did Wales perform in PISA 2018?  Source: National Foundation for Educational Research, Achievement of 15-Year Olds in Wales: PISA 2018 National Report (2019)  The most disadvantaged learners have extra challenges which can prevent them from achieving their full potential. Even though the previous Welsh Government invested £585 million since 2012 through the Pupil Development Grant (PDG ), the attainment gap it was seeking to close didn’t narrow. It also typically widens as learners get older. There’s a stark difference between children eligible for free school meals and their peers at Key Stage 4, the two years where learners usually take GCSEs and other examinations.  99  What’s next?

A 2021 Children’s Commissioner survey of 20,000 children found that 35% didn’t feel confident about their learning, compared to 25% in May 2020. 63% of 12-18 year olds were worried about falling behind. There are countless reports setting out adults’ views about how missing more than half a year of ‘face to face’ schooling has affected learners. One of the major concerns has been the variation between what schools have been delivering to pupils. There’s a long list of potential impacts:   ‘lost learning’ meaning pupils could underperform academically and have their long term prospects affected;   a loss of confidence in the examination and assessment system;  100  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd   long term reductions in school attendance, a factor which we know is key to educational outcomes;   difficult transitions between school years and from primary to secondary;  challenges in re-engaging learners and addressing low motivation;  an unhelpful ‘catch up’ narrative about lost learning placing unnecessary psychological pressure on children and young people; and   a negative effect on learners’ ability and confidence to communicate in Welsh where they haven’t been able to do so at home. As well as these obvious educational issues there are wider predicted effects. Current learners could earn less, with one estimate of up to £40,000 in a lifetime. The harm to children’s physical health and a higher prevalence of mental health issues, including anxiety and depression, are also serious concerns. The pandemic’s wider economic impact is also likely to increase the number of children living in low income families. Again, it’s the most disadvantaged learners who are predicted to bear the brunt in the longer term. For example, in March 2021, the Child Poverty Action Group found that 35% of low-income families responding to its UK wide survey were still without essential resources for learning, with laptops and devices most commonly missing. The Fifth Senedd’s Children, Young People and Education (CYPE) Committee heard that there is “plenty of evidence” that ”there are striking differences between families in terms of their ability to support young people in their learning: the resources they have around them, the enthusiasm, the engagement, the commitment”. There may also be work to be done to rebuild relationships which have been under significant strain during the past 12 months. Those between teaching unions and the decision-makers within the education system; between parents/carers and schools; and perhaps, most importantly, re-establishing the relationship between learners and their teachers.  Immediate and longer term solutions? Some of the immediate solutions which are already on the table or up for discussion are: more money, including the ‘Recruit, Recover and Raise Standards funding’; more teachers and learning assistants on the ground; changing term times; and setting up summer schools, holiday clubs and home tuition.  101  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  However, in the longer term, there may be more questions than answers about the way forward, such as:   How to ditch the ‘deficit model’? Placing the onus on the education system to support learners rather than pressurising learners to catch up.   Whether a long term is strategy needed to coordinate the range of possible solutions? What’s the future role of schools, local authorities, regional consortia and the Welsh Government in this? Who should be in charge of this long term approach? Should Wales should appoint an Education Tsar, as in England?   Are schools being properly funded? One estimate places the cost of Wales’ journey back from COVID-19 at £1.4 billion.   Can international examples and historical experiences help identify ways of dealing with such major interruptions to education? One academic has already suggested that “disruption can lead to positive change if you’re willing to make the effort”.   To what extent is the current education system fit for purpose? Is now the ‘watershed moment’ and time for a complete rethink?  Major reforms to deliver: mental health, the curriculum and additional learning needs Children and young people’s return to the classroom has been heralded as the big chance to put their well-being at the heart of education. As well as having a positive impact on well-being, put simply, mentally healthy children are much more likely to learn. Following pressure from the Fifth Senedd’s CYPE Committee and its stakeholders, Wales has already made a significant shift towards establishing a ‘Whole School Approach to Mental Health’. The challenge during the Sixth Senedd will be to deliver it. The potential sting in the tail is that, at the exact same time the education system is getting children back to school, it also has to contend with major legislative reform. This is in the form of wholesale changes to both the school curriculum and support for learners with Additional Learning Needs.  102  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Some may argue that there’s been no better time to have such significant changes. If the education system can successfully implement these three major reforms then arguably Wales has done some significant leg work to be on a firmer footing to meet the challenges that COVID-19 has presented.  More questions than answers? At this stage there may be many more questions than answers for the education system. The world into which learners will move has changed forever. Not only has the pandemic interrupted their schooling, but the future journeys they were expected to make into the workplace or further and higher education may be unrecognisable. The skills and aptitudes needed in the ‘new normal’ are only now beginning to be identified and are likely to be different from those needed before the pandemic began. COVID-19 has made its unforgettable mark on the world. Perhaps the biggest question of all is how radical the response of Wales’ education system should be.

Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Skills: a road to prosperity Skills are critical to making Wales a more prosperous nation. But raising qualification levels in the population is not enough. There are other challenges that must be overcome, such as stimulating employer demand for higher level skills. Phil Boshier Skills are a key factor in improving productivity and pay, both of which drive economic growth and higher living standards. Since 2008, qualification levels among the working age population in Wales have risen substantially Yet, Wales - like the UK - is in the midst of an entrenched productivity problem, with parts of the nation trapped in “a cycle of low-skill, low-wage and lowproductivity”. ‘Sluggish’ productivity alongside increasing qualification levels shows that any relationship between skills and prosperity is not a simple one. Some of the challenges that will face the new Welsh Government include the need to consider employer demand for skills, getting the content of qualifications right, and the take-up and provision of lifelong learning.  Qualif ication levels may outstrip employer demand for them The supply of qualifications into the labour market is likely to carry on growing, but demand for high level skills from employers may not keep pace. One study projects that: The supply of highly qualified people will grow more quickly than demand for such qualifications. This is already happening in Wales where qualifications levels between 2004 and 2018 rose fastest in the lowest skilled occupations, with the over-qualification rate hovering at around 40% in the decade to 2017.  104  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  There is also considerable debate over the impact of automation and technology on certain jobs. New occupations could be created and current ones made redundant or considerably changed. But some experts urge caution against: [assuming] the introduction of new technologies will automatically raise the demand for more skilled workers, increase productivity or reduce income inequality in Wales  Employers aren’t always interested in highly skilled workers Many enterprises are profitable without a highly-skilled workforce. This means many workers in Wales work in a ‘low-skills equilibrium’ where low demand for high level skills from employers mean there is little requirement or incentivisation for workers to gain higher level skills. While these firms can be profitable, low-skills equilibriums are associated with poorer personal outcomes and lower pay for their workers. However, just increasing the supply of highly skilled workers is not enough, it can just mean employers do not fully utilise those skills. The OECD explains that: having skills is not enough; to achieve growth, both for a country but also for an individual, skills must be put to productive use at work The policy implication is that the supply of skills into the labour market, and employer demand for higher level skills, must be considered at the same time.  Mismatches between skill supply and skill demand have negative consequences Low-skills equilibriums are just one outcome from the interaction between skill supply and skill demand.  105  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Outcomes from interactions between skills supply and employer demand  Source: adapted from Future of Skills & Lifelong Learning and Low skill traps in sectors and geographies .  Mismatched supply and demand can result in skills shortages and skills surpluses. While some level of skills mismatching is normal in a dynamic economy, it can: slow the adoption of new technologies, cause delays in production, increase labour turnover and reduce productivity. There are three approaches to trying to align skills with demand:   Learner preference: where providers adjust their curriculums to match the demand of learners. This is arguably the model operated in the UK higher education sector.   Central planning: where a central or regional body gathers data and labour market intelligence to forecast employer skills demand so skills provision can be centrally planned. This is the basis of the Regional Skills Partnership model used in Wales.  106  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd   Market determination: where learners are free to choose their programmes, but the programmes on offer are driven by employer demand, like the apprenticeship programme. The Employer Skills Survey sets out an understanding of skill mismatches in Wales.  Education participation falls with age, and part-time learning numbers continue to fall A UK Government Office for Science report contends that: Collectively [changes to employment patterns] point to lifelong learning as the pathway for skills-driven economic growth, building on the skills that individuals have when they leave the education system, and enabling workers to adapt to changing demands for skills. But the data paints a challenging picture. In general, participation in education and skills training falls significantly with age with the overall number of learners in further and higher education, and workbased learning falling substantially from aged 40 onwards. In 2019, over three-quarters of 16-18 year olds were in education or training. This falls to just over a third of 19-24 year olds (largely made-up of higher education students) and drops further among 25-30 year olds to just over 10%. At the same time, there has been a significant trend of falling part-time learning in higher and further education, and adult-community education. While recent reforms to part-time higher education student support appear to have stimulated an increase in higher education part-time learning, further analysis shows that this increase has been driven by The Open University. This suggests that the fall in part-time learning in higher education at least, presents a complex problem for policymakers, which goes beyond just the financial support available.  107  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Trend in part-time learners in Wales  Source: StatsWales  Employers are a key source of lifelong learning. Yet while the proportion of Welsh workers receiving training in the workplace has increased, the intensity of training has fallen. On top of this, the picture is not an even one, with one analysis showing that: Women, younger people, those with higher qualifications, occupants of higher skilled jobs and those who work in the public sector are the strongest beneficiaries [of work-place training].  Some argue current skills qualif ications do not prepare learners for change An ongoing debate in skills policy is what attributes courses should develop in learners. Should skills provision focus on preparing learners for specific job-related tasks, or be a broader offering, with more emphasis on general education and ‘soft skills’ that employers are known to value?  108  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Arguing against what it sees as the status quo, a Colegau Cymru commissioned report contends that there is too little general education in UK vocational qualifications: Unlike school and university, much of Further Education is concerned with immediately relevant competencies. […] In place of competencies it is important vocational education builds on the broader notion of capability – giving all citizens capacity to adapt rapidly to changing circumstances.  The challenges ahead Skills are one key road to making Wales more prosperous. But while qualification levels in Wales have risen, the new Welsh Government will face other deeper challenges if it is to ensure the skills system fulfils its potential to improve the prosperity of Wales.

Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Implementing major education reforms The current national curriculum and arrangements for meeting pupils’ Additional Learning Needs are “no longer fit for purpose”. Both were subject to major legislation in the previous Senedd and implementing these reforms, while recovering from the pandemic, is therefore likely to be among the top education priorities for the new Welsh Government. Michael Dauncey The new Welsh Government’s top education priorities – second only to recovering from the disruption caused by COVID-19 – are likely to be delivering on two laws passed in the previous Senedd:   the Curriculum and Assessment (Wales) Act 2021, and  the Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018. These Acts respectively change how and what all three to 16 year olds are taught, and how over a fifth of pupils are supported with their learning difficulties.  A purpose-led Curriculum for Wales The national curriculum, which was introduced in England and Wales in 1988, has already been adapted under devolution. The most notable change was the introduction of the Foundation Phase in 2010, in place of Key Stage 1. However, the Curriculum and Assessment (Wales) Act 2021 marks the beginning of a distinct Welsh curriculum. And it’s a big change, covering not only what’s taught but how it’s taught. The new age 3-16 Curriculum for Wales moves away from a heavily prescribed national curriculum, which the last Welsh Government said is “no longer fit for purpose”. Professor Graham Donaldson’s ‘Successful Futures’ review (2015) identified a need for change, not just to support Wales’ mission to improve school standards but to give young people what they need for a vastly different world to the one of 1988. He also said too much prescription and detail inhibits the responsiveness of the curriculum to social, economic and technological changes.  110  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  The new curriculum is therefore intended to be purpose-led rather than contentbased, with a greater emphasis on skills and teaching what matters. Schools will have the flexibility to design their own curriculum, within a broad national framework provided by the Act and associated codes and guidance. As highlighted during scrutiny, the education sector will have to strike a delicate balance in delivering school-level curricula that remain similar enough so that all pupils receive equal experiences across all schools in Wales. The curriculum will be structured around four purposes, six Areas of Learning and Experience (AoLEs) and three cross-curricular skills. Schools’ curricula will also need to be suitable, broad and balanced, enabling pupils to make appropriate progression. English, Welsh, Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) and Religion, Values and Ethics (RVE) will be mandatory elements. Remaining details will be set out in statutory codes and guidance. The last Welsh Government published the provisional Curriculum for Wales in January 2020. Following the Senedd’s passing of the legislation in March 2021, the new Welsh Government is expected to formally make this the statutory curriculum in all maintained (that is, publicly funded) schools.  When will the Curriculum for Wales be introduced? The last Welsh Government published an implementation plan for the new curriculum in January 2021. Rather than a ‘big bang’ approach, it intended for it to be introduced in phases. The Curriculum for Wales will be introduced in September 2022 in early years, primary school and Year 7 (usually the first year of secondary school). It will then be rolled out to subsequent year groups as these pupils progress through school, until they reach Year 11 in 2026/27. The previous Minister said during scrutiny of the legislation that the timetable is unchanged by COVID-19 but will be kept under review.  111  What’s next?

Weaknesses of the current system, identified in previous reviews dating back many years, include families often having to battle to secure provision for their child, insufficient joint working between local government and health, and inconsistencies in how different learners’ needs are met. Currently, around 100,000 pupils (21%) are recognised as having “Special Educational Needs” (SEN), or “Additional Learning Needs” (ALN) as they will be called under the new system. This means they:   have a significantly greater difficulty in learning than the majority of others of the same age (that can’t be addressed solely through differentiated teaching), or   a disability (for the purposes of the Equality Act 2010) which prevents or hinders them accessing education or training that’s generally provided for others of the same age, and   the learning difficulty or disability calls for Additional Learning Provision (ALP).  112  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Pupils currently have their SEN met under three levels of support, depending on how severe and complex their needs are. Only ‘Statements of SEN’, which are issued by the local authority and set out what provision is needed to meet the learner’s needs, are legally enforceable. The 2018 Act has three main aims:   a single system for children from birth, pupils in schools and students in colleges, regardless of level of need. Each learner with ALN will be given a statutory ‘Individual Development Plan’ (IDP);   closer collaboration between the NHS and local government through a designated liaison officer within each health board, and   a more transparent system to avoid disagreement and resolve disputes. When will the new ALN system start? The previous Education Minister, Kirsty Williams, confirmed in February 2021 the plan to implement the new ALN system over a three-year period from September 2021. In March, the Senedd voted to approve the ALN Code which the last Welsh Government described as an “operational handbook” for how the new system will work in practice. From September 2021, all learners newly identified as having ALN will come under the new system. Pupils who already have SEN will transition across, between 2021 and 2024, starting with those who have low to moderate needs. Those with more severe or complex needs (who currently have statements of SEN) will move to the new system later in the three-year period. The timing will also depend on the pupil’s year group. By the end of 2023/24, all pupils with ALN are scheduled to have moved over to the new system.  113  What’s next?

Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  What might prevent the reforms being delivered successfully? The insufficiency and complexity of school funding was highlighted throughout the last Senedd. The Children, Young People and Education (CYPE) Committee found in its 2019 inquiry that not enough money was reaching schools and in its final report of the previous Senedd called for resources to be distributed to schools more effectively – especially given the scale of reform schools are now expected to deliver. The previous Welsh Government allocated £20 million to be spread over four years to its ’ALN Transformation Programme’. It also said it would respond to the recommendations of the Sibieta review on school funding. These recommendations include keeping the new ALN system under continual review to ensure it’s implemented as intended, as well as the possible need for additional funding. Applying the new flexibility to deliver school-level curricula will also require a culture change among a profession used to teaching a prescribed national curriculum for over thirty years. The previous Welsh Government planned to allocate £15 million per year until 2025-26 for ’professional learning’ to enable the education workforce to deliver the new curriculum. Estyn, the schools inspectorate, is also visiting schools to help them prepare. As for COVID-19, some stakeholders, for example the teaching union NASUWT, believe the impact of the pandemic means the new curriculum should be delayed. Others, for example Estyn, have said the way schools have had to innovate during the pandemic could make them better placed to deliver the Curriculum for Wales. Moving into the Sixth Senedd, both the backdrop of COVID-19 and the longstanding imperative of raising educational standards will loom large over a government and education sector tasked with implementing major reforms.  115  What’s next?

Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  119  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Climate change: the path to zero emissions With a target of net-zero emissions by 2050 now in law, does Wales have the commitment, legislation and policy in place to achieve this? Chloe Corbyn In 2019 the Welsh Government declared a climate emergency. Speaking at the time, the Environment Minister Lesley Griffiths, said: We hope that the declaration by Welsh Government today can help to trigger a wave of action at home and internationally. From our own communities, businesses and organisations to parliaments and governments around the world. But what has the declaration meant for the scale and pace of action to tackle climate change? Have emissions reduced across all sectors? And how should recent changes to our climate change legislation be translated into action if we are to meet our ambitious targets?  Global context In late 2015, the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21) took place in Paris. The meeting was hailed as a make-or-break opportunity to secure an international agreement on approaches to tackling climate change. The subsequent landmark ‘Paris Agreement’ aimed to limit global warming to less than 20C above pre-industrial levels, and preferably keep it below 1.50C. In 2019, prior to the pandemic, the estimated global emissions for 2030 were not expected to achieve the Paris Agreement’s goal. Instead, emissions were expected to reach around 30C above pre-industrial levels. Global climate ambition has subsequently increased, with major economies such as China, Japan and South Korea declaring net-zero objectives, and the new US administration expected to re-join the Paris Agreement. While Wales, along with the other countries of the UK, is not a signatory to the Paris Agreement, the UK as a whole is. As a significant contributor to UK emissions – particularly in the industry and agriculture sectors - Wales’ contribution is crucial to UK climate leadership and action on the global stage.  120  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  The UK will host the next United Nations climate talks – the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP 26) – in Glasgow in November 2021. Originally scheduled for November 2020, COP 26 heralds a key moment in efforts to raise global climate ambition. Countries are expected to resubmit their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) for emissions reduction to 2030.  A f ramework for action The Environment (Wales) Act 2016 marked a step change in Wales’ approach to tackling climate change. Progressing from an annual (non-statutory) target of a 3% year-on-year reduction, the Act placed new duties on the Welsh Government to ensure greenhouse gas emissions reduce. It also introduced a carbon budgeting method to measure progress towards reducing emissions. The Act set a target for an 80% reduction in emissions by 2050 and a duty to set interim targets for 2020, 2030 and 2040. Following advice from the UK Climate Change Committee (CCC) in April and December 2017, the interim emissions targets and first two carbon budgets were set in regulations in December 2018. In March 2019, the Welsh Government published Prosperity for All: A low carbon Wales. This low carbon delivery plan set out how Wales aimed to meet the first carbon budget (2016-2020) and the 2020 interim target through 100 policies and proposals across Ministerial portfolios. In 2019 the CCC advised the Welsh Government to amend its 2050 target and reduce emissions by 95% by that date. The Welsh Government accepted this advice and declared its ambition to achieve netzero by 2050. Revised advice from the CCC in December 2020 recommended that Wales should set and pursue the more ambitious net-zero by 2050 target. In February 2021 the Welsh Government laid four further sets of regulations. These:  What does net-zero mean? Net-zero means that total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions would be equal to or less than the emissions removed from the environment. This can be achieved by a combination of emission reduction and emission removal.   amended the 2050 emissions target to net-zero;  increased the 2030 target to 63% (from 45%) and the 2040 target to 89% (from 67%); and  121  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd   set the third carbon budget (2026-2030). Progress to date Emissions of greenhouse gases in Wales have fallen by 31% since 1990. The most recent data shows that Welsh emissions fell by 8% in 2018, and between 2016 and 2018 they reduced by close to 20%. As things stand, it looks like Wales is on track to meet its 2020 emissions target of a 27% reduction against the 1990 baseline, as long as emissions didn’t increase in 2019 and 2020. This won’t be confirmed until the data is available later this year. The fall in total emissions over recent years has not been distributed evenly across all sectors. Reductions have been dominated by the power sector, which was responsible for 85% of the total reduction in emissions from 2016 to 2018. Emissions from manufacturing and construction (-9%) and fuel supply (-7%) have also fallen, but emissions in all other sectors fell by an average of just 1%. In particular, the slowdown and closure of Aberthaw coal fired power station contributed to 55% of the total fall in emissions between 2016 and 2020. Emissions from agriculture and land use, land use change and forestry did not change between 2016 and 2018, and have only reduced by 13% since 1990. Emissions from livestock account for 54% of agricultural emissions. Wales reduced its tree planting target from 5,000 hectares per year to 2,000 hectares per year. Trees play a crucial role in removing emissions from the atmosphere. Disappointingly, in 2019, only 80 hectares of trees were planted in Wales. The planting of a National Forest has begun in earnest this year, and the previous Welsh Government hoped that a new sustainable land management approach will help to address emissions from the agricultural sector. Surface transport is Wales’ third largest source of emissions. Between 2016 and 2018 emissions from surface transport fell by 2%, but emissions in 2018 were still 3% higher than the baseline. The Welsh Government recently published its new transport strategy, focusing on active travel and supporting the transition to electric vehicles. Time will tell whether this marks a shift in our stubbornly high emissions from transport. Emissions from buildings have also increased since 2014. The rate of installation of new renewable energy capacity has fallen every year since 2015. And between 2016 and 2018 emissions from aviation increased by 29%. But there are glimmers of hope. Waste sector emissions continue to decline, and the new circular economy strategy aims to capitalise on Wales progress to date, and its position as third best in the world for recycling. 122  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Are we doing enough? While there have been some reductions in emissions in recent years, and a renewed commitment from the previous Welsh Government to tackling climate change, there is still much more to be done. The second low carbon delivery plan is due to be published in November 2021, and will set out polices and proposals to meet the second carbon budget. The CCC recommended that the plan should go further, setting out a long-term vision to meet the net-zero goal. Members of the Sixth Senedd will have a central role in scrutinising the plan and holding the new Welsh Government to account on progress. The CCC has estimated the costs of hitting the targets as being an additional £3 billion per year by 2030 for Wales – so scrutiny of Welsh Government spending on the decarbonisation agenda, and whether it’s delivering on ambition, will also be key. The CCC highlights that gaps remain – particularly the lack of underlying indicators to measure progress, and lack of a cohesive, economy-wide emissions reduction strategy for 2050. It cautions that Wales is not currently on track to meet an 80% emissions reduction target by 2050, let alone net-zero. The Welsh Government’s next low carbon delivery plan will be crucial in assessing how serious Wales is about tackling the climate crisis.

Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Clean air for Wales Wales has some of the worst air quality in the UK. Why does air quality matter and what might we see during the Sixth Senedd to tackle the pollution problem? Francesca Howorth Wales has some of the worst air quality in the UK. Cardiff and Port Talbot have recorded higher particulate matter levels than Birmingham or Manchester and a road in Caerphilly recorded the highest levels of pollution outside of London. Some areas in Wales have breached EU regulations for several years, culminating in the last Welsh Government being taken to court for its lack of action.  Why does air quality matter? Public Health Wales has described outdoor air pollution as the greatest environmental risk to health. It estimates between 1,000-1,400 deaths per year in Wales can be attributed to exposure to air pollution. Poor air quality has huge social costs through its impacts on health, and adverse effects on wildlife and biodiversity. But tackling air pollution is not only a health or environmental issue, it’s a matter of social justice. Researchers have described a ‘triple jeopardy effect’ at play – where those from a low socio-economic status are exposed to higher levels of pollution because of where they live or work. A 2016 study found air pollution to be higher in Wales’ most deprived areas. It concluded that air pollution, deprivation and health are inextricably linked. On a global scale, the World Bank estimates the cost associated with health damage from air pollution to be $5.7 trillion, equivalent to 4.8% of global GDP.  How is air quality managed? Air pollution limits in Wales are set by a range of UK and European regulations. The European Union Ambient Air Quality Directive sets legally binding limits for certain pollutants in outdoor air. Following the UK’s exit from the EU, these limits have been retained. Air quality management in Wales mainly takes place at local authority level using a variety of monitoring methods. Local authorities produce annual progress  124  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  reports and identify any areas where limits are likely to be exceeded. Where this is the case they must implement an Air Quality Management Area (AQMA). There are currently 44 AQMAs across Wales.  Which pollutants are most concerning? The main air pollutants that affect our health are nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3) and other small, particulate matter (PM). PM is the term for a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air and is classified by size, with PM2.5 representing smaller size particles than PM10. PM2.5 is considered to be the more dangerous to health. Map 1  Modelled mean background concentration of PM10 (Map 1), PM2.5 (Map 2) and NO2 (Map 3), 2019.

Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Most breaches of EU limits within the UK are a result of roadside NO2, 80% of which comes from road transport. Of Wales’ 44 AQMAs, all have been declared for NO2, with the exception of Neath Port Talbot which has been declared for PM10. The Port Talbot AQMA covers land and properties between the steel works and the M4 motorway. In 2018, breaches of NO2 limits saw the then Welsh Government taken to court. The High Court ruled that the Welsh section of the UK’s plan to tackle roadside NO2 did not satisfy EU requirements. It also ruled that managing exceedances of NO2 on the motorway and trunk road network was the direct responsibility of the Welsh Government. The then Welsh Government published its supplemental plan to the UK plan for tackling roadside nitrogen dioxide concentrations later that year. To tackle NO2 emissions, 50mph speed limits have been introduced at five sites on the trunk road and motorway network. The latest annual report on roadside NO2 concentrations says that although emissions are falling at all five sites, the situation remains “complicated”. In March 2021 the then Welsh Government launched the new Wales Transport Strategy. It includes a sustainable transport hierarchy which places travel by private motor car at the bottom of the list. It also sets a target for 45% of journeys to be made by public transport, walking or cycling by 2040. It’s currently estimated that 32% of journeys are made this way.  Was the pandemic good for air quality? It’s complicated. On a global scale, lockdowns resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic led to the largest reduction in greenhouse gas emissions ever recorded. Research published in March 2021 found that emissions would need to drop by the equivalent of a global lockdown roughly every two years to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. In 2020 the then Welsh Government commissioned a report from its independent Clean Air Advisory Panel to explore the pandemic’s impact on air quality in Wales. It found that NO2 levels decreased by an average of 36% at roadside monitoring sites for the period February to May 2020. But the report paints a mixed picture. While lockdown saw reduced traffic and decreased NO2 levels, increases in PM levels were recorded. While this can partly  126  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  be attributed to weather conditions, it’s suggested this may also be due to an increase in waste being burnt, with household waste and recycling centres closed during lockdown. Responding to the report, Public Health Wales said the analysis shows that achieving significant change in travel behaviour is possible. In September 2020 the last Welsh Government announced its aim for 30% of the Welsh workforce to work remotely.  What could be on the horizon to tackle Wales’ pollution problem? In August 2020 the last Welsh Government launched its Clean Air Plan for Wales: Healthy Air, Healthy Wales. It identified a range of actions:   investing in active travel infrastructure;  strengthening the control of emissions in agriculture – the last Welsh Government introduced controversial regulations that came into force in April 2021;   publishing a Clean Air Zone Framework for Wales in Spring 2021, taking into account the findings of a review into road user charging; and   implementing a national air pollution and monitoring service by December 2022. The plan also set out an intention to introduce a new Clean Air Act for Wales. In January 2021, the last Welsh Government published a White Paper setting out a number of legislative proposals. An indicative timetable within the White Paper suggests drafting of the Bill would commence in 2022. Healthy Air Cymru welcomed the plans but says the timetable for enacting the legislation is “far too slow”. It points to the fact that “it could be as late as 2024 before any regulations come into effect”. The White Paper includes proposals to:   introduce a legal requirement for a Clean Air Plan or Strategy to be reviewed at least every 5 years;  127  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd   strengthen powers for local authorities to address vehicle idling, including powers to increase the fixed penalty amount that can be issued;   introduce an enhanced Local Air Quality Management Regime; and  enact a new target for PM levels, taking account of World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines – the WHO has recommended guidelines for PM2.5 levels that are half the current EU limit. It also makes proposals in relation to smoke control areas where it is an offence to emit smoke from a chimney of a building unless using an approved fuel or appliance. It proposes that these powers are extended to include outdoor burning such as bonfires. Alongside the White Paper the last Welsh Government launched a consultation on proposals to reduce emissions from domestic burning of solid fuel. It proposes a ban on the sale of wet wood and traditional house coal – fuels which some in rural areas rely upon to heat their homes. Similar measures have already been set out in England. Whether these plans are a breath of fresh air or the outlook remains hazy is yet to be seen. What is clear is that air quality will be a major challenge for the next Welsh Government to address.

Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  A new landscape for farmers and nature? The Sixth Senedd will see the biggest change to land management policy in decades. What could this mean for rural communities and the natural environment? Katy Orford Leaving the EU means Wales is able to develop novel agricultural schemes. Farming policy, which is devolved, has implications for the environment, economy and culture of Wales and has been a hot topic since the EU referendum. The last Welsh Government proposed to fundamentally change farming policy to support wider sustainable land management, moving away from payment for food production in its own right. While environmentalists have welcomed this approach, tensions have risen in farming communities with the unions calling for payments for producing food. Future policy decisions will be made within a complex agri-food trading landscape and amidst the climate and nature emergencies. Welsh farming statistics (figures are for 2018 or 2019, depending on the most current available)  Source: June Survey, Agriculture in the UK 2019, Welsh Government press release, Agriculture in Wales 2019 and Agriculture facts and figures: 2019.  129  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Leaving the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy behind The UK joined the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in 1973. Originally, farmers received income to supplement prices paid for their produce to ensure food security and a good standard of living. But this encouraged overproduction, resulting in the notorious ‘wine lakes’ and ‘butter mountains’ of the late 20th century. A major CAP reform in 2005 moved to payments broadly based on the area of land farmed. Farmers received direct payments (most recently through the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS)) and also support for rural development (for example the Glastir agri-environment scheme). Many farmers in Wales have relied heavily on the CAP for income, particularly the BPS, more so than in any other UK country. Farm income  * LFA = Less Favoured Area, ** BPS = Basic Payment Scheme Source: Farm Business Survey (data as reported in Agriculture in Wales 2019)  Now the UK has left the CAP, an interim CAP-style system is being maintained under the UK Agriculture Act 2020 until Wales transitions to new domestic schemes. There has been disagreement between the Welsh Government and UK Government over whether commitments to provide full replacement funding for the schemes have been met. This is due to different interpretations of ongoing EU funding being provided through the Rural Development Programme.  130  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Some see exit from the CAP as an opportunity for radical change arguing that the CAP restricted environmental improvement, distributed payments unfairly .(due to larger farms receiving more support) and was too complex. Others remain cautious given the high reliance on BPS income and the uncertainty associated with leaving the EU and the COVID-19 pandemic. The Welsh Government published a White Paper in December 2020 for an Agriculture (Wales) Bill (planned for summer 2022) to establish new land management schemes.  A future farming policy based on public goods? The White Paper proposals set out a very different and ambitious approach to agricultural support. Based on the principle of sustainable land management, the policy would reward farmers for providing ‘public goods’ from the land, including both social and environmental outcomes. The policy arguably goes beyond the CAP, supporting wider land management improvement. Contrary to the CAP, farmers would not receive support specifically for producing food. The Welsh Government has argued that as food has a market value it should not be classed as a public good, and so should not be directly funded by the state. Instead, funding would focus on the non-marketable benefits of sustainable food production such as enhancing biodiversity and carbon sequestration (capturing and storing carbon). This might be through enhancing wildflower diversity on farms or tree planting alongside food production. Environmentalists have broadly welcomed the proposals highlighting the climate and nature emergencies. Some are calling for a quicker timeline for transition. Conversely, farmers are calling for food production to be eligible for support in its own right, holding concerns for the future of rural communities if this direct support is lost. The new proposals may require farm diversification which many have welcomed to build business resilience. However academics have warned that farm businesses in Wales face several hurdles to diversification, such as poor upland land quality and remoteness from centres of population.  131  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  A new domestic and international trading landscape for the agrifood sector The future agricultural policy will be developed in the context of new trade agreements. Farmers are calling for a trade strategy that seeks to both maximise access to overseas markets while safeguarding Wales’s high food and farming standards. Agri-food trade statistics (by value) The latest information available is from 2019, before the UK left the EU Common Market. The UK agri-food sector relies heavily on foreign trade - in 2019 55% of food and drink consumed in the UK was produced in the UK. Imports: The EU has been the biggest source of the UK’s food and drink imports: 26% of food and drink consumed in the UK in 2019 came from the EU. The next biggest sources of food and drink imports were Africa, North America, South America, and Asia (each of these categories providing 4% of food consumed). Exports: The EU is also the UK’s biggest food export market at just under 60% of food and drink exports in 2019. Wales exports a greater proportion of its food and drink to the EU than the UK as a whole, at 75% of total Welsh food and drink exports in 2019. The top non-EU destinations for Welsh exports in 2019 were the USA, Turkey, Australia, Saudi Arabia and Canada.  The previous Welsh Government envisioned a Welsh food brand based on environmental and social sustainability that would complement the public goods scheme for farmers. The Welsh Government’s ability to achieve these ambitions will be influenced by the UK Government’s decisions on international trade. The UK Government says that new trade agreements could present opportunities for the agri-food sector. However some Welsh businesses are concerned about increased competition from imports with lower standards, as well as new barriers to trade between the UK and EU.  132  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Lamb trade  Source: Adapted from Agriculture in Wales 2019  At a UK level, constitutional arrangements for policy divergence are becoming increasingly complex. Common frameworks and the UK internal market as well as the UK’s international obligations all limit the Welsh Government’s freedom to act in this area (see ‘Wales in the UK’ article.) For example, the Internal Market Act 2020 will have significant implications for agri-food policy. Part 1 of the Act means that products that meet the standards in one part of the UK can automatically be sold anywhere else in the UK, even if the standards are different. This has sparked concerns that the rules of the largest market, England, will drive standards across the whole of the UK.  Developing a future farming policy amidst the climate and nature emergencies The agricultural policy will be developed in the context of the climate emergency, declared by the Welsh Government and Senedd in 2019, and the nature crisis as described by the environment sector. The Convention on Biodiversity treaty recently concluded that the international community failed its ten-year goal to halt the loss of nature by 2020. The environment sector’s collaborative State of Nature Report 2019 highlighted that 17% of species in Wales are threatened with extinction (see climate change article).  133  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Public and political emphasis on a green recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic has stimulated debate on ‘nature based solutions’ such as catchment management to reduce flooding and a national forest to tackle climate change. The future farming policy will no doubt feature in these debates.  Species extinction risk assessment in Wales (1970 baseline)  Decisions on agricultural policy in the Sixth Senedd will not be easy. Politicians will need to consider the viability and culture of rural communities; the Source: The State of Nature Report 2019 developing trading environment and the declared nature and climate emergencies.

Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  137  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Under pressure: how are local government services changing? Are local government services at a tipping point? Following a decade of austerity, and now a pandemic, what will services look like in the future? Osian Bowyer and Owen Holzinger The funding pressures on local government over the last decade have been a catalyst for change in local service delivery. Increasing costs and lower income for local authorities means some services have reduced or are being run differently. The pandemic put significant new demands on local government, exacerbating existing pressures. The future of local government services is uncertain and how it responds to the challenges will shape those services for years to come.  How has spending on local services changed? The shape of local authority services has changed significantly over the last decade. Overall local authority spending has decreased by around 7% since 2013-14 (in real terms), in contrast expenditure on social services has increased by over 10%. Spending in most other service areas has been cut, including in education. Planning and economic development services have been hit particularly hard, as have libraries, culture, heritage, sport and recreation services.  138  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Percentage change in local authority service expenditure, 2013-14* to 2019-20 (2019-20 prices)  Source: StatsWales – Revenue outturn expenditure, by services and GDP Deflators (March 2021) *2013-14 used as baseline due to changes to data collection that make comparisons with previous years less consistent.  Together, social services and education made up over two-thirds of total expenditure on services by the 22 local authorities in 2019-20.  139  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Change in local authority expenditure, 2013-14 to 2019-20 (2019-20 prices)  Source: StatsWales – Revenue outturn expenditure, by services, and GDP Deflators (March 2021)  But while social services have been protected from the most severe spending reductions, this won’t be enough to ensure its sustainability for the future. A 2017 report by Wales Public Services 2025 found that: … spending through local authorities on social care for the over 65s is not keeping pace with the growth in the population of older people. Spending may need to have increased by at least £129 million (23%) between 2015-16 and 2020-21 to get back to the equivalent spend perhead in 2009-10. The ONS estimates that, between 2021 and 2031, the population of Wales will grow by just over 60,000 (1.9%). Within that population growth, there’s a projected increase in the proportion of older people. The population of over 65s is due to increase by around 119,000 (17.5%). Wales Fiscal Analysis notes that, while future demand for care can’t simply be linked to growth in older populations, a projected growth in older people with complex care needs is highly likely to result in increased pressure on care services. It details that the number of older adults living with severe dementia is expected to double to 53,700 by 2040. The Inter-Ministerial group on paying for social care estimated in a ‘high-cost’ scenario that, between 2019-20 and 2022-23, the net costs of social care could increase by almost £400 million.  140  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Wales Fiscal Analysis projects that by 2025-26, social services could account for 55% of all local government spending pressures, with school pressures accounting for a further 21%.  Increased reliance on council tax? Where local authorities get the money to spend on services has also started to shift. There’s been a reduction in grant funding to local authorities over the period 201314 to 2019-20, some of which has been mitigated by local taxes. While grant funding still makes up the majority of local authority income, the amount to be collected from council tax payers (excluding council tax benefit/reduction scheme funding) was up by almost 30% over the same period. The overall increase reflects annual increases in council tax paid by residents over the period. With average band D council tax (excluding the police element) increasing in real terms by £186. However, local authorities have consistently warned that raising council tax is not, on its own, sufficient to fill funding gaps in the future. Despite a recent boost to local government finances, there are potential signs of turbulence ahead. Following the UK Budget 2021, Wales Fiscal Analysis notes that, “the UK government’s medium-term spending plans make for a more austere outlook for the Welsh budget and Welsh public services” and outline the possibility of a return to austerity for parts of the Welsh budget. The financial impact of the pandemic on local government is likely to be felt for many years. Audit Wales notes that, even in local authorities generating a budget surplus in 2018-19, some had significant overspends in demand-led services like social services. It suggests those pressures are likely to intensify as a result of the pandemic.  Improving public services: a cultural shift Local government has in the last few years embarked on a journey to transform how it delivers services. Local authorities are thinking differently about how to improve services for users, while reducing the cost of running them. An example of this is ‘one-stop-shops’ or ‘hubs’. These hubs host multiple council services under one roof, such as libraries, money advice and adult learning services.  141  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  One of the most significant aspects of the transformation programme is to make better use of technology and digital tools. The previous Welsh Government established a Local Government Digital Transformation Fund to “maximise and identify opportunities to progress the digital transformation of local government in Wales”. The Digital Strategy for Wales, launched in March 2021 is another step in this journey. It sets out a national vision for digital transformation, and seeks a cultural shift in how public bodies “deliver and modernise services” that are designed around user needs. In the past year, local authority resources have been diverted from some of this transformational work. Anticipated financial savings are less certain, with the WLGA recently suggesting there’s doubt about when, and indeed if, some of those savings will now happen. Yet there are examples of how the pandemic has sped-up digital change across local government:   establishing an all-Wales virtual autism team, which includes professionals and people with autism;   developing community support mobile apps to coordinate volunteering; and  developing virtual learning and delivery platforms to engage, educate, inform and support young people. Developing on areas of digital innovation and good practice will likely be one priority area for the next Minister with responsibility for local government.  What next for local government? The passing of the Local Government and Elections (Wales) Act 2021 gives local authorities new tools and powers to deal with some of the many challenges facing the sector. For example, the Welsh Government suggests the general power of competence within the Act enables local authorities to consider more transformative approaches to service delivery. The Act also lays the groundwork for Corporate Joint Committees (CJCs), bodies designed to enable greater regional working and collaboration in areas like education and transport.  142  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  However, questions remain about how these new bodies will operate. Responses to a recent consultation on CJCs by the previous Welsh Government show there’s still uncertainty about how they’ll function and their associated costs and benefits. Despite the recent increase in the local government settlement for next year, and the substantial funding support in response to the pandemic, significant challenges remain. Wales Fiscal Analysis suggests that to meet cost pressures over the next few years, spending on local services needs to increase, on average, by 3.4% a year (in cash terms) between 2020-21 and 2025-26. The WLGA recently reported that core pressures, that’s the financial gap in money coming in and that required to pay for services, could amount to as much as £822 million by 2023-24. Leaning on local taxation, such as council tax, to support key services like social care and education won’t stem the demand for, and cost of providing those services. The challenges of the last 12 months have nevertheless brought with them opportunities. Local government has adapted quickly to new ways of working using digital approaches to deliver improved and responsive services to users. Sustaining such momentum and investment will be critical to recovery in the coming years.

Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Taxing times in the Sixth Senedd? What will Welsh taxes look like in the future? Will local taxes be reformed and will the Welsh Government introduce new taxes in the Sixth Senedd? Christian Tipples In April 2018, the first Welsh taxes in almost eight hundred years were introduced using newly devolved powers. Significant issues may need to be confronted in the Sixth Senedd. It’s unclear how the pandemic will impact devolved tax policy, particularly income tax. Criticisms of the approach to local taxation and proposals for new taxes developed in the Fifth Senedd may also lead to big changes. Yet tax policy is a sensitive subject so implementing any changes may prove challenging for the next Welsh Government.  New taxes for Wales In 2018, Land Transaction Tax (LTT) and Landfill Disposals Tax (LDT), replaced UK Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) and Landfill Tax (LT) becoming the first uniquely Welsh taxes since the 13th century. This was followed by the implementation of Welsh Rates of Income Tax (WRIT) in April 2019, which is the largest source of tax revenue available to the Welsh Government. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the body responsible for forecasting Welsh tax revenues, estimated that the Welsh Government would receive over £2.1 billion in WRIT revenue in 2021-22, while LTT and LDT would raise £260 million (before an extension to the LTT holiday) and £34 million respectively. Welsh tax revenues represent 17% of the Welsh Government’s budget for 2021-22.  144  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Composition of the Welsh Government’s Budget 2021-22  Source: Welsh Government Draft Budget narrative 2021-22 and OBR’s March 2021 Devolved tax & spending forecasts  WRIT changes There have yet to be any changes to WRIT with Welsh Labour committing in 2019 not to increase income tax rates during the Fifth Senedd. However, given the economic challenges faced by Wales due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Sixth Senedd could see pressure for the first rate changes to WRIT . The porous nature of the Wales-England border means any divergence between UK and Welsh income tax rates could lead to taxpayers migrating across the border, impacting on future WRIT revenues. Given that nearly 48% of the Welsh population live within 25 miles of the border and 4.9 million within a similar distance on the English side, this could be a significant issue.  145  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Local taxes Council tax is one of the financial levers available to local government. Around £1.8 billion is raised annually from 1.4 million dwellings. The Welsh Government has amended the council tax regime in various ways. For example, in the Fifth Senedd local authorities gained powers to charge a premium of up to 100% on second homes. An Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) review, published last year, concluded that council tax was “out of date, regressive and distortionary”, suggesting it needed to be “revalued and reformed”. Non-domestic rates (NDR) – often known as ‘business rates’ - are also a significant revenue source, generating over £1 billion annually for local government. Those funds are collected and pooled nationally before being redistributed among local government bodies. Revaluations are more frequent than for council tax, the most recent having taken place in 2017. The next list was originally planned for 2021, but due to the pandemic will not come into effect until 2023 in order to “better reflect the impact of COVID-19”. A number of changes to NDR were made in the Fifth Senedd, including implementing a permanent Small Business Rates Relief scheme, switching the inflation measure used for uprating from RPI to CPI and efforts to tackle avoidance. The UK Government is currently undertaking a fundamental review of business rates (due to conclude in autumn 2021), any changes may have implications for the pace of change in Wales. That review considers the possibility of more frequent - three yearly - revaluations, something that has already been implemented in Scotland.  Alternative approaches to local taxes Several studies have acknowledged that council tax is regressive. As such, the Welsh Government has looked at the feasibility of replacing council tax and NDR with a local land value tax (LVT). This system of taxation operates in Denmark, New Zealand and some parts of Australia and the United States. LVT is a levy on the value of land and, unlike most property taxes, is a tax on the land itself disregarding the value of any improvements made to that land.  146  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  The Welsh Government commissioned Bangor University to conduct an initial feasibility study of LVT. It found that that while it could raise sufficient revenues to replace current local taxes, the data requirements to implement LVT weren’t currently met. The previous Finance Minister, Rebecca Evans, told the Fifth Senedd’s Finance Committee that the Welsh Government has also commissioned the Institute for Fiscal Studies to consider the impact of a council tax revaluation to make the system less regressive, and Cardiff University to conduct research into whether council tax could be based on local assessments of household income.  New taxes The Wales Act 2014 enables the Welsh Government to seek competence from both Houses of the UK Parliament and the Senedd to introduce new taxes to Wales. The Welsh Government is currently seeking powers for a vacant land tax and investigating three other potential areas for new taxes:   Social care levy;  Disposable plastic tax; and  Tourism tax. The last Welsh Government found the process “protracted and challenging”, and claimed the mechanism is “not fit for purpose”. The Minister stated: It has become apparent there are serious flaws in the agreed process for devolution of further tax competence. As the process currently stands, it is difficult to envision a scenario whereby the Welsh Government could successfully make the case for further tax competence. The process needs urgent review and reform. This is highlighted in the Minister’s recent final report on the implementation and operation of the financial powers devolved in the Wales Act 2014. The report also provides an update on the other potential areas for new taxes. How the next Welsh Government can drive changes to this process, and the type of new taxes it could introduce, will play a significant role in tax policy over the next Senedd term.  147  What’s next?

Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Budgeting for recovery The Fifth Senedd saw a move away from austerity and ended with massive public spending to deal with the pandemic. How has spending changed? And what pressures lie ahead for Wales? Owen Holzinger Spending on public services since the 2008 financial crisis has largely been characterised by austerity. At the Spending Round in September 2019, the UK Government signalled it was “turning the page on austerity and beginning a new decade of renewal”. The Welsh Government’s 2019-20 and 2020-21 budgets were subsequently referred to as “a step-change in the path of the Welsh resource budget”.  Budgets in the Fifth Senedd While budgets in the Fifth Senedd saw an increase in the Welsh Government’s spending power, it’s only since 2019-20 that the total Welsh budget has increased to levels above 2009-10 (in real terms). Even with that, spending on Welsh Government departments has generally remained below historic levels.  149  What’s next?

For 2020-21, figures at the Final Budget, March 2020 (dashed) and those at the Third Supplementary Budget (February 2021) are included. Real terms figures reflect atypical movement in the 2020-21 GDP deflator.  The pandemic meant spending in 2020-21 looks very different to initial proposals. The Welsh Government’s Third Supplementary Budget 2020-21 allocated almost £25 billion to departments, a significant increase from the £18 billion originally planned. While the Welsh Government reprioritised some departmental spend, most of the increase is the result of spending decisions around the pandemic in England. The current budget for 2021-22 therefore sees a decrease in overall allocations to around £20 billion.  150  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Health and Social Services is consistently the biggest area of Welsh Government spending. In terms of day-to-day revenue spending it takes up over half of the 2021-22 budget. Alongside Housing and Local Government, the next largest area of Welsh Government expenditure, those two areas make up around 80% of departmental revenue budgets in 2021-22.  The Fiscal Framework The rules around Welsh Government funding are set out in the Fiscal Framework. Most of the Welsh Government’s money comes through the Welsh block grant, linked to UK Government spending through the Barnett Formula. This arrangement was bypassed to some extent during the pandemic, with the UK Government offering a ‘guarantee’ of funding. How the Barnett Formula works The Barnett formula calculates the annual change in the block grant. It uses the annual change in a UK Government department’s budget and applies a comparability percentage based on the extent to which that department’s services are devolved, it also takes into account the relative population of Wales. Wales also has a block grant floor, which ensures Wales’ funding will converge to a level in line with Wales’ needs. It is set at 115%. Currently the needs based factor is 105% as Wales’ relative funding per head is around 120%. Once Wales’ relative funding reaches 115% of England’s, the multiplier will be locked at 115%.  Other fiscal measures were perhaps not flexible enough when put under the strain of the pandemic. The Wales Reserve is capped at £350 million and limited to an annual maximum drawdown of £125 million revenue and £50 million capital.  151  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  The significant COVID-19 funding that came to Wales at the end of 2020-21, due to policy decisions in England, meant more flexibility was required to carry forward up to an additional £650 million. On the other hand, the Welsh Government hasn’t used all of the fiscal tools at its disposal. It can borrow up to £150 million capital annually, but hasn’t done so in 2019-20 or 2020-21. These issues led the Fifth Senedd’s Finance Committee to suggest that funding mechanisms needed urgent review. The Committee suggested:   capital borrowing limits should be increased;  there should be greater flexibility around the Wales Reserve; and  there should be an independent process for challenging funding decisions, noting the UK Government acted as ‘judge and jury’ when it comes to Wales’ funding arrangements.  New powers for UK investment in Wales The Internal Market Act 2020 allows the UK Government to provide financial assistance for various purposes (see our article on Wales in the UK), anywhere in the UK. It gives the UK Government new powers to directly fund activity in devolved policy areas. Two specific funds will take advantage of these powers:   the UK Shared Prosperity Fund (starting with the UK Community Renewal Fund), which will replace EU structural funds; and   the ‘Levelling Up Fund’. Initially a fund for England, but subsequently extended to cover the whole of the UK. Debate around the use of these powers has already begun. The previous Welsh Government suggested the UK Government planned to “bypass the devolution settlement” and the three Finance Ministers of the devolved nations issued a joint statement in March stating the UK Government was “ignoring [their] respective devolution arrangements”.  152  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  However, the Secretary of State for Wales, Simon Hart, suggested funds would have “a greater degree of local input” and that they represented an “extension of the devolution process”. It’s unclear how or whether the Welsh Government will be involved in these spending decisions, and how they will be scrutinised.  Familiar but signif icant pressures ahead? The costs of the pandemic will undoubtedly shape the future of public sector finances. UK Government borrowing is due to hit a peacetime high of £355 billion in 2020-21 and forecast at £234 billion for 2021-22. Headline debt for the UK is due to hit 100% of GDP in 2020-21 (see article on economic recovery). At the UK Government Budget in March 2021 the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, outlined the need to “begin the work of fixing our public finances”. The Chancellor now plans to spend between £14-17 billion a year less on public services each year after 2021, than was planned prior to the pandemic. It’s been suggested that medium-term spending plans make for “a more austere outlook for the Welsh budget and Welsh public services”. The implications of the pandemic for public finances won’t just be in terms of immediate financing of the response, but the long term pressures it creates for services. The previous Welsh Government allocated £320 million for a reconstruction package and £225 million for a capital stimulus package. The costs of recovery are only likely to increase. It’s been suggested that the NHS and Social Care in England would need an additional £12 billion a year to make up lost ground. In Wales, the NHS waiting list reached a record high of 549,353 in February 2021 (see article on NHS waiting times). The previous Minister for Health and Social Services, Vaughan Gething, estimated recovery would take at “least a full Senedd term”. A recovery plan for Health published in March outlined an “initial” £100 million of funding. Similarly, school closures led to the previous Welsh Government providing additional funding for pupils (see article on education in the time of COVID), but the scale and costs for pupils to ‘catch-up properly’ could be as much as “half a year of schooling”, around £1.4 billion.  153  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Others have called on the Welsh Government to exploit the opportunities that recovery presents to build back greener, including investing in green infrastructure, transforming transport and public spaces, and promoting remote working. Analysis suggests funding these pressures could lead to a return to austerity for parts of the Welsh Government’s budget, based on current UK Government spending plans. How these pressures emerge and are addressed will be a driving force for policy and spending decisions in the Sixth Senedd.

Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  157  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Wales in the UK Brexit has fundamentally changed the responsibilities of governments across the UK, making it more important than ever for them to cooperate. Can they find ways to work together effectively? Lucy Valsamidis and Nia Moss We think of responsibility for policy as either devolved to the Senedd or reserved to Westminster. The reality is more complex. The boundaries of where power lies are often blurred. Governments across the UK need to find ways to work together to manage these tensions – or risk failing to make effective policy decisions and tackle shared challenges. Brexit blurred these lines of responsibility further by transferring powers previously exercised by the EU to Wales and Westminster. Since 2016, the governments have worked to develop new ways of managing these powers. But they have struggled to agree on how these new structures should work and where responsibility should lie.  Brexit has shifted powers to governments in Wales and Westminster The Welsh Government is now responsible for about 4,000 new functions previously exercised at EU level. To take just one example, it can now change how water safety and quality are monitored. Constraints on the Senedd’s powers set by EU law have been removed – so if the Senedd wanted to change retained EU law on water quality, it could do that too. The UK Government also has a wide range of new responsibilities in reserved areas which impact on devolved policy, from establishing a new UK residency scheme for EU citizens to negotiating new international trade agreements (see the article on Wales in the new international landscape). Control of funding in devolved areas has changed too. For example, where the Welsh Government previously managed about £295 million per year in EU structural funds, the UK Internal Market Act 2020 now gives the UK Government powers to spend money in devolved areas like health and education. The UK  158  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Government plans to use these powers to establish a new Shared Prosperity Fund and a Levelling Up Fund (see ‘budgeting for recovery’ article). The total value of this funding is not yet known.  The governments have developed ways of managing their new responsibilities – but tensions remain The governments recognised that they would need to change the way they worked together to manage these new responsibilities. For example, if the UK Government negotiates an international trade agreement that requires animal health checks on exports, the Welsh Government has to make or agree legislation to implement those checks. Equally, if the Senedd decides to ban the sale of certain sugary drinks, that could affect drinks producers based outside Wales too. They sought to develop ‘common frameworks’ in about 26 policy areas, including food safety and air quality. These are agreements to work together to decide when to align policy and when to diverge, sometimes underpinned by legislation. The aim was to have all frameworks agreed by December 2020. But progress was slowed by delays in the UK-EU negotiations and final agreement hasn’t yet been reached. In July 2020, the UK Government said that it didn’t believe that common frameworks would be sufficient to manage divergence. It proposed what would become the UK Internal Market Act 2020. The Act establishes a new system for managing trade within the UK. At its heart is the idea that goods and services that meet standards set in one country of the UK should be able to be sold unhindered in the others, even if standards there are different.  159  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  If the Senedd wants to ban the sale of certain sugary drinks, can it do this? Does the Senedd have the power to introduce a ban?  Would the Welsh Government need to discuss and agree a ban with the other governments of the UK?  Could the UK Internal Market Act 2020 limit the effect of a ban?  Yes. Food and drink aren’t reserved in the Government of Wales Act 2006.  Yes. The governments have agreed provisional common frameworks on food composition and nutrition.  Yes. It’s likely that the mutual recognition principle would apply. This would mean that if the Senedd introduced a ban on sugary drinks, it wouldn’t apply to drinks permitted in any other part of the UK. The UK Government could exempt rules on sugary drinks, but it doesn’t have to do this.  So it’s likely they would need to discuss and agree whether to follow the same rules or diverge.  For example, the Senedd could ban single-use plastics. However, the Act means any single-use plastics permitted or imported into the rest of the UK could still be sold in Wales. The ban would apply to businesses based in Wales, but not to those based elsewhere in the UK. So the Senedd would need to consider if a ban would put businesses in Wales at a disadvantage – and if it would achieve its intended purpose. The last Welsh and Scottish Governments opposed the proposals. They said the Act would go further than the rules of the EU single market in limiting divergence within the UK. Committees in the Fifth Senedd also argued that it would set a new limit on devolved powers. The UK Parliament passed the UK Internal Market Bill in December 2020, after the Senedd and Scottish Parliament voted not to grant legislative consent.  160  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  The future of intergovernmental relations is still emerging With the Internal Market Act now law and the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement reached, there are still questions about how the governments should make decisions together and resolve disputes. The Joint Ministerial Committee (JMC) has been the main structure for managing intergovernmental relationships since 1999. The JMC is a set of committees bringing together ministers from the UK and devolved governments. They meet on an ad hoc basis to discuss common policy interests and address disputes. As things stand, the JMC can reach non-binding agreements, but can’t make executive decisions. It can consider disputes between governments, but devolved governments have criticised the dispute resolution process as weighted towards the UK Government. In 2018, the governments began a joint review of intergovernmental structures “ensure they are fit for purpose in light of the UK’s exit from the EU”. Politicians from different parties and parliaments agreed that “substantial reform” was needed. Three years on, the governments set out progress with the review, including proposals for new intergovernmental structures and a reformed dispute resolution process. The then Counsel General Jeremy Miles called this progress, but said he wanted further negotiation on how the governments should work together on EU and international relations and on finance. The next Welsh Government will need to decide how it wants to help shape the outcome of the review.  The Senedd will need to f ind ways of scrutinising how the governments work together Without finding effective ways to cooperate, the governments will risk failing to develop law and policy that works for Wales. This means that the Sixth Senedd will need to scrutinise how well the Welsh Government is working with the other governments of the UK. It will also need to consider how proposed legislation and common frameworks could develop alignment with, or divergence from, other parts of the UK.  161  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Understanding and influencing intergovernmental working can be difficult. People and businesses can influence each government individually, but monitoring and influencing negotiations between them is more challenging. And parliaments must hold their own governments to account, so scrutiny of intergovernmental working could fall between the cracks. One way to improve scrutiny of intergovernmental working could be increasing interparliamentary cooperation. The Interparliamentary Forum on Brexit (IPF) was set up in 2017 to bring together representatives of committees from UK legislatures. As well as recommending reform of intergovernmental relations, it called for better parliamentary oversight. The IPF last met in September 2019. The Fifth Senedd’s External Affairs and Additional Legislation Committee supported increased interparliamentary working in its legacy report, saying this “offers at least the prospect of occasional scrutiny outcomes that are greater than the sum of their individual parts”. However it chooses to do it, the Sixth Senedd will need not just to hold the Welsh Government to account for how it works across the UK but to articulate and develop its own role in the UK’s constitution.

Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Wales in the new international landscape Over the course of the Fifth Senedd, the Welsh Government and Senedd’s roles in international affairs changed dramatically. The UK’s withdrawal from the EU has reframed the UK’s approach to international engagement and has required increased cooperation between the UK and devolved governments. As a result, the role of the Senedd in the scrutiny of international affairs looks set to increase. Sara Moran and Rhun Davies During the Sixth Senedd, the UK is expected to sign up to a wide range of new international commitments affecting devolved policies and laws. The Senedd’s scrutiny of international commitments matters. International agreements often contain far reaching obligations which can impact on the everyday lives of businesses and people in Wales. The Senedd’s ability to pass laws is also constrained by what the UK Government agrees to on the international stage. The Welsh Government’s ability to deliver its policies is also shaped by these commitments. The UK Government has responsibility for leading negotiations on new agreements but recognises the role the devolved institutions have in implementing agreements in devolved areas. Through careful scrutiny of international agreements, the Senedd has the potential to add value for the benefit of Wales.  What new international agreements can be expected in the Sixth Senedd? A number of new international agreements of significance to Wales are expected over the course of this Sixth Senedd. These include free trade agreements between the UK and the US, New Zealand, Australia and the UK joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). During the Sixth Senedd, the UK is also expected to sign up to new international commitments in the fields of biodiversity, food, the marine environment and climate change. These agreements will sit alongside Wales’ new relationship with Europe.  163  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  The UK Government says that the trade agreements it’s negotiating will present new opportunities for UK businesses, including those in Wales. Increasing UK trade with other countries will likely create losers as well as winners. These new UK agreements could result in Welsh businesses experiencing increased competition from imports, with specific sectors affected differently. For example, a free trade agreement with New Zealand has the potential to have a negative impact on the UK’s agriculture and semi-processed food sectors, as New Zealand has a comparative advantage in these sectors. This is why the Senedd scrutiny of international agreements matters. The Fifth Senedd’s External Affairs and Additional Legislation (EAAL) Committee said: The Senedd has a role in identifying Welsh interests and, through scrutiny and representation, ensuring that agreements are implemented and developed in a way that maximise their benefits to Wales. Potential impact of free trade agreements on Gross Value Added in Wales. Agreement (a scoping assessment for the UK joining the CPTPP has not been published  Change in Wales GVA, long run % change (approximately 15 years)  yet)  UK-US  Increase of 0.05% to <0.15% or 0.25% to <0.40% (depending on the extent of tariff liberalisation and reduction in non-tariff measures)  UK-Australia  Increase of 0.00% to <0.05%  UK-New Zealand  Increase of 0.00% to <0.05%  What role will the new Welsh Government play? For the first time in over forty years, Brexit means that the UK Government is negotiating and joining a number of international agreements with other countries in its own right. The devolution settlement means that the UK Government is responsible for negotiating and entering into international agreements on behalf of the four nations of the UK. However, once agreed, observing and implementing these agreements in devolved areas is a matter for the Welsh Government and Senedd.  164  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  Engagement between the previous Welsh Government and the UK Government on non-EU trade agreement negotiations took place through a then newlyestablished Ministerial Forum for Trade. However, a key Concordat on trade, intended to formalise how the devolved governments can engage in the negotiations themselves, hasn’t yet been agreed. In 2020, a Senedd committee voiced its concern at the delay in finalising these arrangements. The UK Government has also proposed new ways of working for the UK’s four governments across over twenty policy areas (including fisheries, food and the environment) under its new Common Frameworks programme. In part, the programme aims to ensure that the four nations remain in compliance with the UK’s international obligations while also offering new opportunities for the devolved governments to participate in the UK’s international activities, such as representation at international bodies.  How can Sixth Senedd scrutiny of UK international affairs benef it Wales? The Senedd’s approach to international affairs has undoubtedly changed during the Fifth Senedd. The Fifth Senedd’s EAAL Committee developed a dedicated scrutiny process for international agreements The Committee scrutinised over 100 trade and non-trade agreements. It took action by reporting on significant agreements, as well as engaging with the Welsh Government and relevant committees in other UK parliaments on matters of interest to Wales. Examples of the scrutiny of international agreements by EAAL Committee in the Fifth Senedd: Trade agreements: roll-over of EU trade agreements including with Canada, South Korea and Singapore, as well as future new agreements being negotiated such as a potential UK-US trade agreement. Non-trade agreements: citizens’ rights, elections and voting, fisheries, ports, air, road and rail transport, social security, science and research, judicial cooperation, film production and space. Through careful scrutiny, the Sixth Senedd can make a difference in enhancing the value of international agreements to Wales. For example, by giving a voice to Welsh interests in situations where potential barriers to trade and opportunities for improvements are identified.  165  What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd  How can the Welsh Government maximise new opportunities in international affairs? The international context in which the Sixth Senedd and new Welsh Government will operate will have changed significantly compared to the previous Senedd as a result of the UK’s exit from the EU and the economic impact of COVID-19. Against this backdrop, as well as the UK’s evolving international relationships and new international agreements, the Welsh Government will need to consider if and how it wishes to promote Wales and Welsh businesses internationally. In its international strategy, the previous Welsh Government set out its ambition to increase Wales’ profile and influence in the world, as well as to grow the Welsh economy by increasing exports and inward investment. The Welsh Government’s network of 21 international offices are intended to play an important role in promoting Wales internationally. To maximise the opportunities presented by the UK’s new international agreements and changing international context, the new Welsh Government may need to reconsider its international presence, where it’s located, how its relationships with UK Government bodies and departments work and the focus of any strategy.  A new international chapter for Wales? The way in which Welsh interests are reflected in the new international landscape will be a key issue in the Sixth Senedd. There’ll be new international commitments in important devolved areas. Members of the new Senedd will need to understand what they mean for Wales and their constituents. The previous Welsh Government said that the UK’s departure from the EU and the economic impact of COVID-19 means it’s essential for Wales to have a heightened international profile. The new Welsh Government will need to decide whether it shares this view and if so how it will deliver any international ambitions.  166  What’s next?

This is the international United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) conference on climate change held every year and attended by signatory countries and other parties, 196 in total. The UK will host the COP events. The pre-COP Summit and other preparatory events such as a youth event will be held in Italy. The UK and Italian governments have committed to putting climate and nature at the heart of the multilateral agenda in 2021, including through the G7, G20 and COP26 Presidencies. According to the UK Government, COP26 will be the largest summit the UK has ever hosted, with over 30,000 delegates, including world leaders, experts, campaigners and government officials. Further details can be found on the UKCOP26 website. Alok Sharma is President Designate for COP26 having stepped down from his BEIS Ministerial role in January 2020, to work on COP26 full time. Alok Sharma set out the four UK key goals for COP26 in a speech in March 2020: 1.  2. 3. 4.  All countries to submit more ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), committing to further cuts in carbon emissions by 2030. All countries to commit to reach net zero emissions as soon as possible Developed countries to honour their commitments, including meeting the 2020 US$100bn dollar a year goal for climate finance Seeking to agree a package which takes forward the Paris Agreement.  He also provided an update on progress on all the goals to Parliament in a written statement on COP26 on 18 March 2021. A range of bilateral and multilateral meetings and high level events will have taken place throughout 2020 and 2021 in advance of the COP26 meeting. Alok Sharma wrote a letter to all parties on 22 September 2021 in which he set out the remaining discussion that would take place in advance of COP26. The letter also set out the “emerging elements of the COP26 negotiated outcome”. In advance of the COP26, developed countries that have not fully set out the Nationally Determined Contributions are being urged to do so. Developing countries are also calling for commitments on climate finance to be met going forward to 2025.  4  Commons Library Research Briefing, 12 October 2021  COP26: the international climate change conference, Glasgow, UK  1  Background  In November 2021 the UK and Italy will jointly host the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26). This is the international United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) conference on climate change held every year and attended by signatory countries and other parties, 196 in total. The UK will host the COP events. The pre-COP Summit and other preparatory events such as a youth event will be held in Italy. The UNFCCC was adopted during the 1992 Earth Summit, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It entered into force in 1994 and has been ratified by 196 States (including both the EU and the UK) which constitute the “Parties” to the Convention. The objective of the Treaty, set out in article 2 of the Convention, is to “stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.”  1.1  Paris Agreement and 1.5oC target In December 2015, agreement was reached at COP21 in Paris to keep a global temperature rise this century well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5°C. The Paris Agreement entered into force on 4 November 2016 and 191 Parties have ratified the agreement. 1 There have been a number of developments since 2015, including the publication of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and related greenhouse gas emissions pathways in 2018. 2 The IPCC noted that limiting warming to 1.5°C is possible but would require rapid and far-reaching transitions across multiple sectors. In response to this a number of countries, including China and the US have set a net zero emission target. The UK set a legally binding target of net zero emissions by 2050 in 2019. A full list of countries which have set out legally binding or policy commitments on net zero, and by which date are available on the Energy and Climate Information Unit (an independent advisory body) net zero tracker.  1  5  UNFCCC, Paris Agreement – status of ratification [accessed 24 March 2020]  Commons Library Research Briefing, 12 October 2021  COP26: the international climate change conference, Glasgow, UK  In addition to achieving net zero by a certain date, the trajectory emissions take, including when they peak, will also impact future climate impacts. An August 2021 article in The Conversation highlights the fact that in order for the 1.5°C to be met, GHG emissions must peak well in advance of 2050. The COP26 meeting was originally going to be held five years after the Paris Agreement was agreed, in 2020. This was when the Paris Agreement came into effect and was also the year when Parties to the Paris Agreement were expected to put forward enhanced or updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) as part of the so-called “ratchet” mechanism. NDCs set out each Party’s efforts to reduce national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. See section 2.2 below for further details on NDCs. Further information on the Paris Agreement and the IPCC Special Report is available in the Library Briefing on the Climate change conference (COP24), Katowice, Poland. The Commons Library climate change explainers provide further information on the scientific basics of climate change, UK and global emission trends and the history of global climate change negotiations.  1.2  IPCC Sixth Assessment Report published The main function of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is to publish scientific assessments of the global state of climate change every 7 years. Its first report was published in 1990. The first report of its Sixth Assessment, Climate Change 2021: the physical science basis, was published in August 2021.This covers the most up-to-date understanding of climate change science. 3 An IPCC post on the publication stated that changes in climate are being seen in every region and across whole climate systems. It warned that climate change was “widespread, rapid and intensifying” and unprecedented: Many of the changes observed in the climate are unprecedented in thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of years, and some of the changes already set in motion—such as continued sea level rise— are irreversible over hundreds to thousands of years. 4 It also highlighted that significant action could limit impacts and stabilise temperatures: However, strong and sustained reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases would limit climate  3 4  6  IPCC Post, Climate change widespread, rapid, and intensifying – IPCC, 9 August 2021 IPCC Post, Climate change widespread, rapid, and intensifying – IPCC, 9 August 2021  Commons Library Research Briefing, 12 October 2021  COP26: the international climate change conference, Glasgow, UK  change. While benefits for air quality would come quickly, it could take 20-30 years to see global temperatures stabilize. 5 Two further reports are expected in the next few months. The second report is on impacts, adaptation and vulnerability to climate change. The third report is on mitigation of climate change. Mitigation are measures to reduce the emissions and levels in the atmosphere of the greenhouse gases that cause climate change.  1.3  Previous Climate Change COPs COP25 was held in Madrid, Spain under the Presidency of Chile in December 2019. Its key aim was to finalise the “rulebook” of the Paris Agreement by agreeing rules for carbon markets and other forms of international cooperation. However, the talks did not reach consensus or achieve many of the outcomes that were hoped for, instead pushing decisions into COP26 in the UK. UN secretary general António Guterres said he was “disappointed” with the results of COP25 and that “the international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation & finance to tackle the climate crisis.” 6 More information on COP25 is available in the Library Briefing Paper on the Chile Madrid climate change conference: COP25.

However, on 1 April 2020, the UNFCCC, the UK Government and the Italian Government announced that COP26 had been postponed due to Covid-19. The Government press release stated:  IPCC Post, Climate change widespread, rapid, and intensifying – IPCC, 9 August 2021 CarbonBrief, COP25: Key outcomes agreed at the UN climate talks in Madrid, 15 December 2019 7 PQ 20511 [on climate change convention] 2 March 2020 5  6  7  Commons Library Research Briefing, 12 October 2021  COP26: the international climate change conference, Glasgow, UK  Rescheduling will ensure all parties can focus on the issues to be discussed at this vital conference and allow more time for the necessary preparations to take place. We will continue to work with all involved to increase climate ambition, build resilience and lower emissions. 8 New dates of 1 to 12 November 2021 were announced jointly by the UK and Italian Government on 28 May 2020. According to the UK Government, COP26 will be the largest summit the UK has ever hosted, with over 30,000 delegates, including world leaders, experts, campaigners and government officials.

Commons Library Research Briefing, 12 October 2021  COP26: the international climate change conference, Glasgow, UK  2  UK Presidency of COP26  The UK and Italy will jointly host and hold the Presidency of COP26. The priorities for both countries were set out in joint statement in May 2021: During this year of the UK-Italy COP Presidency, we stand together on the need to build back better following the devastating impact of COVID-19. The UK and Italy are committed to putting climate and nature at the heart of the multilateral agenda in 2021, including through the G7, G20 and COP26 Presidencies. Through our Presidencies, we will work closely to achieve progress on the most vital issues of our age and encourage countries to take concrete actions towards our shared climate goals. We are pleased that all G7 countries have now committed to net zero by 2050 at the latest, providing a vital step forward towards reducing global emissions. We now urge all countries to do their part and to take the steps needed to keep the 1.5-degree Celsius temperature limit within reach, including through setting ambitious nationally determined contributions and long-term strategies to cut emissions and reach net zero. 9 The Prime Minister appointed Alok Sharma as the COP26 President designate, alongside his position as Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), in February 2020. 10 The position had previously been held by former energy and clean growth Minister, Claire O’Neill. 11 On 8 January 2021, Alok Sharma stepped down from his ministerial role and was appointed full-time President designate. A Written Statement from 18 March 2021 on providing an update on COP26 summarised what the role entails. It set out the work in the run up to the Conference, including working with participants on increasing commitments in advance of COP26: The COP President-Designate is responsible within the UK for delivering the COP26 summit in Glasgow. Ahead of the summit I am engaging with the UNFCCC Secretariat and the current COP President as they prepare the provisional negotiations agenda. I am working to increase ambition internationally, developing effective international Cabinet Office, Joint statement from COP26 President Alok Sharma and Italian Ecological Transition Minister Roberto Cingolani, 11 May 2021 10 Gov.uk press release, Alok Sharma appointed COP26 President, 13 February 2020 11 Gov.uk press release, An update on the Presidency of UK COP26, 31 January 2020 9  9  Commons Library Research Briefing, 12 October 2021  COP26: the international climate change conference, Glasgow, UK  relationships with countries, institutions, businesses and stakeholders to achieve the necessary commitments in advance of and at COP. I am regularly engaging with the members of the UNFCCC to understand their positions and work with them to reach consensus on the negotiations. I will continue my close engagement with a large number of civil society actors as we seek to deliver an inclusive COP. 12 The statement went onto summarise what the role of the COP President will be during the conference, which will include leading the formal negotiations: With the will of all Parties, I will formally become COP President during the opening ceremony of the Glasgow Summit. At the summit, I will participate as COP President, under the authority of the COP and its 197 parties. I will lead the formal negotiations, preside over meetings and will facilitate proceedings in accordance with the COP’s draft Rules of Procedure. I will have oversight of the overall package of outcomes and will work closely with UNFCCC members to secure consensus. As COP President I will also lead the COP Bureau, which is an 11-member body that assists the President and supports the work of COP, for the duration of my term until COP27 in late 2022. 13 The role of host and president are seen as critical in the run up to COP events in bringing together parties in advance of the meeting, and ensuring progress is made during conferences. The ECIU explained how UK actions would be important in advance of the conference, both nationally and internationally: The UK has an opportunity to take a number of international actions – on diplomacy, trade and investments ­– which could increase the likelihood of a successful outcome at COP26. Thoughtful UK decisions can strengthen other countries’ ability to deliver climate action; but short-sighted decisions can undermine international action and hinder countries’ achievement, for example, of their own NDCs. Scrutiny of the UK actions in the run up to COP26 will be intense, with many complex and sometimes conflicting agendas potentially challenging the diplomatic effort. 14 The Government has set out details of domestic action to date, including its commitment to reduce emissions by 78% by 2035 as part of meeting the sixth carbon budget and achieving net-zero by 2050. This also included a commitment to publishing a cross-departmental Net Zero Strategy before COP26.

Promises made to developing countries are kept, especially the pledge by developed nations to mobilize $100 billion in climate finance annually by 2020. 2. Governments wrap up outstanding items and negotiations to fully implement the Paris Agreement. 3. Countries lower emissions and raise climate ambition, not only with regard to emission reductions, but also increasing ambition in adapting and building resilience to the impacts of climate change. 4. No voice or solution is left behind, through re-engaging with observers and Non-Party Stakeholders in a unity of purpose. Ms. Espinosa said she is encouraged by the growing momentum for climate action among both governments and non-State actors 15. Alok Sharm, as President designate, also set out four key goals in March 2020 for the UK at COP26: • • • •  All countries to submit more ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions, committing to further cuts in carbon emissions by 2030. All countries to commit to reach net zero emissions as soon as possible Developed countries to honour their commitments, including meeting the 100-billion-dollar goal for climate finance Seeking to agree a package which takes forward the Paris Agreement. 16  Mr Sharma also highlighted the following areas as needing particular action in the run up to the conference: • • • •  15 16  11  Adaptation and resilience to climate change. Nature Energy transition Accelerating the move towards zero carbon road transport  UNFCCC, Patricia Espinosa Outlines the Four Keys to Success at COP26, 3 February 2021 Gov.uk speech, COP26 President Alok Sharma’s briefing to UN member states, published 8 March 2020  Commons Library Research Briefing, 12 October 2021  COP26: the international climate change conference, Glasgow, UK  •  Unleashing finance to support the goals of the Paris Agreement  This was followed in June 2020 by a speech setting out the five themes that would be the focus of the UK’s preparatory work: clean energy; clean transport; nature-based solutions; adaptation and finance 17 The Government has set out more detail on the goals and what needs to be achieved at the conference on the UK COP 26 website. On delivering net zero by 2050 through NDCs it sets out that countries will need to “accelerate the phaseout of coal, encourage investment in renewables, curtail deforestation and speed up the switch to electric vehicles”. 18 It also calls for efforts to protect communities and nature from the already inevitable climate change impacts that are expected by: • •  Protecting and restoring ecosystems Building defences, putting warning systems in place and making infrastructure and agriculture more resilient to avoid loss of homes, livelihoods and lives.  Developed countries pledged at the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Conference pledge to mobilise at least US$100bn a year in climate finance for developing countries (from public and private sources), by 2020. The UK has called on developed countries to make good on this commitment (see section 2.2 below for further details on progress), and stated that: International financial institutions must play their part and we need work towards unleashing the trillions in private and public sector finance required to secure global net zero. 19 In addition, the COP26 conference “must finalise the Paris rulebook” and accelerate collaboration between governments, business and civil society. The Paris rulebook refers to implementation guidelines for NDCs, which have proved difficult to agree and have not yet been finalised. 20  Priorities for the negotiations As part of its presidency role the UK Government has engaged with other countries on their priorities for agreement at COP26. It has set out the most commonly raised issues, which include the following: •  Enabling ambition through carbon markets  •  Rules for the transparent reporting of action and support  UNFCCC, COP Presidencies Speak at Launch of Race to Zero Campaign, 5 June 2020 UKCop26.org, What do we need to achieve at COP26?

Preparatory work Historically, reaching agreement at climate change COPs has required a significant amount of work before the conferences begin to reach a degree of consensus amongst all parties on the proposed text for any agreement. The UNFCC Road to Glasgow website sets out the range of meetings that have been taking place, for the most part remotely, to work on the various topics. There are also monthly multilateral informal consultations by the COP25 Presidency and the COP26 incoming Presidency, at ministerial, country delegation and technical levels. Summaries of each of these meetings are available on the UNFCC website. Alok Sharma set out the work he was involved with as part of this process in a debate on COP26 in the House of Commons on 10 March 2021: I, of course, am now working full time on COP26. I have personally engaged with Ministers in more than 50 Governments, including recently with India’s Prime Minister Modi, US special envoy John Kerry, who was here on Monday for discussions with us, and China’s special envoy for climate change, Minister Xie Zhenhua. Of course, we will work with like-minded colleagues around the world to deliver at Glasgow. I speak regularly with negotiating group chairs and chief negotiators, the United Nations, development banks, civil society groups and business. In recent weeks, I have also made a number of international visits, where I have always felt well  21  13  UKCop26, Negotiations [website visited 21 July 2021]  Commons Library Research Briefing, 12 October 2021  COP26: the international climate change conference, Glasgow, UK  supported by the UK Government network. All in all, we are well resourced for COP. 22 Alok Sharma also gave evidence to the Environmental Audit Committee on 11 March 2021, where he provided further detail on work to agree a Paris rulebook: The issue, as you have quite rightly identified, is what we are doing— apart from asking for these commitments on mitigation and adaptation and so on—to close off the elements of the Paris rulebook. We are talking about negotiations across 197 countries. We have a negotiating team, which is working day and night on this issue. From a time zone perspective, they are literally working day and night on this issue. I have a regular dialogue with the chairs of the negotiating groups that are part of the UNFCCC process. We are looking to make headway through the various mandates we have been given. One issue we have is that we are not able to meet in person in the same way that would have been possible previously. We are looking to see how those discussions move forward in a virtual or hybrid setting. There is this idea that, somehow, we are sitting on our hands and that the process of discussing the issues is not happening. It most certainly is. 23 Details of the various meetings and bilateral discussions being held by the Alok Sharma are available on the COP26 pages. These include, for example, recent bilateral discussions during visits to Austria, Barbados, Turkey and Russia, and plans to visit Slovenia and Italy in advance of the G20 Climate and Energy Minister’s meeting. In addition, there are a series of international meetings and events that have taken place over the last year and that are due take place in advance of the meeting in Glasgow and feed into the discussions there. A Presidency Programme for COP26 setting out the programme for November was published on 7 July 2021 and is available on the UKCOP26 website.  2.2  Progress to date In a written statement from 18 March 2021 Alok Sharma provided a summary of progress in the efforts to reach agreement on the four goals he set out for the Conference:  Reducing emissions: countries representing around 65% of global CO2 emissions and around 70% of the world’s economy have now committed to reaching net zero emissions or carbon neutrality. When the UK took the role of incoming COP Presidency in December 2019,  22 23  14  HC Deb 10 March 2021 c932 Environmental Audit Committee, Oral evidence: Preparation for COP26, HC 222, 11 March 2021  Commons Library Research Briefing, 12 October 2021  COP26: the international climate change conference, Glasgow, UK  coverage was just 20% of global emissions and 26% of world GDP. On 12th December, over 90 countries, businesses, sectors, cities, including 75 world leaders, attended the Climate Ambition Summit, co-hosted with the UN and France in partnership with Italy and Chile. At the summit 45 leaders highlighted plans for new and more ambitious NDCs (covering 71 countries including all EU member states) and 24 countries announced new commitments, strategies or plans to reach net zero or carbon neutrality. The Summit delivered real steps forward - for example Colombia committed to an impressive 51% emissions reduction target; and Pakistan announced a moratorium on new coal plants.  On helping protect communities and natural habitats from the impact of climate change: at the CAS, 20 countries put forward  plans for protecting their economies and communities from the impact of climate change. On 25 January we launched the Adaptation Action Coalition to bring together countries to identify the solutions, technologies and resources needed to protect people and nature as the planet warms. Action on nature is at the heart of our COP Presidency. At the UN General Assembly in September 2020 the Prime Minister signed the Leaders’ Pledge for Nature committing leaders to take ten urgent actions to put nature on a path to recovery by 2030. The UK played a key role in pioneering and negotiating the Pledge, and which now has over 80 countries signed up. On 2 February 2021 we launched the Forest, Agriculture and Commodity Trade (FACT) Dialogue, which will bring together key countries exporting agricultural products and the countries consuming these products to agree global principles and a roadmap of actions to make global supply chains process greener and more sustainable, tackling one of the primary drivers of nature loss.  On increasing climate finance: there is an urgent need to get more  finance flowing to support swift climate action. Developed countries must meet and surpass the $100bn of climate finance commitment, matching UK ambition to double UK ICF to at least £11.6 billion between 2021 and 2025. Private finance is also key. So far we have seen major asset owners, representing over $5 trillion, and asset managers, representing over $9 trillion, commit to net zero targets by 2050. Climate-related Financial Disclosures are increasing and jurisdictions in Brazil, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Switzerland are taking action to make disclosure mandatory, complementing the UK’s announcement for a pathway to mandatory disclosure across the economy by 2025.  On making progress on the outstanding elements of the Paris Rulebook, and accelerating delivery of the Paris Goals: we have  been convening UNFCCC members in discussions to lay the groundwork for the negotiations, and we will be hosting, alongside Chile, a series of monthly multilateral consultations. More broadly, we have built partnerships to increase international collaboration on  15  Commons Library Research Briefing, 12 October 2021  COP26: the international climate change conference, Glasgow, UK  key issues, establishing the Energy Transition Council and Zero Emissions Vehicles Transition Council, as well as working through existing coalitions: the Powering Past Coal Alliance has grown to 114 members covering 20% of OECD coal power capacity. 24 Since then, a Climate and Development Ministerial was held on 31 March 2021. This covered access to finance, together with the quantity, quality and composition of any finance; the response to climate impacts; and the impact of Covid-19 on finance and debt sustainability. There is also an agreed Climate and Development Ministerial pathway setting out future discussions. An annual (intersessional) meeting of the UNFCCC normally takes place in Bonn in June, halfway between two COPs. This year it took place between 31 May and 17 June, as a virtual meeting on an informal basis. The UNFCC summarised the issues covered during the meeting: Issues discussed in preparation for COP26 included making agriculture more sustainable, how best to take stock of progress of climate actions, fulfilling pre-2020 commitments, support to developing countries, and building resilience and adapting to the effects of climate change. There are still diverging views on finalizing the details of how the Paris Agreement’s carbon market and non-market mechanisms will work. While diverging views also remain on finalizing the details that will allow all countries to communicate their climate actions transparently under the Paris Agreement, progress was made on the tools needed to bring the transparency arrangements to life. Other crunch issues that need to be resolved at COP26 include delivering the pledge to mobilize 100 billion dollars annually to support developing countries, raising ambition on emission reductions, adaptation and finance while ensuring that no voice remains unheard and no proposal unattended. 25 However, specialist website CarbonBrief produced a summary of the meeting concluding that “discussions were marred by technical difficulties and made little progress on most of the key issues, with an unmet $100bn pledge on climate finance looming over the talks”. 26 A COP Ministerial meeting took place at the end of July with an agenda covering five topics: scaling up adaptation; keeping 1.5°C alive; loss and damage; finalising the Paris Rulebook; and mobilising finance.27 A summary of the meeting was published and provides a good overview of the range of views on what commitments should be made at COP26.

Further information is available on the UNFCCC pages on nationally determined contributions. NDCs were first submitted by Parties in 2015. To date 190 of 196 parties to the Convention, including the EU Member States, have submitted their first NDCs. Parties were expected to put forward enhanced or updated NDCs in 2020. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) published an initial NDC Synthesis Report on Friday 26 February 2021. The report provides an overview of the 48 new or updated NDCs representing 75 Parties, submitted by 31 December 2020. A final version of the report is expected to be published before COP26. The report concluded that the sum of NDC submitted would mean that by 2030 global greenhouse gas emissions would be 0.7 per cent lower than in 1990, 0.5 per cent lower than in 2010 and 2.1 per cent lower than in 2017. However, it noted this was not anything near enough to achieve the long-term target of net zero emissions by 2050: […] to be consistent with global emission pathways with no or limited overshoot of the 1.5 °C goal, global net anthropogenic CO2 emissions need to decline by about 45 per cent from the 2010 level by 2030, reaching net zero around 2050. For limiting global warming to below 2 °C, CO emissions need to decrease by about 25 per cent from the 2010 level by 2030 and reach net zero around 2070. Deep reductions are required for nonCO2 emissions as well. Thus, the estimated reductions referred to in paragraphs […] above fall far short of what is required, demonstrating the need for Parties to further strengthen their mitigation commitments under the Paris Agreement. 29 CarbonBrief produced an analysis of which countries met the UN’s 2020 deadline to raise ‘climate ambition’, examining NDCs of the 45 “parties” (44 countries, plus the EU’s 27 member states viewed as one bloc) that met this deadline. It noted that although some parties such as the UK and EU, have increased ambitions, many others restated existing ambitions and, in some cases, ambitions were decreased. 30  Article 4, para 2 UNFCC, Nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement, 26 February 2021 30 CarbonBrief, Which countries met the UN’s 2020 deadline to raise ‘climate ambition’, 8 January 2021 28  29  17  Commons Library Research Briefing, 12 October 2021  COP26: the international climate change conference, Glasgow, UK  UK NDC The UK is a party to the UNFCCC and has ratified the Paris Agreement separately to the EU. However, until 2020 the EU had an overall NDC on behalf of its Members States, including the UK, acting jointly to deliver an overarching commitment. The UK Government confirmed in February 2020 plans to bring “forward its own, increased NDC well ahead of COP26” following the UK’s departure from the EU. 31 The UK’s independent adviser on climate change, the Climate Change Committee (CCC) published its advice to Government on setting NDC’s on 3 December 2020. Its key recommendations included setting a target for reducing UK territorial emissions by at least 68% by 2030. However, the CCC cautioned this would not be enough and called for a policy package and a Net Zero strategy for the UK: The NDC is more than just a number. It should be accompanied by wider climate commitments, including the development of a policy package and Net Zero Strategy to deliver against the UK goal, clear commitments to reduce international aviation and shipping emissions, and greater support for climate finance, particularly for developing countries. It is also imperative that the NDC is accompanied by strengthened climate change adaptation plans – with new commitments – for the UK to show its leadership on emissions reduction and adaptation. 32 The Government followed this by announcing on 4 December 2020 that it had increased the UK ambition in its NDC of cutting emissions from 53% to 68% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. Details were set out in a Written Statement on 7 December: On Friday 4 December the Prime Minister announced the UK’s new Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement. This commits the UK to a new ambitious target to reduce the UK’s emissions by at least 68% by the end of the decade, compared to 1990 levels. This is a step forward in our ambition to tackle climate change over the next ten years as we accelerate towards meeting our legallybinding commitment to reach net zero by 2050. Just as the UK led the way as the first major economy to legislate for net zero, our NDC raises the bar for global climate ambition by committing the UK to the highest level of emissions reductions by 2030 of any major economy, compared to 1990 levels. The level of the UK’s NDC is consistent with advice from the independent Climate Change Committee (CCC). It is a significant step up from the level of the UK’s previous target as a contributor to the EU’s NDC, which was 31 32  18  PQ 12820 [on climate change] 14 February 2020 CCC, Advice on the UK’s 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), 3 December 2020  Commons Library Research Briefing, 12 October 2021  COP26: the international climate change conference, Glasgow, UK  equivalent to around a 53% UK reduction over the same time period. 33 Full details of the UK’s NDC can be found in its official submission to the UNFCCC. In the lead up to the conference there were calls form some developing countries for the G20 countries, meeting in Italy on 12 October, to strengthen their targets on cutting greenhouse gas emissions and provisions on climate finance 34. In advance of the G20 meeting, Alok Sharma also called for China, India and Saudi Arabia, together with Australia, to strengthen their NDCs. He stated it was incumbent on them to deliver enhanced and more ambitious climate targets before COP26. 35  Climate Finance In 2009, at the fifteenth conference of the parties (COP15 ) of the UN Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC) in Copenhagen climate finance funding of $100 billion a year by 2020 was agreed. Climate finance would be delivered by Annex I countries of the UNFCCC agreement non-Annex I countries. The finance is to fund climate change mitigation, which are measures to reduce greenhouse emissions, and adaptation to climate change. Funding can come from public and private sources and be provided in different forms. The $100bn commitments were reiterated at COP 16 in Cancun in 2010, and at COP21 in Paris in 2015, where it was agreed to extend the commitment to provide $100bn every year to 2025. Final figures will not be available until 2022 but it is generally accepted that the 2020 goal has not been fully be met This, together with what form climate finance takes (loans or grants), is a key area of contention for developing countries in the run up to COP26. The variety of the sources of this funding have made it difficult to monitor progress, but a review commissioned by the UN concluded in December 2020 that target will be missed. An article in Nature Climate Change expressed the view that “if this failure is confirmed, it will likely lead to [a] further erosion of trust between developed and developing countries”. 36 Ensuring the $100bn pledge is met going forward is one of the four goals of the UK’s COP26 presidency. Alok Sharma, has said that although $100bn is  Written Statement, The UK’s new Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), 7 December 2020 The Observer, Give us action on climate not just words, say developing nations ahead of Cop26, 9 October 2021 35 Financial Times, UK COP chief challenges G20 climate laggards over failure to improve, 11 October 2021 [subscription required] 36 Nature Climate Change, Rebooting a failed promise of climate finance, 18 February 2021 33  34  19  Commons Library Research Briefing, 12 October 2021  COP26: the international climate change conference, Glasgow, UK  just a fraction of the investment needed to tackle the climate crisis, delivering it is a matter of maintaining trust. In 2019, The UK increased its commitment to £11.6bn in the next four years. In recent months the US, Germany and Canada have also increased their pledges. Recent reports are that total pledges are currently $10bn short of the target, but that countries such as Sweden, Norway and Spain are expected to increase their contributions. Private finance The former Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, was appointed as the Finance Adviser to the Prime Minister for COP26 and UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance on 16 January 2020. 37 Further details of work in this area in the run up to COP26 are set out in Building a private finance system for net zero: Priorities for private finance for COP26 published by Mark Carney in November 2020. In addition, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero was launched in April 2021, chaired by Mark Carney with the aim of accelerating the transition to net-zero: The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), chaired by Mark Carney, UN Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance, brings together over 160 firms (together responsible for assets in excess of $70 trillion1) from the leading net zero initiatives across the financial system to accelerate the transition to net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest. All GFANZ member alliances must be accredited by the UN Race to Zero campaign. They must use science-based guidelines to reach net zero emissions, cover all emission scopes, include 2030 interim target setting, and commit to transparent reporting and accounting in line with the UN Race to Zero criteria. 43 banks from 23 countries (with assets of $28.5 trillion) form the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) today - which joins GFANZ - with its members committing to align operational and attributable emissions from their portfolios with pathways to net-zero by 2050 or sooner. 38 More recently Alok Sharma gave a speech on 11 July 2021 at the Venice G20 Climate Conference, organised by the Italian finance ministry and central bank. The speech focused on the role of Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) in delivering climate finance, including scaling up private finance: I urge MDBs and private financial firms to increase their collaboration, and scale-up blended finance initiatives and technical  Bank of England, Mark Carney appointed by Prime Minister as finance adviser for COP26, 16 January 2020 [accessed 23 March 2020] 38 UNFCCC, New Financial Alliance for Net Zero Emissions Launches, 21 April 2021 37  20  Commons Library Research Briefing, 12 October 2021  COP26: the international climate change conference, Glasgow, UK  assistance, and to improve the conditions for investment within countries, and build pipelines of high-quality, bankable projects. Together, you can demonstrate that public finance can de-risk investment and leverage in significant private capital. So, ahead of COP, I encourage MDBs to share plans for mobilising private finance faster, and I urge private financial institutions to work with MDBs on these plans, to help show how finance will flow in support of countries’ ambitious plans for climate action. Such steps are essential if we are to redirect the sums flowing through the global economy towards our green future, and secure the trillions of dollars required to build resilience, meet global net zero, and keep the 1.5 degree limit alive. 39  Least Developed Countries view Finance is one of the areas of contention between developed and developing countries. Developing countries are concerned that they will be asked to commit to costly measures to address climate change, when their historic emissions are low; and that they are likely to suffer more severe impacts from climate change without the finance available to adapt to them. A meeting of the UNFCCC grouping of Least Developed Countries (LDCs) held in advance of COP22 (in July 2021) published Delivering the Paris Agreement: a five point plan for solidarity, fairness and prosperity which called for much stronger action from developed countries: We lay out five areas in which all governments, especially those of nations that became prosperous through the untrammelled burning of fossil fuels, need to deliver on their promises before and during COP26: Cutting emissions: despite welcome recent progress, the sum total of climate policies in place across the world will not keep global warming within the limits that governments agreed in Paris; an acceleration that is consistent with the 1.5 degree Celsius temperature limit is urgently needed, led by those with the biggest responsibility and capacity Adaptation: with climate impacts increasing, provisions to help the most vulnerable adapt, including through increased financial support, need to be strengthened Loss and Damage: the consequences of the developed world’s historical failure to cut their emissions adequately are already resulting in losses and damage for the most vulnerable.  39  21  Cabinet Office, Moving finance towards our clean, green, and resilient future, 11 July 2021  Commons Library Research Briefing, 12 October 2021  COP26: the international climate change conference, Glasgow, UK  Responsibilities have to be acknowledged and promised measures delivered Finance: The promises made in Copenhagen in 2009 and again in the Paris Agreement are unequivocal, and must be delivered: at least $100bn per year by 2020, up to 2024, with a concrete delivery plan, with at least half going to adaptation, with increased annual sums from 2025. The debt consequences of Covid-19 mean that action outside the UN climate process is also essential Implementation: After several summits of stalling, governments must by COP26 finalise rules on transparency, carbon trading and common timeframes for accelerating action, in a way that safeguards development and nature. 40  2.3  Emerging elements for the negotiations Alok Sharma wrote a letter to all parties on 22 September 2021 in which he set out the remaining discussion that would take place in advance of COP26. The letter also set out the “emerging elements of the COP26 negotiated outcome”. The list covered a number of areas including: •  •  • •  On finance achieving the $100bn climate finance target; and agreeing a framework for climate finance beyond 2025. In addition, reviewing and issuing guidance to multilateral agencies on funding provision. Addressing the gaps on NDCs, including how to strengthen NDCs for 2030, through the global stocktake of NDCs that is due to take place in 2023. In addition, agreement on a common timeframe for signatories to produce the NDCs. Work on further commitments from countries to netzero are also highlighted. Continue to work to prioritise adaptation and increase the focus on loss and damage Further work on the Paris Rulebook and an enhanced transparency framework, to give confidence in climate commitments and allow comparisons. 41  The full list is available on the UK COP26 website. In a speech to the UN General Assembly on 22 September 2021 the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, called COP26 a turning point for humanity, which needs to “grow up” and listen to the warnings of scientists. He stated that LDCs, Delivering the Paris Agreement: a five-point plan for solidarity, fairness and prosperity July 2021 41 Alok Sharma, Letter to all parties from the cop26 president designate, ahead of pre-cop, 22 September 2021 40  22  Commons Library Research Briefing, 12 October 2021  COP26: the international climate change conference, Glasgow, UK  countries “need to pledge collectively to achieve carbon neutrality – net zero”. He also highlighted the four areas where commitments needed to be made: If we are to stave off these hikes in temperature we must go further and faster – we need all countries to step up and commit to very substantial reductions by 2030 – and I passionately believe that we can do it by making commitments in four areas – coal, cars, cash and trees. 42 Alok Sharma also gave a speech on 30 September to the Youth4Climate conference which took place during the Ministerial pre-COP meeting in Milan, in which he said that the youth delegates spoke the truth “we need to do much, much more much faster. 43  42 43  23  Prime Minister’s Office, PM speech at the UN General Assembly, 22 September 2021 Alok Sharma, Home truths on climate delivered ahead of COP26, 30 September 2021  Commons Library Research Briefing, 12 October 2021  The House of Commons Library is a research and information service based in the UK Parliament.

[13. 2021_devolved-COP26] Debate Pack  General debate on the Role and the response of the devolved administrations to COP26  Number CDP-0144 (2021) By Dominic Carver, Alex Adcock 15 September 2021  1  Background  2  2  Devolved administrations  5  2.1  Scotland  5  2.2  Wales  6  2.3  Northern Ireland  7  3  Press  9  4  Parliamentary material  10  4.1  UK Parliament  10  4.2  Scottish Parliament  16  4.3  Welsh Parliament  17  4.4  Northern Ireland Assembly  18  General debate on the Role and the response of the devolved administrations to COP26  1  Background This autumn, the United Kingdom, in partnership with Italy, is hosting the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow. The event will run from 31 October to 12 November 2021. This is the international United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) conference on climate change held every year and attended by signatory countries and other parties, 196 in total. COP26 will be the largest summit the UK has ever hosted, with over 30,000 delegates, including world leaders, experts, campaigners and government officials. 1 Further details on the event can be found on the UKCOP26 website. The Commons Library briefing COP26: the international climate change conference, published in July 2021, also contains further background information and details on the UK’s presidency, COP26 priorities and progress. The Library’s Climate Change overview page also provides further links to UK climate change policy and parliamentary material.  UK Climate Change Policy and Devolved Responsibilities The UK as a whole is signatory and party to the UNFCCC and other international treaties. However, climate change mitigation and adaptation policy is devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Climate Change Act 2008 was introduced as “an Act to set a target for the year 2050 for the reduction of targeted greenhouse gas emissions.” The Act included a statutory target of an 80% reduction in UK greenhouse gas emissions (relative to 1990 levels) by 2050. The Act also led to the establishment of the Climate Change Committee (CCC), an independent, statutory body responsible for advising the UK and devolved governments on emissions targets. The CCC also reports to Parliament on progress made in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and preparing for and adapting to the impacts of climate change. In May 2019, the CCC recommended that the UK as a whole should amend the Act’s decarbonisation target to be net zero on all greenhouse gases by 2050. However, the Committee recommended different dates for different devolved nations; “Scotland should set a net zero Greenhous Gas target for 2045 and Wales should target a 95% reduction by 2050.” 2 The Climate Change Act 2008 (2050 Target Amendment) Order 2019 (the 2019 amendment Order) amends Section 1 of the Climate Change Act 2008 to  1 2  2  United Nations Environment Programme, UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) Climate Change Committee, Net Zero – The UK’s contribution to stopping global warming, 2 May 2019  Commons Library Debate Pack, 15 September 2021  General debate on the Role and the response of the devolved administrations to COP26  change the target for the net UK carbon account from at least 80% lower than the 1990 baseline to at least 100% lower. It came into force on 27 June 2019. The Sixth Carbon Budget, published by the Climate Change Committee (CCC) in December 2020, highlighted that “UK climate targets cannot be met without strong policy action across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, tailored for national, regional and local needs.” The report also noted that “frameworks in Wales and Scotland are ahead of the rest of the UK.” 3 The report stated that: While some important policy levers are held in Westminster, powers are fully or partially devolved in most key areas, including encouraging shifts to walking, cycling and public transport; providing electric vehicle charging points; improvements to the efficiency and comfort of the building stock and heating in homes off the gas grid; agriculture and land use; waste; carbon trading; and public provision of education and training. Northern Ireland also has wider devolved powers over energy networks. The frameworks in Wales and Scotland are ahead of the rest of the UK in emphasising the importance of the potential health and environment benefits, and the need for a just transition. Wales’ Wellbeing of Future Generations Act and Scotland’s Just Transition Commission will be important in ensuring this. Even where the main policy levers are held by the UK Government, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can take action through complementary measures at the devolved level (e.g. provision of additional incentives, public engagement, and supporting policies such as planning and consenting). 4 The latest report from the CCC on progress in reducing emissions, published in June 2021, highlights that Scotland has decarbonised faster than the rest of the UK largely due to decarbonisation in the power sector. However, the report emphasised the increasingly important role of the devolved administration in tackling change as efforts move beyond the power sector: The governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will have an increasingly important role to play in tackling climate change as progress extends beyond the power sector and into sectors where key powers are devolved. As UK-wide emissions reductions extend beyond the power sector, the next decade presents an opportunity for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to match or exceed UK Government action in key devolved areas  3 4  3  Climate Change Committee, Sixth Carbon Budget, December 2020 Climate Change Committee, Sixth Carbon Budget, December 2020  Commons Library Debate Pack, 15 September 2021  General debate on the Role and the response of the devolved administrations to COP26  such as agriculture, tree planting, waste management, buildings efficiency, and public transport. 5  COP 26 Coordination A statement made by the COP26 President-Designate, Alok Sharma, in March 2021, provided an update on the work being done towards the summit and the objectives of the UK Presidency. On domestic and devolved administration engagement the statement provided the following information: We are working with the Scottish Government, the Welsh Government and the Northern Ireland Executive to ensure an inclusive and ambitious summit for the whole of the UK. All parts of the UK will have important roles to play in ensuring the summit’s success. I have invited climate change Ministers from the Scottish Government, the Welsh Government and the Northern Ireland Executive to participate in a regular Devolved Administrations Group to ensure effective engagement and collaboration on COP26 in support of the delivery of an inclusive and welcoming COP26 representative of the whole of the UK. I also chair the COP26 UK Mayors’ and Regions Advisory Council with mayors and council leaders from across the UK, including Glasgow, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast. In addition to ongoing engagement with stakeholders across the UK, to ensure an inclusive, whole of society COP26, that is representative of all of the UK in Glasgow. 6 For further details please refer to the full written statement.  5 6  4  Climate Change Committee, 2021 Progress Report to Parliament, 24 June 2021 Statement UIN HCWS858, COP26 Update, 18 March 2021  Commons Library Debate Pack, 15 September 2021  General debate on the Role and the response of the devolved administrations to COP26  2  Devolved administrations The following sections of the debate pack provide links to briefings and reports on climate change mitigation and policy in the devolved administrations.  2.1  Scotland A briefing paper on COP26 - An Introduction to the UN Conference of the Parties, published by the Scottish Parliamentary Information Centre (SPICe) provides information on COP26 and includes a section on UK and Scottish policy on climate change. This sets out the following: The Climate Change (Emissions Reduction Targets) (Scotland) Act 2019 amends the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 and sets a GHG emissions reduction target (against a 1990 baseline) of net-zero emissions by 2045. This is in line with advice from the CCC, is five years ahead of the UK target, and reflects Scotland’s greater relative capacity to remove emissions than the UK as a whole, due to a larger land area per person and significant carbon dioxide (the main GHG) storage potential through trees and peatland. Interim targets have also been set for reductions of: •  75% by 2030.  •  90% by 2040.  The 2009 Act also requires the Scottish Government to produce a plan setting out proposals and policies for meeting future emissions reduction targets. Known as the Climate Change Plan (CCP), it is published every five years and generally covers a 15 year timespan. The most recent CCP was published in 2018, and covers the period out to 2032. An update to the most recent CCP sets out Scotland's path, across eight key sectors, to achieving a 75% reduction in emissions by 2030, and ultimately net-zero emissions by 2045. The update is a crucial staging post in Scotland's trajectory to netzero, as it encompasses the interim 2030 target, which the CCC consider to be "extremely challenging". 7 The final section of the SPICe briefing paper provides details of Scottish Parliament’s involvement at COP26 which include hosting an international summit and a series of other events.  7  5  SPICe, COP26 - An Introduction to the UN Conference of the Parties, 31 May 2021  Commons Library Debate Pack, 15 September 2021  General debate on the Role and the response of the devolved administrations to COP26  Further information on climate change, the role of Scottish Parliament and achieving targets is available on the Climate Change – Subject Profile page on the Scottish Parliament website. The Scottish Government page on Climate Change provides the latest news and information on policy which may be useful. In March 2019, the Scottish Affairs Committee launched an inquiry into renewable energy in Scotland. Information on the inquiry page states that it is likely to examine the following:  2.2  •  how ‘net-zero’ targets can be met by development of renewable energy in Scotland;  •  the technologies that would best serve Scotland and how challenges in their development can be overcome;  •  employment potential of renewables in Scotland and how a ‘just transition’ for oil and gas workers can be achieved; and  •  how the UK and Scottish Governments can work together to reach their green goals. 8  Wales The article Climate change: the path to zero emissions published by Senedd Research in May 2021 provides an overview of Welsh policy and legislation for achieving net zero and the progress to date. This states that: In 2019 the CCC advised the Welsh Government to amend its 2050 target and reduce emissions by 95% by that date. The Welsh Government accepted this advice and declared its ambition to achieve net-zero by 2050. Revised advice from the CCC in December 2020 recommended that Wales should set and pursue the more ambitious net-zero by 2050 target. In February 2021 the Welsh Government laid four further sets of regulations. These:  8 9  6  •  amended the 2050 emissions target to net-zero;  •  increased the 2030 target to 63% (from 45%) and the 2040 target to 89% (from 67%), and;  •  set the third carbon budget (2026-2030). 9  Scottish Affairs Committee, Renewable energy in Scotland, Senedd Research, Climate change: the path to zero emissions, 18 May 2021  Commons Library Debate Pack, 15 September 2021  General debate on the Role and the response of the devolved administrations to COP26  The article also provides an overview of the Welsh Government’s progress on working towards its emissions targets. Emissions of greenhouse gases in Wales have fallen by 31% since 1990. The most recent data shows that Welsh emissions fell by 8% in 2018, and between 2016 and 2018 they reduced by close to 20%. As things stand, it looks like Wales is on track to meet its 2020 emissions target of a 27% reduction against the 1990 baseline, as long as emissions didn’t increase in 2019 and 2020. This won’t be confirmed until the data is available later this year. 10 Further details on the emissions reductions across different sectors and an analysis of how effect current measures are is provide in the full article which can be read here. In Autumn 2021, the Welsh Government is set to publish its second statutory decarbonisation plan (LCDP2). A report outlining the approach to engagement for delivering LCDP 2 contains further information. .  2.3  Northern Ireland In May 2021, the Research and Information Service (RaISe) published a briefing paper on the Climate Change (Northern Ireland) Bill 2021, a Private Members Bill introduced to the Northern Ireland Assembly on 22 March 2021 . This provides an overview of climate change legislation and policy in Northern Ireland (NI) and highlights that NI currently does not have specific climate change legislation and targets. However, the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs has conducted a consultation on possible proposals for a NI Climate Change Act (December 2020-February 2021). The UK Climate Change Act 2008 (which sets the UK wide decarbonisation target of net zero by 2050) extends to Northern Ireland and whilst there are no specific targets for NI it is implicit that NI contributes to the UK effort under the Act. Under this Act, NI is also required to produce a Climate Change Adaptation Programme (NICCAP) “setting out the objectives, the proposals and policies for meeting those objectives including time scales for their introduction, so to address the relevant risks specific to NI identified in the most recent UK-wide Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA).” 11 The first NI CCAP was published in 2014. NICCAP2 covers 2019-2024, it focuses “on priority areas which have been identified in the NI Evidence Report as requiring urgent adaptation action over the next five years. Focus is also on those adaptation actions which will make the most impact” and “sets the  10 11  7  Senedd Research, Climate change: the path to zero emissions, 18 May 2021 DAERA, Northern Ireland Climate Change Adaptation Programme 2019-2024, 20 September 2019  Commons Library Debate Pack, 15 September 2021  General debate on the Role and the response of the devolved administrations to COP26  strategies, policies and actions by which government departments will deliver on the agreed outcome objectives.” 12 Section 1.2 of the RaISe briefing paper provides a further overview of climate change policy in NI which includes links to the following documents: •  The Draft Programme for Government Framework  •  New Decade, New Approach  •  NI Greenhouse Gas Reduction Strategy and Action Plan 2011  A RaISe briefing on Northern Ireland and Net Zero published in March 2021 contains further information on net zero targets across the UK which may be useful.  12  8  DAERA, Northern Ireland Climate Change Adaptation Programme 2019-2024, 20 September 2019  Commons Library Debate Pack, 15 September 2021  General debate on the Role and the response of the devolved administrations to COP26  3  Press Belfastlive, 13 September 2021 COP26 representation and Climate Bill Northern Ireland at risk if DUP collapse Stormont warns SDLP leader Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK and Ireland that doesn't have legislation on the climate crisis  Scotsman, 25 July 2021 Climate change: How Scotland can play a key role at vital Cop26 summit – Stop Climate Chaos Scotland  Scotsman, 7 July 2021 Emails reveal tensions between Scottish and UK governments over COP26  Scotsman, 18 June 2021 UK's COP26 president Alok Sharma under fire over 'lax' attitude towards global climate talks in Glasgow  Herald, 15 June 2021 SNP minister admits missed emissions target 'wake-up call'  BBC News, 3 February 2021 Climate change: Wales 'must take advantage of COP26'  9  Commons Library Debate Pack, 15 September 2021  General debate on the Role and the response of the devolved administrations to COP26  4  Parliamentary material  4.1  UK Parliament House of Commons Debate COP26 Conference Priorities Parliamentary proceedings | 699 cc496-473WH Thursday 22 July 2021  PQs Ethics and Human Rights: Climate Change Asked by: Steven Bonnar (Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill) (SNP) | Party: Scottish National Party What preparations he has made for discussion at COP26 of (a) ethics and (b) human rights matters relating to climate change. Answered by: The Minister for Business, Energy and Clean Growth (AnneMarie Trevelyan) | Party: Conservative Party | Department: COP26 The UK recognises the serious and unequivocal threat that climate change poses to our planet, and that it can indeed undermine the enjoyment of human rights. The Paris agreement preamble states that respecting and promoting our human rights is fundamental to effective climate implementation. Therefore, human rights are a cross-cutting consideration in all climate action, so we will be working with all countries this year to achieve an ambitious, inclusive and shared outcome from COP26 to help safeguard human rights. 14 Jul 2021 | Oral questions - Lead | Answered | House of Commons | House of Commons chamber | 902689 | 699 cc354-5 Asked by: Steven Bonnar | Party: Scottish National Party I thank the Minister for that answer. Scotland was not only the first country in the world to declare a climate emergency, but the first in the world to establish a dedicated climate justice fund—a fund that was recently doubled by the SNP Scottish Government in Edinburgh. Will the UK Government, ahead of COP Glasgow, match Scotland’s ambitions? Will this Government create such a fund, and will the Minister and the COP26 President ensure that the focus of COP26 is placed squarely on the rights of those who will be affected first and foremost by the climate emergency?  10  Commons Library Debate Pack, 15 September 2021  General debate on the Role and the response of the devolved administrations to COP26  Answered by: Anne-Marie Trevelyan | Party: Conservative Party | Department: COP26 As my right hon. Friend the COP26 President set out, the UK remains one of the largest donors in supporting a number of areas, including, obviously, humanitarian assistance and humanitarian rights. I would be interested to hear more on the details of the climate justice fund to understand the premise of it, but the UK continues to have an absolutely clear commitment to that. 14 Jul 2021 | Oral questions - 1st Supplementary | Answered | House of Commons | House of Commons chamber | 699 c354 Environment Protection: Wales Asked by: Jones, Ruth | Party: Labour Party To ask the Secretary of State for Wales, what discussions he has had with the COP29 President on promoting a green recovery from the covid-19 outbreak in (a) Newport West constituency and (b) Wales. Answering member: Simon Hart | Party: Conservative Party | Department: Wales Office I have had a number of discussions with the COP26 President Designate about the opportunities that exist in Wales to support the drive to net zero, including as part of the COP26 Devolved Administrations Ministerial Group, which I last attended on 10 June. The UK Government is actively progressing plans to deliver a Green Industrial Revolution that drives the transition to net zero and levels up across the UK. The Prime Minister set out his ambitious 10 Point Plan back in November, which will mobilise £12 billion of UK Government investment to create and support up to 250,000 highly-skilled green jobs across the UK, and spur over three times as much private sector investment by 2030. As I set out in the UK Government’s Plan for Wales, Wales is at the heart of this agenda. We have backed the South Wales Industrial Cluster with £21.5 million to develop detailed plans to support the region’s net zero transition. We are supporting floating offshore wind, which has the potential to deliver significant supply chain benefits to South Wales and beyond, with a range of policy measures. In addition, we have committed £15.9 million to pioneer lowcarbon transport technologies in Cwmbran. We recognise there is more to do and will bring forward a Net Zero Strategy and plans to decarbonise buildings and transport later this year, which will present further opportunities to the people of Newport West, wider South East Wales and beyond. 28 Jun 2021 | Written questions | Answered | House of Commons | 20525  Air Pollution: Northern Ireland Executive  11  Commons Library Debate Pack, 15 September 2021  General debate on the Role and the response of the devolved administrations to COP26  Asked by: Jones, Ruth | Party: Labour Party To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, when he last had discussions with the Northern Ireland Executive on tackling toxic air. Answering member: Mr Robin Walker | Party: Conservative Party | Department: Northern Ireland Office Air quality in Northern Ireland is a matter for the Northern Ireland Executive. The UK Government is committed to delivering action on climate change at a global scale through its leadership at COP26. The UK Government has committed to reduce emissions by 78% by 2035 compared to 1990 levels, ahead of achieving Net Zero by 2050. This will deliver cleaner air, as well as jobs, prosperity, and a brighter future. We will deliver this action across the whole United Kingdom and Northern Ireland has an important role to play in that. Northern Ireland has great potential to become a leader in hydrogen technology, and the UK Government has supported this including providing £11.2m to Wrightbus to develop and manufacture low-cost hydrogen fuel cell technology for buses and create a hydrogen centre of excellence. In addition, through the New Decade, New Approach agreement the UK Government has provided £50m over two years to support the rollout of ultra-low emission public transport. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland regularly meets with stakeholders across Northern Ireland, including Executive Ministers, and discusses climate change in Northern Ireland. In addition, the COP26 President chairs the COP26 Devolved Administrations Ministerial Group, which meets quarterly. 24 Jun 2021 | Written questions | Answered | House of Commons | 16953 UN Climate Conference 2021 Asked by: Maskell, Rachael | Party: Labour Party · Cooperative Party To ask the President of COP26, what steps he will take to involve all the regions of the UK in the COP26 summit. Answering member: Alok Sharma | Party: Conservative Party | Department: COP26 We are committed to ensuring an inclusive, whole of society COP26, representative of all of the UK. This will be a key objective as we select organisations to be represented in the Green Zone and on the UK Pavilion. Through our domestic ‘Together for our Planet’ campaign we are building awareness and understanding of COP26 across the UK, giving people the chance to get involved in the run-up to the Summit. For example, we recently ran our Creative Earth art competition inviting young people from around the UK to design artwork setting out their vision for the planet, and the winners will be showcased at COP26 in November. We have also encouraged stakeholders who would like to be involved in events or showcasing in UKG managed spaces at COP26 to submit bids through an Expression of Interest  12  Commons Library Debate Pack, 15 September 2021  General debate on the Role and the response of the devolved administrations to COP26  process, and we have received proposals from stakeholders from across the UK. We are working with the Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland Executive to ensure an inclusive and ambitious summit for the whole of the UK. All parts of the UK will have important roles to play in ensuring the summit’s success. I have invited climate change Ministers from the Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland Executive to participate in a regular devolved administrations Group to ensure effective engagement and collaboration on COP26 in support of the delivery of an inclusive and welcoming COP26. The third meeting was held last week. I also chair the COP26 UK Mayors and Regions Advisory Council with mayors and local leaders from across the UK. The most recent meeting was on 15 March. Additionally, we work closely with several Non-State Actor organisations such as UK100 to further engage with local leaders. 21 Jun 2021 | Written questions | Answered | House of Commons | 13141 UN Climate Conference 2021: Third Sector Asked by: Crosbie, Virginia | Party: Conservative Party To ask the President of COP26, what steps he is taking to work with the Welsh Government to ensure there are opportunities for civil society to engage with COP26. Answering member: Alok Sharma | Party: Conservative Party | Department: COP26 Civil society, with their links to on-the-ground communities and practitioners, are key partners to achieve the goals we have set for COP26. This is why I have set up an International COP26 Civil Society and Youth Advisory Council so that we can hear and act on the knowledge of civil society groups. My officials run regular, open-invite calls with a large network of civil society organisations to share updates on our planning for COP26, which are regularly attended by Welsh groups. We are working with the Welsh Government, alongside the other devolved administrations, to ensure an inclusive and ambitious COP26 for the whole of the UK. As part of this, I chair the COP26 Devolved Administrations (DAs) Ministerial meeting with climate change ministers from the DAs. The COP26 Unit also worked with the Welsh Government and other DAs to encourage proposals from stakeholders across the UK via the Expression of Interest process for events or showcasing in UK Government managed spaces at COP26. 09 Jun 2021 | Written questions | Answered | House of Commons | 10714 COP26 Asked by: Angela Crawley (Lanark and Hamilton East) (SNP) [V] | Party: Scottish National Party  13  Commons Library Debate Pack, 15 September 2021  General debate on the Role and the response of the devolved administrations to COP26  The SNP Scottish Government have committed to doubling their climate change justice fund if re-elected next week. This £21 million fund is used to help combat the effects of climate change in the global south while we tackle carbon emissions at home. In the year of COP26, will the UK Government follow Scotland’s lead and commit to a comparable climate justice fund to help those affected by climate change? Answered by: David Duguid | Party: Conservative Party | Department: Scotland Not only will we commit to a comparable financial commitment, but the recent spending review committed to spending £12 billion on green measures to support the 10-point plan and boost the UK’s global leadership on green infrastructure and technologies, not just ahead of COP26 this year, but beyond as well. 28 Apr 2021 | Oral questions - Supplementary | Answered | House of Commons | House of Commons chamber | 693 c362 Climate Change Convention: Northern Ireland Asked by: Young, Jacob | Party: Conservative Party What discussions he has had with Cabinet colleagues on the opportunities for Northern Ireland in COP26. Answering member: Mr Robin Walker | Party: Conservative Party | Department: Northern Ireland Office The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and I have attended crossgovernment meetings with the COP President, most recently on 22 March. I also recently met with the Chair of the Expert Panel on the Future of Energy to discuss the NI Executive’s Energy Strategy and how the UK Government can help in developing this. We continue to press for engagement with the Executive and Northern Ireland businesses in order to promote Northern Ireland’s interests. Recent announcements of New Deal funding to support green technology in Northern Ireland and support for the production of hydrogen buses in Ballymena reflect the priority which this Government has given to decarbonisation. We all want to see Northern Ireland play a big role in the Green Industrial Revolution, and COP26 will provide us an opportunity to showcase Northern Ireland’s many advances in green technologies. 21 Apr 2021 | Written questions | Answered | House of Commons | 914373 UN Climate Conference 2021 Asked by: Jones, Ruth | Party: Labour Party To ask the Secretary of State for Wales, what discussions he has had with (a) Cabinet colleagues and (b) the Welsh Government on preparations for COP26.  14  Commons Library Debate Pack, 15 September 2021  General debate on the Role and the response of the devolved administrations to COP26  Answering member: Simon Hart | Party: Conservative Party | Department: Wales Office I have regular discussions with the Welsh Government and Cabinet colleagues on a wide range of climate change matters, including the preparations for COP26 to ensure an inclusive and ambitious COP26 for the whole of the UK. This includes when I recently met the Welsh Government Minister for Environment, Energy and Rural Affairs at the COP26 Devolved Administrations Ministerial Group on 22 March 2021. The COP26 Devolved Administrations Ministerial Group brings together the COP26 President Designate, Territorial Secretaries of State and climate change ministers from the devolved administrations to ensure effective engagement and collaboration on COP26 and will meet quarterly in the run up to the summit. There is also ongoing official-level engagement with the Welsh Government on COP26. 21 Apr 2021 | Written questions | Answered | House of Commons | 181435  Climate Change Convention: Northern Ireland Asked by: Jupp, Simon | Party: Conservative Party What discussions he has had with Cabinet colleagues on potential opportunities for Northern Ireland at COP26. Answering member: Mr Robin Walker | Party: Conservative Party | Department: Northern Ireland Office We are working closely with colleagues across Government and the NI Executive to support opportunities for Northern Ireland at this important event. This Government has announced a number of initiatives to promote Northern Ireland’s potential as a leader in innovative technology, especially in green and clean technologies. This includes the £400 million investment through the New Deal for Northern Ireland. I recently attended a meeting with the COP President and pressed for continued engagement with the Executive and NI businesses in order to promote Northern Ireland’s interests. I also met with Laura Sandys, our former Hon. Friend, to discuss her work as an adviser to NI’s energy strategy. 20 Jan 2021 | Written questions | Answered | House of Commons | 910937 Climate Change Convention Asked by: Griffith, Andrew | Party: Conservative Party To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland, what recent discussions he has had with Cabinet colleagues on the business opportunities for Scotland arising from COP26.  15  Commons Library Debate Pack, 15 September 2021  General debate on the Role and the response of the devolved administrations to COP26  Answering member: Mr Alister Jack | Party: Conservative Party | Department: Scotland Office I have frequent discussions with Cabinet colleagues on the opportunities which COP26 offers for businesses in Scotland and the whole of the UK. The Government is committed to delivering an ‘all of UK’ COP26 in Glasgow. All parts of the UK will have important roles to play in ensuring the summit’s success. We are working with the Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland Executive to ensure an inclusive and ambitious summit for the whole of the UK. The UK Government is committed to leading the way in tackling climate change working with all countries and with civil society, companies and people on the frontline of climate change, in the UK and globally, to inspire action ahead of COP26. The COP26 Business Leaders group brings together key internationally focused businesses across a broad range of sectors who are taking positive climate action. We are inviting businesses from every corner of the UK to join us in the Race to Zero. Race To Zero is a global initiative, backed by science-based targets, to commit businesses, cities, regions, investors and universities to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 at the very latest. I am encouraged by the engagement that we have seen so far and look forward to continuing to work with businesses to maximise the opportunities which the summit brings. 20 Jan 2021 | Written questions | Answered | House of Commons | 137358  4.2  Scottish Parliament Question ref. S6W-01317 Asked by: Lennon, Monica, Central Scotland To ask the Scottish Government for what matters it will have responsibility for at COP 26, and what areas of responsibility it will share with the UK Government. Answered by Michael Matheson on 9 August 2021 From the moment it was announced that COP26 would be coming to Glasgow, the Scottish Government have been fully committed to playing our role in ensuring a safe and secure event. The Government of the United Kingdom hold the presidency of COP26 and are therefore responsible for working alongside the United Nations to organise the main summit and its attached "Green Zone". A joint COP26 delivery framework has been agreed between the Government of the United Kingdom and the Scottish Government, which includes Glasgow City Council and Scottish Agencies. This outlines the plans,  16  Commons Library Debate Pack, 15 September 2021  General debate on the Role and the response of the devolved administrations to COP26  organisation, structure, systems and methodology that will be used to manage delivery of COP26 including appropriate mitigation of impact on business as usual. As the Scottish Government have devolved powers around Safety and Resilience, our colleagues and organisations such Police Scotland, and Transport Scotland, who are responsible for the COP26 transport plan, have been engaged through the COP26 planning process. With a separate Legal landscape in Scotland, we are responsible for ensuring the correct legislative mechanisms are put in place that will allow the event to happen. The Scottish Government is proactively leading a Scottish response to COP26, ensuring that our communities, businesses and organisations have the opportunities to engage and benefit from COP26 coming to Glasgow. Part of our offering will be to host a Scotland Zone, showcasing the talents, skills and innovative approach that Scotland is taking to addressing the climate emergency. Question ref. S6W-01623 Asked by: Liam Kerr, North East Scotland, Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party To ask the Scottish Government, as of 20 July 2021, how many meetings in relation to COP26 Scottish Ministers have (a) organised and (b) attended. Answered by Michael Matheson on 16 August 2021 The Scottish Government looks forward to a successful COP26 in November that delivers increased global ambition to net zero in a way that is fair and just. Scottish Ministers have engaged widely on COP26, and will continue to do so in the run up to, during and after the conference. Between 1 January 2020 and 20 July 2021, all Scottish Ministers (excluding the First Minister) attended a total of 36 meetings in relation to COP26. Between 1 January 2020 and 28 July 2021, the First Minister attended 4 meetings in relation to COP26. The majority of meetings included in these figures are external engagements, including meetings between the previous Cabinet Secretary for Environment, Climate Change And Land Reform Ms. Cunningham and the UK Government. Whilst meetings referenced here include those with COP26 as a specified focus of the engagement, a significant amount of climate- related Ministerial meetings since Glasgow was announced as the COP26 host city are likely to have included discussions of COP26 to some extent.  4.3  Welsh Parliament WQ83184 (e)Tabled on 11/08/2021 Janet Finch-Saunders MS  17  Commons Library Debate Pack, 15 September 2021  General debate on the Role and the response of the devolved administrations to COP26  Will the Minister confirm what plans, events and activities the Welsh Government has scheduled for COP26 later this year? Answered by Minister for Health and Social Services | Answered on 19/08/2021 We plan to attend COP26 as part of the UK Delegation, as well as joining events with key international networks such as the Under2Coalition and Regions4. In addition to participating in the events in Glasgow, the Welsh Government will organise a programme of ‘COP Cymru’ activity here in Wales in the lead up to, during and after the UN conference. These events will give opportunities for our stakeholders across Wales to get involved in delivery of our forthcoming Net Zero Plan.  4.4  Northern Ireland Assembly AQW 19542/17-22 Mr John Blair (APNI - South Antrim) To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs what action his Department is taking, ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in November, to accelerate Northern Ireland's contribution towards the goals of the Paris Agreement. Answered on 11/06/2021 Following the June 2019 amendment to the UK Climate Change Act 2008, which introduced a UK Net Zero by 2050 target in line with the Paris Agreement, I wrote to Lord Deben, the Chair of the UK Climate Change Committee (CCC), the Statutory Advisors to Government on climate change, to seek their expert advice on what would be Northern Ireland’s fair and equitable contribution to the UK Net Zero target. The CCC advised that Northern Ireland’s fair and equitable contribution to UK Net Zero by 2050 should be to achieve at least an 82% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the 1990 baseline year. The commitment in New Decade New Approach (NDNA) was for the Executive to tackle climate change head on with a strategy to address the immediate and longer term impacts of climate disruption and to introduce legislation and targets for reducing carbon emissions in line with the Paris Climate Change Accord. After consideration of the outcome of my consultation on the matter, and the expert advice and evidence I received from the independent UK Climate Change Committee in Dec 2020, I have brought before my Executive  18  Commons Library Debate Pack, 15 September 2021  General debate on the Role and the response of the devolved administrations to COP26  Colleagues for their agreement, my policy proposals for a Climate Change Bill for Northern Ireland. My Department along with the Office of Legislative Council are also well advanced in the drafting of a Climate Change Bill based on my proposals, a Bill which if enacted will set legally binding net greenhouse gas emissions reductions targets in Northern Ireland in line with the CCC’s advice. I intend to seek agreement on my draft Bill and accompanying Explanatory and Financial Memorandum from my Executive colleagues in the coming weeks. Once Executive agreement is secured to proceed, I intend to move quickly to introduce my Bill to the Assembly, as I want to see my Bill complete its legislative passage within the lifetime of the current Assembly mandate so as to deliver on NDNA. In June last year I announced ambitious plans for my Department to lead on the development of a Green Growth Strategy for Northern Ireland. The Strategy operates under the oversight of the Executive through an InterMinisterial Group (IMG), which I chair, and will require all Departments to work together collaboratively to deliver our objectives. The Strategy and associated Climate Action Plan will be our route map to accelerate delivery on climate action, green jobs and a clean environment. The Strategy will look out to 2050, in line with the Paris Agreement, and provide a pathway for delivery of sector-specific greenhouse gas emission targets. The Climate Action Plan will focus on the shorter term actions we must take across all sectors to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Northern Ireland. A Green Growth Strategy Framework has been drafted by my Department, with input other Departments. You will have had sight of the draft Green Growth Strategy Framework, as it was shared with the AERA Committee members for their consideration. Once all feedback is received and taken into account I will seek the Executive’s endorsement prior to publication. My intention is that the draft strategy will be published for consultation in advance of COP26 in November 2021 with delivery of a final strategy by the end of March 2022. The Green Growth Strategy and Climate Action Plan will provide a strong foundation to drive forward action. Ahead of COP26 my Department is also leading on the development of a number of important areas of policy including an NI Peatlands Strategy, an NI Environment Strategy and ongoing programmes such as ‘Forests for Our Future’ which I launched in March 2020. AQW 19541/17-22 Mr John Blair (APNI - South Antrim) To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs when he last discussed the climate emergency with his counterparts in the UK government. Answered on 16/06/2021 I have regular discussions with my counterparts in the UK Government and  19  Commons Library Debate Pack, 15 September 2021  General debate on the Role and the response of the devolved administrations to COP26  the other Devolved Administrations, on a range of matters relating to climate change, through a number of working groups.

Linking to the EU ETS  9  The Four administrations announced in June 2020 that they would be introducing a UK Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS) to replace the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) after the UK left the EU. This was following a consultation and recommendations from the Climate Change Committee. The UK government and the devolved administrations collectively constitute the UK ETS Authority to oversee the UK ETS. 1 The UK ETS, a cap and trade emissions scheme, is of similar design and has similar aims to the EU ETS. However, it will have a 5% reduction in the emissions cap that would have been set under that scheme. In addition, the aim is to align it with the UK 2050 net zero target by 2024 at the latest. Further details of the UK ETS were provided in the Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy published in March 2021. The Government also announced the first auction of allowances would take place in May 2021. The UK and EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement committed both parties to explore options for linking their schemes but does not go further.  1  Gov.uk, Participating in the UK ETS [website visited 4 May 2021]  www.parliament.uk/commons-library | intranet.parliament.uk/commons-library | papers@parliament.uk | @commonslibrary  2  The UK Emissions Trading Scheme  1. The UK in the EU ETS The EU ETS is the largest multi-country, multi-sector greenhouse gas emissions trading system in the world covering more than 11,000 power stations and industrial plants across EU Member states. Around 1,000 of those were in the UK until it left the EU and the EU ETS on 31 December 2020, after the end of the Brexit transition period. 2 The EU ETS is a mandatory emissions cap-and-trade scheme. It sets an EU-wide cap on the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions from energy intensive sectors including power stations and industrial plants. The cap decreases over time to reduce overall emissions. 3 The EU ETS now also includes airlines operating between countries covered byt the EU ETS, via a separate cap. Approximately 140 UK-administered aircraft operators take part in the EU ETS. 4 The EU ETS was launched in 2005 and has since undergone a number of reforms. Under the scheme, companies either receive EU allowances (EUAs) free or purchase them during auctions of allowances issued by Governments. 5 Surplus allowances can also be traded on the open carbon market. The number of allowances held by any company that falls under the scheme at the end of an EU ETS year must be equal to, or more than, the total volume of its emissions, or they are fined. 6 As a result of the low allowance prices the EU introduced several measures over time to reduce allowances, including removing surplus allowances from the market. The UK also responded to the issue of the low cost of EUAs by introducing the Carbon Price Floor (or CPF) in 2013. This was a UK-only carbon tax which supplemented the price of EUAs. The CPF increased the price of carbon for UK participants, by setting a minimum price, and helped to drive coal almost completely out of the UK energy mix. 7 Revenue from both the EU ETS auctions and the CPF were retained by HM Treasury. There is no equivalent EUwide floor price for EUA auctions. In Phase III (2013-2020), power stations purchased all their allowances whereas other industries still received some of their EUAs via free allocation. Both sectors were also able to buy international credits from emission-saving projects around the world. 8 The UK participated until the end of Phase III, which aimed for an overall emissions reduction of 21% compared to 2005 emissions for power stations and industrial plants. Phase IV of the EU ETS runs from 2021-2030, without UK participation. Under this, sectors covered by the EU ETS are required to reduce their emissions by 43% compared to 2005 levels. To increase emissions cuts, the overall number of emission allowances will be reduced by 2.2% a year from 2021 onwards, compared to the previous 1.74% annual reduction. The amount of surplus allowances that will be held in reserve will also be significantly reduced after 2023.  2  3 4 5  6 7  8  The greenhouse gases covered by EU ETS are carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs). European Commission, Climate Action, ‘Emissions cap and allowances’, [accessed: 4 May 2021] Gov.uk, Meeting climate change requirements if there’s no Brexit deal, 12 October 2018 Each allowance gives the holder the right to emit one tonne of carbon dioxide or the equivalent of nitrous oxide and perfluorocarbons.

Carbon Brief has also published a detailed Q&A on the EU ETS.  2. Options for carbon pricing after Brexit The Climate Change Committee (CCC) published a letter to Government in August 2019 following a request from the Government on its recommendations for the approach to carbon pricing after Brexit. It made three key recommendations: 1.  The Government should not rely on carbon pricing alone. Whilst carbon pricing is essential it needs to be used as part of a suite of policy instruments, as confirmed by real-world experience internationally.  2.  We agree with the Government’s preference for a linked UK-EU ETS in the case of EU exit. Should a linked scheme prove not to be possible, we will offer further recommendations.  3.  We recommend that the cap of the linked UK ETS be set based on the costeffective path to the UK’s new net-zero target. We will provide that trajectory in our advice on the sixth carbon budget (covering 2033-2037), which is due in 2020. 9  The CCC examined three options: a linked scheme, a standalone scheme and a carbon tax. The Annex to the letter set out its views on all of these and of continuing in the EU ETS: •  Linking a UK ETS to the EU ETS is the Government’s current preference for a scheme:  This would offer access to a liquid market in emissions allowances, incentivising decarbonisation at lowest cost across Europe. The EU’s Market Stability Reserve is likely to enable price visibility. Additionally, if there were common emissions trading arrangements with a large (and geographically close) trading partner this would reduce the risk of carbon leakage. However, unless and until the EU adopts a net-zero target and amends the EU ETS, the scheme is less aligned to the UK’s net-zero target, implying a greater role for supplementary policies in the UK. Additionally, under this scheme it is likely that the UK will need to mirror the EU ETS scheme as closely as possible. Therefore there may be limited room for expanding the sectoral coverage of any scheme in the near term, and the UK may have limited input on governance arrangements. •  In case a linking agreement with the EU cannot be reached, a standalone UK ETS could be an option:  A standalone UK ETS may offer more policy autonomy than a linked ETS, and the opportunity to align the scheme more directly to the UK’s current emissions, net-zero ambition and directly to carbon budgets. However, the scheme risks low liquidity in the long-term unless sectoral coverage is expanded. The system would require robust rules and governance around price or quantity of permits to ensure that a sensible price prevails, particularly given likely volatility in the early years of a new scheme. Furthermore, expansion of a UK scheme could impact the possibility of securing linking agreements to other schemes, as experience suggests linking of differentiated schemes can be a complex and lengthy process. •Implementation of a UK carbon tax is the Government’s fall back position in the case of leaving the EU without a deal: ‒ A carbon tax offers less complexity than trading schemes, and lower administrative costs potentially expanding the range of actors and sectors to which it can be applied 9  CCC, Annex to the Letter to the Government on the Future of Carbon Pricing, 7 August 2019  4  The UK Emissions Trading Scheme  in the near-term. A strong and rising tax that offers stability and visibility will give greater price certainty than an emissions trading scheme, though less certainty over the quantity of emissions. ‒ However, experience with the Carbon Price Support and Fuel Duty Escalator suggests that effective governance arrangements around a carbon tax would be required in order to ensure price visibility. Additionally, as taxes do not set a limit on quantity, a greater role may be required of other policy instruments if a tax under delivers. •Remaining a member of the EU ETS would maintain current arrangements. We agree with the Government’s preference for a linked UK-EU ETS in the case of UK exit. This maintains key benefits of membership of the EU scheme, most notably access to a wider market and addressing competitiveness issues by maintaining a level playing field across the EU. 10  In addition to its recommendation to Government, the CCC also published a report by VIVID economics on the Future of Carbon Pricing in the UK which provides more detailed analysis of each option.  3. The UK ETS Throughout the Brexit negotiations both the UK and EU had expressed a preference for a linked ETS (for further details of the negotiations and how they addressed climate change more broadly see the Commons Briefing Paper Brexit: Energy and Climate Change) . The Government considered the options of a carbon tax or a UK ETS scheme after the transition ends. As part of this, in May 2019, the UK Government and the devolved Administrations launched a consultation on The future of UK carbon pricing. 11 The consultation set out a number of options. It also identified the establishment of a UK national emissions trading system (UK ETS) linked to the EU ETS following the end of Phase III as the preferred option of the UK Government and the devolved Administrations. This was also the CCC’s preferred option, as set out above.  3.1 Decision to implement a UK ETS The consultation was followed by an announcement by the four Administrations on 1 June 2020, in the consultation response, that Administrations would establish a UK ETS and be open to a link with the EU ETS: We intend to establish a UK Emissions Trading System with Phase I running from 2021- 2030, which could operate as either a linked or standalone system. As stated in ‘The UK’s Approach to Negotiations’ the UK would be open to considering a link between any future UK Emissions Trading System (ETS) and the EU ETS (as Switzerland has done with its ETS), if it suited both sides’ interests. As announced at Budget 2020, the UK Government will publish a consultation later this year on the design of a Carbon Emission Tax as an alternative to a UK ETS, to ensure a carbon price remains in place in all scenarios. 12  The consultation response also set out the Government’s intention to set a 5% tighter cap for UK emissions than was set out in Phase IV of the EU ETS:  10 11 12  CCC, Annex to the Letter to the Government on the Future of Carbon Pricing, 7 August 2019, Gov.uk consultation, The future of UK carbon pricing, 21 May 2019 The future of UK carbon pricing UK: Government and Devolved Administrations’ response, June 2020  5  Commons Library Briefing, 4 May 2021  In light of the UK’s commitment to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, the UK ETS will show greater climate ambition from the start. As such, the cap will initially be set 5% below the UK’s notional share of the EU ETS cap for Phase IV of the EU ETS. 13  Unlike the EU ETS, the Government proposed setting an auction reserve price for the UK ETS. This would be £15 “to ensure a minimum level of ambition and price continuity”. This was increased to £22 when the scheme was launched (see section 4 below). 14 In addition, international credits would “not be permitted at this time”. 15 An Impact Assessment covering the UK ETS operation from 2021-2024 was published by BEIS, alongside the consultation response in June 2020. 16 The main conclusions of the assessment for introducing a UK ETS, as opposed to remaining in the EU ETS, were of an overall benefit to society, higher revenue to Government, and potentially higher costs to business (although with a wide range of variables that could affect this): 122. Overall, the analysis in this IA suggests that a standalone UK ETS design, as set out in the government response, could deliver a net benefit to society in its initial years, compared with the counterfactual of staying in the EU ETS. The analysis suggests a positive net present value (NPV) to society. 123. The main benefits of the UK ETS scenario, compared with the counterfactual, are the higher carbon benefit of additional abatement and the higher revenue that the government will receive due to higher expected carbon values (partly offset by lower estimated number of allowances purchased). There are also non-monetised benefits, such as an improvement in air quality and switching to a less carbon-intensive energy supply. 124. The main costs of the UK ETS scenario, compared with the counterfactual, are the additional admin costs for the government in setting up the UK ETS and one-off cost to businesses of complying with the new scheme, and additional costs to system participants due to them facing higher expected carbon values under the UK ETS scenario. 125. Our analysis shows that, despite an overall benefit to society of reduced emissions, the costs to businesses of delivering these emissions reductions are higher in the UK ETS scenario than the counterfactual. 17  However, these conclusions were caveated with the warning that “the analysis are largely driven by our assumptions for how UK participants will behave in the early years, over which there is significant uncertainty”. 18 The net cost to business was estimated to be between £5m to £11m a year, in 2019 prices. The Government implemented the necessary legislation for the creation of a UK ETS through regulation in the Finance Act 2020 . The Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme Order 2020 was made on 11 November 2020.  Energy White Paper The Government published the Energy White Paper: Powering our Net Zero future on 14 December 2020, confirming the decision to go forward with a UK ETS scheme. The paper set out proposals that go further than EU ETS scheme, with the UK ETS scheme expanding 13 14 15 16  17 18  The future of UK carbon pricing UK: Government and Devolved Administrations’ response, June 2020 The existing carbon floor price within the EU ETS was set as £18.08 until 2021 The future of UK carbon pricing UK: Government and Devolved Administrations’ response, June 2020 The assessment considers the initial years of the UK ETS, based on the design set out in the government response: a cap on emissions set based on a 5% reduction on our notional share of the EU ETS, free allocation based on our notional share of the EU ETS, and a transitional auction reserve price starting at £15 per allowance.

The accompanying Written Statement summarised the Government’s approach as follows: To support businesses to decarbonise the Government is today confirming a new and ambitious UK Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS), will be in place from 1 January 2021. This new UK carbon market will be the foundation on which the UK achieves net zero emissions cost effectively. The scheme has been designed by the UK Government jointly with the Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland Executive and is a crucial step towards net zero, and will bring benefits for business, trade, and innovation. The UK ETS will replace the UK’s participation in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and will be a market-based measure which will provide continuity for participants. The UK ETS will initially apply to power stations, energy-intensive industries, and aviation. Our UK ETS is more ambitious than the EU system it replaces - from day one the cap on emissions allowed within the scheme will be reduced by 5 per cent, and we will consult in due course on aligning it with net zero. The UK ETS will also allow us to expand carbon pricing across the economy and encourage innovation in emerging decarbonisation technologies. We have committed to exploring expanding the UK ETS to the two thirds of uncovered emissions, and will set out our aspirations to continue to lead the world on carbon pricing in the run up to COP26. This will also include how the UK ETS could incentivise the deployment of greenhouse gas removal technologies. In addition to this, the UK is open to linking the UK ETS internationally in principle and we are considering a range of options, but no decision on our preferred linking partners has yet been made. 19  Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy The Government published its Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy on 17 March 2021. The summary set out the role the UK ETS would play in the UK achieving its 2050 Net Zero target: An ambitious UK Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS) cap will send a clear signal to the market that this government is committed to reaching net zero. While risks associated with low carbon investments remain high, or if the carbon price is low, targeted government funding mechanisms will pull through investment from the private sector for the deployment of technologies. A reformed approach to mitigating carbon leakage, adapting over time to reflect a tighter ETS cap alongside increased deployment of low carbon technologies, will ensure our global and domestic climate goals are met, while supporting the growth of low carbon manufacturing in the UK 20  The Strategy also set out further details on the intention to align the EU ETS with the Net Zero target by 2024, and how the scheme will fit in with other UK carbon pricing mechanisms; together with plans to examine options on expanding it to cover further sectors: Action 2.1: Use carbon pricing as a tool to send a clear market signal, providing certainty over our net zero ambition for industrial sectors Carbon pricing is a cost-effective and technology-neutral tool for getting industry to take account of its emissions in business decisions. Pricing policies like the Carbon Price Support and EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) have helped drive a switch from coal to gas generation in the power sector, and the UK ETS will be a key part of the framework to reduce emissions from industry. In January 2021, we established a UK ETS to replace the UK’s participation in the EU ETS. To reflect our ambition on carbon pricing, the cap on allowances – which 19 20  BEIS, Energy white paper: Powering our net zero future, 14 December 2020 BEIS, Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy, 17 March 2021 p28  7  Commons Library Briefing, 4 May 2021  represents the overall limit of emissions allowed in the system – will be aligned with the UK’s net zero ambition by January 2024. In 2021, we will carry out a review of the UK ETS. This will include consulting on a net zero consistent emissions cap; reviewing the long-term role of free allowances; exploring expanding the scope of the scheme to cover more sectors of the economy and linking with other schemes internationally; and considering the case for a supply adjustment mechanism. Some industrial businesses, or facilities within an installation, will remain out of scope of the UK ETS at this time. For those businesses, we expect the Climate Change Levy (CCL) and action agreed through the Climate Change Agreements (CCA) scheme to act as a driver for energy efficiency improvements and decarbonisation. The CCA scheme has recently been extended by two years, providing significantly reduced CCL rates until March 2025 for participants who meet their targets. We intend to undertake further assessment of the purpose and targeting of a long-term scheme following the extension, informed by the responses to last year’s consultation. 21  In addition, the Government set out its intention to examine options on how the UK ETS could “be developed to incentivise deployment of negative emissions through greenhouse gas removal (GGR). 22 The Strategy also provided estimates of industry spending on the UK ETS of £390m per year (based on previous EU ETS costs for 2019) and a cost to Government of £1.05 billion per year (based on 2019) of free allowances for energy-intensive industries. Free allowances are the “main policy instrument through which carbon leakage risk and competitiveness impacts are addressed under the UK ETS”. 23  Commentary The BEIS Select Committee held two evidence sessions on the UK ETS framework in October and November 2020, before the final announcement to go ahead with the scheme. Ember, a climate change and energy think tank, published an article in December 2020 calling for the minimum allowance price to be set at £22 at least, as this was the average EU ETS allowance price in the last two years. The Energy and Climate Information Unit, a climate think tank, published detailed analysis Brexit: moving from the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to the UK-only ETS, following the announcement of a UK ETS being introduced.  Judicial review of UK ETS cap Judicial review proceedings where initiated in 2020 following the publication of the consultation response and impact assessment, with the case to be heard on 14 April 2021. The argument, as set out by Leigh Day solicitors, is that the emissions cap for 2021 does not comply with existing legislation or targets: Represented by Leigh Day solicitors, as well as David Wolfe QC at Matrix chambers and Ben Mitchell at 11KBW chambers, Georgia argues that in setting up the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS), the governments did not consider the short and medium-term aspects of the UK’s obligations under the Paris Agreement which requires substantial and immediate emission reductions, not just net zero by 2050. Georgia’s case is that the Climate Change Act 2008 grants the power to set up the UK ETS to limit greenhouse gas emissions, not to set an emissions cap to facilitate a smoother withdrawal from the EU.  21 22 23  BEIS, Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy, 17 March 2021 p29 BEIS, Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy, 17 March 2021 p33 BEIS, Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy, 17 March 2021 p108  8  The UK Emissions Trading Scheme  The cap on the UK ETS in its first year will be 156 mtCO2e, substantially higher than the projected ‘business-as-usual’ emissions of 126-131 mtCO2e for 2021. 24  The BEIS Impact Assessment states the following on the cap: In 2021 this notional minus 5% cap level equates to around 156 MtCO2e (based on the assumed scope of the policy set out earlier). This is higher than our BAU emissions projections in that year (ranging from around 126 to 131 MtCO2e). However, there is significant uncertainty over these projections and market participant behaviour in this initial period could lead to significant demand for allowances above BAU emissions. This in turn means there is uncertainty over the level of demand for allowances in these years relative to supply, and therefore risk of extreme high or low prices. Given these uncertainties we therefore believe it is appropriate to maintain sufficient headroom of allowances for a time-limited period at the start of the new system. However we believe that initially tightening the cap by 5% provides an appropriate balance between climate ambition in the context of the UK’s net zero commitment and businesses competitiveness, which may be at risk due to early years’ market behaviour.  It Impact Assessment also refers to the policy objective of establishing links with the EU ETS scheme: We assess the design of the UK ETS set out in the accompanying government response document, in its initial years of operation (from 2021 to 2024). This system is intended to fulfil the policy objectives outlined above as a standalone system, while also providing a platform to negotiate a linked system with the EU ETS, if it is in the best interests of both parties.  The case also challenges the decision to exclude energy from waste from the UK ETS, arguing that their emissions are “equivalent to approximately 5.4 per cent of the entire volume of greenhouse gas emissions covered by the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS).”  4. UK ETS implementation The Government published detailed guidance on participation in the UK ETS on 10 March 2021. This includes an implementation timetable, details of free allocations and, as for the EU ETS, exemptions for hospitals and small emitters. It also sets out that participants in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) must still comply with their obligations under that system for the 2020 compliance year which ended April 2021, provides further specific guidance on this. The guidance sets the UK ETS Auction Reserve Price (ARP) at £22, which is the minimum to be paid at auction, rather than the £15 announced in the consultation response. As a comparison, EUA prices have risen sharply since the end of 2020 and were over €40 in April 2010 (around £35). 25 This is a historic high; EUAs cost less than €10 per tonne in 2011 although by 2018 the price started to rise and reached €28 in 2019. 26 The Government announced on 17 December 2020 that it had appointed International Exchange Inc (ICE) to host UK emissions auctions for the UK Emissions Trading Scheme. It is also the host for the EU ETS. This was followed on 26 February 2021 by an announcement that the first auction for UK ETS allowances would be on 19 May 2021:  24  25 26  Leigh Day, Judicial review hearing over carbon emissions levels permitted under UK’s new emissions trading scheme, 12 April 2021 ICE, ICE EUA futures [website visited 13 April 2021] CarbonBrief, Q&A will the reformed EU ETS raise carbon prices? 6 December 2017 [accessed 3 September 2018]  9  Commons Library Briefing, 4 May 2021  “The publication of our ambitious UK Emissions Trading Scheme’s auction calendar is another crucial step towards our target of eliminating our contribution to climate change by 2050,” said UK Energy Minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan. “Our scheme is even more ambitious than the EU system it replaces and today’s publication will give businesses and operators clarity over this year’s supply of emissions allowances, enabling them to plan ahead, build back greener and better prepare for the transition to a low-carbon economy”. “We are excited about the addition of a new carbon market and believe the UK ETS will be pivotal in supporting the climate ambitions of the four governments of the UK”, said Gordon Bennett, Managing Director of Utility Markets at ICE. “UK emissions have fallen 41% since 1990, more than any other major developed country and this has been driven by the UK’s leadership in promoting market-based mechanisms to support climate goals. There is an enormous opportunity for cap and trade programs to take an even greater role in supporting the goals of the Paris Agreement, whether it is increasing their sector coverage or encouraging international linking. 27  Free allocation review On 17 March 2021, BEIS launched a call for evidence as part of its UK ETS free allocation review, including input on: •  key questions the review should consider, and the problems we should be looking at  •  how we can make free allocations fairer and more targeted when reducing in line with the reduction in the overall cap  •  examples and evidence of carbon leakage to help inform future free allocation policy. 28  5. Linking to the EU ETS The UK -EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) refers to carbon pricing in the section dealing with the level playing field, under Part 7.3: Carbon pricing. This requires both the UK and EU to have an effective system of carbon pricing in place as of 1 January 2021 covering emissions from electricity generation, heat generation, industry and aviation. The TCA also commits to exploring options to link both schemes: The Parties shall cooperate on carbon pricing. They shall give serious consideration to linking their respective carbon pricing systems in a way that preserves the integrity of these systems and provides for the possibility to increase their effectiveness. 29  The Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy does mention linking emissions trading systems under a heading on supporting industrial decarbonisation through trade policy, but does not mention the EU ETS specifically: Supporting greater collaboration on decarbonisation, such as exploring opportunities for practical cooperation on carbon pricing, including through possible linking of emissions trading systems, and committing to increased joint information exchanges and cooperative working in international forums. 30  In June 2020 the industry trade body, Energy UK, welcomed the Government’s aim of a linked UK ETS and the introduction of an auction reserve price:  27 28  29 30  ICE, ICE publishes auction calendar for UK’s new Emissions Trading Scheme, 26 February 2021 EUAs were at EUR 21.06 on 31 August 2018 and EUR 28.99 on 26 July 2019 according to ICE EUA futures via Sandbag and Quandl. UK/EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement, 24 December 2020 BEIS, Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy, 17 March 2021  10 The UK Emissions Trading Scheme  We strongly support Government establishing a UK ETS linked to the EU ETS and back its efforts to agree this approach with the EU. This is the best long-term carbon pricing mechanism to continue driving decarbonisation at the lowest cost to consumers, which will allow us to benefit from the liquidity of the world’s largest carbon market and help us meet our net zero target by 2050. In the event that a linking agreement cannot be secured in time for 1 January 2021, we welcome Government’s decision to introduce stability measures such as an Auction Reserve Price (ARP) to protect a newly-established stand-alone UK ETS from market shocks and volatility due to its smaller size 31  There is a precedent for a linked ETSs. Switzerland is not a participant in the EU ETS but in November 2017 it signed an agreement to link its emissions trading system with the EU ETS. 32 The agreement entered into force on 1 January 2020. Linking a UK ETS with the EU ETS would require agreement between both parties and be subject to negotiation. The E3G report on Climate change in the Brexit negotiations , published May 2020, noted that although both the UK and EU seem to have significant alignment in their approach, linking trading systems can take years of negotiation: However, although many of the high-level objectives have significant alignment the pathway to achieving this is far from automatic. The experience of linking the Swiss emissions trading system to the EU-ETS required years of negotiation to work through all the detail. It is therefore vital that substantive negotiations on these issues begin as soon as possible. 33  Overall, the process to link the Swiss ETS to the EU ETS took 10 years, partly because it was part of wider negotiations on trade. 34  31 32 33  34  Energy UK, Energy UK responds to UK Government's ETS proposal, 2 June 2020 EU, EU and Switzerland sign agreement to link emissions trading systems, 23 November 2017 E3G Briefing Paper, Climate change in the Brexit negotiations, Shane Tomlinson, May 2020 [accessed 16 June 2020] Council of the EU press release, Linking of Switzerland to the EU emissions trading system - entry into force on 1 January 2020, 9 December 2019  About the Library The House of Commons Library research service provides MPs and their staff with the impartial briefing and evidence base they need to do their work in scrutinising Government, proposing legislation, and supporting constituents.

In order to achieve that, the Government needs to set out in its Net Zero Strategy who, at ministerial level, will be responsible for delivering net zero, coordinating the roles of different departments, and ensuring that the UK remains on track to meet its net zero target in a cost-effective way. In the Net Zero Review final report, the Government should set out what mechanisms it will put in place to integrate the net zero target within departments’ spending review commitments, and how departments will be held to account should they fail to meet their targets. The Chancellor should publish the Net Zero Strategy as soon as possible and should set out, in conjunction with the Net Zero Review final report, the principles upon which the UK will fund its transition to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. There are a number of different estimates of the cost of achieving net zero by 2050. However, the Government has not yet committed to its own cost estimates and should set these out as soon as possible. The Government should include in the Net Zero Review final report its own methodology on costs; and it should set out clearly where the uncertainties lie. The Treasury should also include a range of scenarios on how net zero might be achieved, and the associated cost for each scenario. The Treasury’s Net Zero Review final report should include clear sectoral pathways towards decarbonisation and should address the key policy decisions as to the future of high carbon industries. Particular attention should be given to the potential regional impact of those decisions and the Government should set out a framework and strategy for supporting those communities which will be most impacted by these changes. This is especially important given the Government’s commitment to a Just Transition as part of the Paris Agreement. Private finance The Government has recognised that private finance will need to play a key part in funding the transition to net zero. If it is to do so, the Government will need to provide long-term certainty in climate-related policy and must ensure that consistent policy signals are sent to investors. We are encouraged that the Government acknowledged these needs in the 2021 Budget. We welcome the announcement in the 2021 Budget of a timetable for the issuance of the UK’s first green sovereign bond or ‘green gilt’. However, the UK is lagging behind other countries in the issuance of these green bonds. This runs the risk of holding back the development of a private sterling green bond market. Although concerns about the potential for green bonds to be a more expensive form of debt for the Government seem to have dissipated to a degree, the Government should none the less set out its tolerance, when issuing such bonds, for them to be more expensive than other forms of Government debt.  3  4  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  The Treasury should, as part of its review of Solvency II, consider reforms that could improve the funding of sustainable green infrastructure while maintaining the financial stability of insurers. In the proposed framework for the new UK Infrastructure Bank, the Chancellor should clarify its governance arrangements, how investment decisions will be made, and how it will ensure that it attracts sufficient private capital. In particular, it should clearly set out how the Bank will meet the Government’s commitment to Net Zero. The Government should also set out how it will incorporate lessons learned from the former Green Investment Bank, and whether it intends that the UK Infrastructure Bank should be funded to offer a lending facility at a level similar to that offered by the European Investment Bank before the UK referendum on membership of the EU. Consumer choice There is a high level of inertia amongst consumers around defined contribution pension fund choice, with most remaining in the ‘default’ fund. The Treasury has been robust in its view that default funds should not be required to move to more green alternatives, but at the same time maintains that consumers should not have to switch out of the default to invest sustainably. The Government should resolve this apparent contradiction. The Treasury should report regularly on the proportion of pension holders in defined contribution pension schemes who remain in the default fund, and the extent to which those default funds are aligned with a path to Net Zero. Financial products should be clearly labelled to allow consumers to assess the relative climate impacts of products and to make choices accordingly. However, allowing every firm to create its own consumer sustainability labels may lead to inconsistencies and consumer confusion. The Treasury and the Financial Conduct Authority should consult on the merits of making climate or carbon labels for consumer financial products mandatory, as a means to encourage innovation. The FCA should consult on how best to make such labels readily and widely understood. We note the concerns expressed about indices, in that the most popular may be carbonintensive, and those that purport to be green may have carbon-intensive constituents. The risk remains that many consumers are unaware of the carbon-intensity of the indices that their passive investments are tracking. The Treasury and regulators should therefore ensure that all indices (whether conventional or climate-friendly) clearly set out the overall carbon footprint of the assets included within indices. On the concerns around the constituents of indices described as ‘green’, we note the requirements under the Benchmarks Regulation, which should be used to help consumers make better choices. However, it is clear that in some cases the labels or descriptions of ‘green’ or ‘climate-related’ indices do not necessarily match legitimate consumer expectations of what they would commonly be understood to mean. The Treasury and FCA should review the provisions in the legislative and regulatory framework and ensure that the labels and descriptions of indices accurately reflect their content, in line with consumer expectations. The Government’s Green Finance Strategy noted the need for innovation in green finance products and services, yet the evidence we have received suggests that the pace  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  of innovation could be accelerated and that more could be done to encourage takeup. The Financial Conduct Authority should seriously consider undertaking further “green fintech challenges” to encourage innovation. The regulator should also set out how it will tackle remaining regulatory barriers which discourage innovative ‘green’ financial products from coming to market. The Government and the regulators should work more closely with the Green Finance Institute to bring innovative ideas which will benefit consumers to the market. Mainstreaming Green Finance The Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority should move quickly to incorporate their revised remits to include climate change. We will continue to monitor their progress and ongoing approach to the risks arising from climate change. We have heard differing evidence on whether there should be amendments to the capital regimes to promote net zero. In light of its new remit letter, the Bank of England must now explain its thinking, as to what measures it might consider appropriate for the capital regime to better accommodate the climate risk associated with different investments. It should set out its views on the options for amending the capital regimes to reflect its new remit, taking into account the potential interaction with the other aims of prudential policy. The Government has moved from a voluntary to a mandatory approach for ensuring that firms make climate-related financial disclosures. But the process will be run to different timetables for different firms, across different regulators according to the Roadmap published by the Joint Government Regulator TCFD Taskforce. The Treasury, via the Taskforce, will need to play a key role in ensuring that pressure is maintained for a consistent and rapid implementation of these disclosures. We also draw the Treasury’s attention to evidence suggesting that the disclosure regime could be widened in scope, and that firms might usefully offer fuller disclosures. A taxonomy is an important part of identifying what can be considered green investment, so the announcement of a UK taxonomy is welcome. The Treasury and regulators should work at speed to ensure that there is a clear timetable and legislative pathway to deliver a UK taxonomy ahead of COP26 in November 2021. The UK can utilise the EU’s taxonomy but can exceed it when it will assist the UK’s goals. The UK should seize the opportunity presented by COP26 to use its own work on a taxonomy to push for greater international convergence.  5  6  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  Introduction The Government’s decision to legislate for net zero 1. On 12 June 2019, the Rt Hon. Theresa May MP (then Prime Minister) announced that the UK would eradicate its net contribution to greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.1 A statutory instrument2 was laid before Parliament on the same day, seeking to amend the Climate Change Act 2008 to enshrine this target in legislation. The Government said that the UK was therefore the first G7 country to legislate for net zero emissions.3 2. On 2 July 2019, the Government published its Green Finance Strategy, which had two objectives: •  To align private sector financial flows with clean, environmentally sustainable and resilient growth, supported by Government action.  •  To strengthen the competitiveness of the UK financial sector.4  3. This Report, which is concerned mainly with the development of Green Finance in the face of the Government’s legislative Net Zero target, is published with two particular catalysts for action in mind. Firstly, in November 2021, the UK will host the 26th UN Climate Change Conference (COP 26), which will bring parties together to accelerate action towards the goals of the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.5 Secondly, the Treasury has indicated that in 2022 there will be a “refresh” of the Green Finance Strategy.6  Our inquiry 4. The previous Treasury Committee launched an inquiry into the Decarbonisation of the UK economy and green finance in June 2019,7 and it published terms of reference8 seeking evidence on: •  the potential economic opportunity offered by decarbonisation,  •  the Treasury’s strategy in facilitating clean growth and its response to the Climate Change Committee’s net-zero recommendation, and  •  green finance.  The previous Committee received written evidence from interested parties for this first phase of the inquiry and held three oral evidence sessions. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  UK Parliament, ‘Government gives details on setting a UK net zero emissions target’, accessed 11 February 2021 The Climate Change Act 2008 (2050 Target Amendment) Order 2019 UK Parliament, ‘Government gives details on setting a UK net zero emissions target’, accessed 11 February 2021 HM Treasury and Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, Green finance strategy; Transforming Finance for a Greener Future, July 2019, p 7 UK COP 26, ‘UN Climate Change Conference UK 2021’, accessed 19 February 2021 HM Treasury, A Roadmap towards mandatory climate-related disclosures, November 2020, Para 1.21 Treasury Select Committee, ‘Committee launch inquiry into decarbonisation of the UK economy’, accessed 11 February 2021 Treasury Select Committee, ‘Decarbonisation of the UK economy and Green Finance terms of reference’, accessed 11 February 2021  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  7  5. After the 2019 General Election and the establishment of the present Committee, we re-launched the inquiry9 in July 2020 with revised terms of reference, in the light of the coronavirus pandemic and our work on the economic impact of coronavirus. We received further written evidence from a variety of interested parties, including members of the general public, trade associations, the finance industry and businesses. The further four oral evidence sessions of the second phase of this inquiry focused on a post-coronavirus green recovery, green infrastructure and the way in which private finance could help the Government meet its net zero emissions target. 6. We are grateful to all those who submitted written evidence and those who gave oral evidence, including business and financial services experts, economists, representatives from the Bank of England, Financial Conduct Authority, the Pensions Regulator, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury and the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury. Transcripts of oral evidence and published written evidence can be found on our webpages. 7. We note also the valuable work of the Environmental Audit Committee in this field, most recently through its Third Report of this Session, Growing back better: putting nature and net zero at the heart of the economic recovery.10  9 10  Treasury Select Committee, ‘Decarbonisation of the UK economy and green finance inquiry relaunched’, accessed 11 February 2021 Environmental Audit Committee, Third Report of Session 2019–21, Growing back better putting nature and net zero at the heart of the economic recovery, HC 347  8  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  1 The economic opportunities and costs of net zero Green finance: an economic opportunity 8. In the Green Finance Strategy, launched in July 2019, the Government argued that “leadership on green finance will enable the UK to maximise the economic opportunities of the global and domestic shifts to clean and resilient growth.”11 9. The previous Committee heard evidence that decarbonising the economy could provide the UK with a substantial economic opportunity, both in terms of economic advantage that might be gained through new low carbon technologies, and globally, if the UK could establish the City of London as a leading centre for green finance and other green industries. We use the term “green finance” in this report to encompass the mobilisation of private finance for clean and resilient growth, the incorporation of climate and environmental factors within investment decisions, and the development of “green” financial products.12 10. Sagarika Chatterjee, Director of Climate Change, Principles for Responsible Investment,13 told us that “[…] there is still a very strong opportunity for the UK and the City of London to lead on this. There are strong commercial and trading opportunities, particularly from the green finance side. The City of London, as well as, more broadly, Edinburgh and many other areas of the UK, should be the No. 1 place for green finance”.14 11. Action to develop “green” finance in the UK could have consequences outside the UK, because of the international nature of the City. Positive Money, a not-for-profit research and campaigning organisation seeking to “make money and banking work for society”,15 told the previous Committee that while the UK is responsible for approximately 1% of global CO2 emissions, the City of London “hosts and finances companies which account for a minimum of around 15% of potential global CO2 emissions, and the financial carbon footprint of the UK is 100 times its own fossil fuel reserves”.16 12. John Glen MP, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, confirmed that there is “a significant appetite for people to invest in sustainable financial products”17 and that there were “new technologies that give us faster routes to that net zero goal”.18 Similarly, Kemi Badenoch MP, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, argued that there was also export potential: “If we can do this right and become world leaders in carbon capture storage, hydrogen and offshore wind, we can export these technologies […] There are benefits to making sure we get a march on and can be world leading in this space.”19 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19  HM Treasury and Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, Green finance strategy; Transforming Finance for a Greener Future, July 2019, p 6 HM Treasury and Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, Green finance strategy; Transforming Finance for a Greener Future, July 2019, p 7 - 11 Principles for Responsible Investment is an independent membership body for institutional investors supported by the United Nations Oral evidence taken on 2 July 2019, HC 2233 (2017–19), Q14 [Sagarika Chatterjee] Positive Money, ‘Making money and banking work for society’, accessed 8 April 2021 Positive Money, (DUE0063) para 4.3 Q253 Q253 Q253  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  9  Economic recovery: taking a “green” approach 13. The development of the UK as a centre for green finance is an opportunity which could be identified in advance and planned for. The coronavirus pandemic, on the other hand, was quite unforeseen; but it has in its way offered a quite different sort of opportunity, by forcing policymakers to think about how to build sustainability and “green” spending into planning for an economic recovery. This Report now looks at what the Government has already done in that respect, and what more it could do to co-ordinate that effort and to influence Government departments in planning their activities and spending so as to assist in meeting the net zero target. ‘Building back greener’ post coronavirus 14. While the Government’s focus over the last year has been the coronavirus pandemic, it has also prioritised achieving economic recovery in line with the UK’s net zero target. In June 2020, the Prime Minister committed the UK to “build back better, build back greener, build back faster”.20 Similarly, in his statement to the House on the Plan for Jobs in July 2020, the Chancellor announced that “this will be a green recovery, with concern for our environment at its heart, and as part of that, I am announcing today a new £2 billion green homes grant”.21 He went on to say that he was “releasing £1 billion of funding to improve the energy efficiency of public sector buildings, alongside a £50 million fund to pilot the right approach to decarbonise social housing”. He argued that this was therefore a “£3 billion green jobs plan to save money, cut carbon and create jobs”.22 15. The Prime Minister’s speech to the Conservative Party Conference in October 2020 highlighted the Government’s commitment to “the green economy, the green industrial revolution that in the next ten years will create hundreds of thousands if not millions of jobs” and announced plans for the UK to become a “world leader in low cost clean power generation”.23 In November 2020, the Prime Minister published a ‘Ten Point Plan’ for a green industrial revolution, which included a focus on “Innovation and finance”.24 The Chancellor of the Exchequer supported this commitment to a green industrial revolution with a number of ‘green’ spending commitments in the November 2020 joint Autumn Statement and Spending Review.25 16. We heard evidence which supported “green” spending measures as a means of supporting the UK’s economic recovery. Professor Nick Robins, Professor in Practice for Sustainable Finance, Grantham Research Institute, London School of Economics, noted that: … through the Covid crisis, we have seen a greater recognition, particularly from the financial sector but also from the corporate sector and the world of policy, that the way out of this crisis is to move in a more accelerated fashion to the economy of the future, one which is net zero, resilient and 20 21 22 23 24 25  “PM: A New Deal for Britain”, Prime Minister’s Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP, press release, 30 June 2020 HC Deb, 8 July 2020, col 976 [Commons Chamber] HC Deb, 8 July 2020, col 976 [Commons Chamber] The Conservative Party, ‘Boris Johnson: Read the Prime Minister’s Keynote Speech in full’, accessed 12 February 2021 “Prime Minister Boris Johnson outlines his Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution for 250,000 jobs”, Prime Minister’s Office, 10 Downing Street and The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP, press release, 18 November 2020 HM Treasury, Spending Review 2020, CP 330, November 2020, para. 29  10  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  more inclusive. We have a legal commitment to that in the UK, particularly to net zero. That would imply that we would want to see funds that are allocated to business in this crisis being done in a way that is consistent with net zero.26 17. Dr Emily Shuckburgh OBE, Director of Cambridge Zero, at the University of Cambridge, told us that “the key question is whether it is a cost to the overall economy. There is plenty of evidence, looking at past investments, that green investments give you a really strong multiplier in exactly these circumstances.”27 Dr Shuckburgh further noted that green investments made good economic and fiscal sense because “[…] if we do not look at putting in place both the jobs and the infrastructure that are relevant to the future, we will be putting money into things that are stranded, in the sense of jobs or assets that do not have any future”.28 18. We also heard evidence supporting the imposition of “green” conditions on the provision of recovery financing for businesses. Professor Robins told us that this could be done in two ways: either by looking at past performance and the carbon or pollution intensity of the business, or by linking to a company’s commitment to net zero and social commitments, such as retraining of workers.29 19. However, when asked about conditionality, Chris Cummings, CEO of the Investment Association, was more cautionary. He told us that: We are trying to strike the right balance between making sure that the businesses we are investing in are responding to climate change, and setting a course for correction and improvement where necessary, without imposing costs on them, particularly at this time, that could be difficult and could make the difference between the long-term sustainability we want and too much short-term pain.30 20. The Government’s main business lending programmes in the coronavirus crisis— Bounceback loans, Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) and Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CLBILS)—did not have “green” conditions attached to them. However, in its support to Celsa Steel (UK), Alok Sharma MP, then Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, told the House of Commons that the Government had agreed legally binding contractual conditions with Celsa on employment, climate change and tax.31 21. At Budget 2021, the Government announced a new “Recovery Loan Scheme” and set out how it would operate:32 The Recovery Loan Scheme is to help businesses of any size access loans and other kinds of finance so they can recover after the pandemic and transition period. 26 27 28 29 30 31 32  Q61 Q63 Q63 Q61 Q64 Written Ministerial statement, 2 July 2020, HCWS332 HM Treasury and Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, ‘Guidance: Recovery Loan Scheme’, accessed 9 April 2021  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  11  Up to £10 million is available per business. The actual amount offered and the terms are at the discretion of participating lenders. The government guarantees 80% of the finance to the lender. As the borrower, you are always 100% liable for the debt. The scheme is open until 31 December 2021, subject to review. Loans are available through a network of accredited lenders, listed on the British Business Bank’s website.33 22. At present, the Recovery Loan Scheme does not appear to have any green conditionality attached to it. However, in its submission to our inquiry, Barclays noted that: …via the British Business Bank, the Government already has a number of schemes in place designed to stimulate wholesale lending post COVID-19, e.g. the ENABLE guarantee, CBILS and CLBILS. With relatively simple tweaks, these schemes can be adapted to focus on net zero blended finance solutions. As a significant number of businesses focus on bridging their short-term needs through the COVID-19 pandemic, now is an ideal time for a focused, clear and green COVID-19 recovery program to marry up with the closing of the CLBILS/CBILS window in September.34 23. Although the Government has emphasised the need for a “green” recovery, we note it has not, except in limited circumstances, imposed green conditionality on the support it has provided during the coronavirus pandemic. Whilst it is clear that support schemes were required to be provided without delay the Treasury should set out why it did not include green conditionality for the Recovery Loan Scheme announced in the 2021 Budget.  Government decision making and the Net Zero Review 24. In November 2019, the Treasury launched its Net Zero Review,35 which will consider how the transition to net zero will be funded and will assess options for where the costs will fall. The terms of reference set out what this will involve: •  Analysing the range of choices for how households, businesses and the taxpayer could contribute towards different elements of the transition to net zero.  •  Identifying mechanisms to create an equitable balance of contributions.  •  Maximising opportunities for economic growth as we transition to a green economy  •  Evaluating the trade-offs between cost, competitiveness, effects on consumers and impacts on the taxpayer.  25. An interim Net Zero Review report was published in December 2020, which sets out the analysis undertaken so far, including on uncertainty of cost, policy levers, and 33 34 35  HM Treasury and Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, ‘Guidance: Recovery Loan Scheme’, accessed 9 April 2021 Barclays (DEC0052) p 2 HM Treasury, ‘Net Zero Review terms of reference,’ accessed 12 February 2021  12  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  household exposure, and seeks feedback ahead of the final report.36 The final report, which will build on the interim report and which will be published in spring 2021, will look at: •  Innovation and growth: How the government can reduce policy uncertainty to encourage innovation, technological development and investment. It will look at areas where the UK might have comparative advantage and consider how to maximise the economic benefits.  •  Competitiveness: The scope for addressing the risks of carbon leakage and competitiveness that may arise from the transition to net zero.  •  Household impacts: More detailed analysis of the implications for households from the decarbonisation of transport, buildings and power and options for managing any adverse impacts, as well as the trade-offs the government may face.  •  Embedding the findings: How HM Treasury could incorporate climate considerations into spending reviews and fiscal events and how to embed the principles of the Net Zero Review into policy making across government.37  26. In 2019, the Treasury also commissioned the Dasgupta review on the Economics of Biodiversity, to assess the economic benefits of biodiversity globally; the economic costs and risks of biodiversity loss; and to identify a range of actions to enhance biodiversity and deliver economic prosperity.38 The review’s final report, published in February 2021, covers the impact of human economic growth and development on nature. One of the report’s main conclusions is that nature’s importance is not reflected in market prices, which has led to underinvestment in the world’s natural assets. The report recommended, amongst other things: •  Changing measures of economic success to guide policymakers on a more sustainable path, including a measure of inclusive wealth which includes natural assets; and introducing natural capital into national accounting systems to improve decision-making; and  •  Ensuring that the financial system channels investment into economic activities that enhance the stock of natural assets.39  27. Separate to the Net Zero Review final report, the Government has also committed to providing a Net Zero Strategy40 which it says “will set out the Government’s vision for transitioning to a net zero economy, making the most of new growth and employment opportunities across the UK”.41  36 37 38 39 40 41  HM Treasury, Net Zero Review: Interim report, December 2020, p.3–5 HM Treasury, Net Zero Review: Interim report, December 2020, p 5–6 HM Treasury, ‘Collection The Economics of Biodiversity: The Dasgupta Review’, accessed 17 March 2021 HM Treasury, The Economics of Biodiversity: The Dasgupta Review Headline Messages, February 2021, p 4 HM Treasury, Net Zero Review interim report, December 2020, para 1.22 HM Government, The Government Response to the Committee on Climate Change’s 2020 Progress Report to Parliament, October 2020, p 6  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  13  Co-ordination of Government effort 28. We heard that achieving net zero by 2050 would require the Government to conduct joined-up and coherent decision and policy-making, with an important role to be played by HM Treasury. Baroness Bryony Worthington, environmental campaigner and Crossbench Life peer, told us that an integrated approach to decarbonising was necessary. She told us: The quality of our policies is imperative and the Treasury plays a central role in that, in ensuring we join up the parts of Government. […] we still spend a lot of money on certain sectors of the economy, including transport. We need to see an integrated strategy of transport infrastructure that hits multiple objectives: clean air, no greenhouse gases, and investment into our industries with sustaining jobs.42 She noted though that “some of the lack of joined-up thinking is within Departments. It is not just between Departments and the Treasury.”43 29. Lord Turner of Ecchinswell, Chairman of the Energy Transitions Commission, also emphasised the important role of the Treasury, saying that “Treasury is in charge of taxes and Treasury is in charge of public expenditure. Although there are many other tools of policy required to build a zero-carbon economy, what the tax regime is and what the public expenditure regime is are crucially important, so that needs to be integrated with the overall strategy.”44 30. The Government has made bold claims that the economic recovery will be a green recovery. In order to achieve that, the Government needs to set out in its Net Zero Strategy who, at ministerial level, will be responsible for delivering net zero, coordinating the roles of different departments, and ensuring that the UK remains on track to meet its net zero target in a cost-effective way. Spending reviews 31. We received evidence that the Government’s net zero target needs to be integrated into the Government’s spending decisions. Written evidence from the World Wildlife Foundation (WWF) proposed that the Treasury implement a ‘net zero test’ for spending decisions, including at spending reviews and annual budgets. WWF also proposed a Fiscal Resilience Rule as part of the Treasury’s fiscal framework review, which would “guide the decision-making process for the Comprehensive Spending Review”, and ensure “that all spending will be aligned with building the UK’s economic resilience”.45 WWF proposed that the rule would encourage fiscal policy to address future risks to the UK economy, including climate change. 32. The UK operates a system of carbon budgets: legally binding caps on greenhouse emissions over a five-year period.46 Shortly after carbon budgets were introduced under the 2008 Climate Change Act, Baroness Worthington wrote in the Guardian that: 42 43 44 45 46  Q2 Q5 Q3 World Wildlife Foundation (DEC0054) pp 1, 4, para 30 Climate Change Committee, ‘Advice on reducing the UK’s emissions’, accessed 9 April 2021  14  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  The principle behind carbon budgeting is simply that emissions must stay within a pre-determined limit or compensating actions, such as payment for emission reductions elsewhere, must be taken. This was meant to engender the feeling that every tonne counts, since allowing an emission to take place creates a liability against the budget, whereas, investing in emissions savings effectively creates an asset.47 However, Baroness Worthington told us that in the implementation of carbon budgets “one element that never really got implemented was that, if we are facing a deficit, as in we are not meeting our targets, there is a potential monetary value to that […]”.48 Baroness Worthington explained that “the point is getting the Treasury’s minds to think about this in terms of liabilities, as in if we do not meet our targets we are creating a liability, and assets, as in investments now that decrease that liability over time.”49 33. Kemi Badenoch MP, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, told us that it was her intention to hold departments to account for their net zero spending: “We cannot have a plan for net zero without Departments being fully engaged. It is a strategic priority […] All of the various Departments need to take account of which actions help us reduce emissions. This will be important to consider in the spending review. It will be an important part of wider fiscal strategy.”50 34. It remains unclear to us, however, what mechanisms are in place within the spending review process to provide incentives to departments to design their activity and spending so as to meet the Government’s net zero target; nor was it clear to us what the consequences would be for departments that did not do so. 35. In the Net Zero Review final report, the Government should set out what mechanisms it will put in place to integrate the net zero target within departments’ spending review commitments, and how departments will be held to account should they fail to meet their targets.  Uncertainty of costs 36. While a range of different estimates of the cost of achieving net zero have been produced, the overall cost remains uncertain. In June 2019, it was reported that the Rt Hon. Philip Hammond MP, then Chancellor, had suggested that the cost of net zero would reach £1 trillion, and that analysis by the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy had estimated the cost at £70 billion per year.51 37. We heard from Nick Mohlo, Director of Aldersgate Group, that: it is difficult to comment on the precise figure because of the uncertainty of looking 30 years out. There are obviously quite big uncertainties around what the cost of finance would be, which would have a big bearing on the overall cost.52 47 48 49 50 51 52  The dawn of carbon budgeting: now every tonne counts”, The Guardian, 14 July 2009 Q28 Q28 Q275 “UK net zero emissions target will ‘cost more than £1tn”, The Financial Times, 5 June 2019 Q6  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  15  Mr Mohlo added that his understanding of the Climate Change Committee’s analysis was that the UK “would be looking at an actual resource cost of 1% to 2% of GDP to get to net zero”. He explained that while there would be an increase in cost for some sectors, such as low-carbon heating, costs would fall in other areas of the economy, such as transport, where the Climate Change Committee estimated an annual reduction in cost of around £5 billion.53 38. Lord Turner of Ecchinswell told us that “it is not completely absurd” that the cost to achieve net zero by 2050 might be £1 trillion, but he noted that “by setting that figure up, you are making people think, “I have to find £1 trillion in the Budget to pay for that”.54 In his view, the cost would be apportioned across the time period “at the end of which, by 2050, people might have to accept being 1.5% worse off than they otherwise would be, which if we are growing our economy at 1.75%, means that they will reach, in December 2050, the living standard that they would otherwise have reached in February 2050”.55 39. We also received written evidence from the Global Warming Policy Foundation which set out concerns about the Government’s projected reliance on off-shore wind and its associated costs, and particularly that “no official costings of the net zero project have been published”.56 The Global Warming Policy Foundation called for the Treasury “to prepare and publish a detailed and publicly accessible costing of the project”57 and noted that the Foundation’s own calculations indicated costs approaching £4 trillion, or around £150,000 per household. 40. The Climate Change Committee now estimates in its Sixth Carbon Budget published in December 2020 that the annualised resource cost will be less than 1% of GDP per annum until 2050 but that this would not “necessarily reduce GDP by an equivalent amount”, as modelling suggested that the level of UK GDP “would be around 2% higher than it would have been by 2035 as resources are redirected from fossil fuel imports to UK investment”.58 The Sixth Carbon Budget outlines three possible scenarios which reflect uncertainties over “how far people will change their behaviours, how quickly technology will develop and the balance between options where credible alternatives exist”.59 41. The Treasury recognised the uncertainty of cost estimates in its Net Zero Review interim report, published in December 2020: … [the] amount of investment required to reach net zero and the consequential impacts on operating costs are difficult to estimate. They are affected by a range of factors, including the precise path of transition, changes in behaviour and the rate at which technology costs fall and efficiency gains made, all of which are subject to significant uncertainty.60 42. We received evidence on the difficulties of economic modelling and of estimating the costs. When asked whether the Treasury’s economic modelling facilitates the effective funding of environmental policies, Chris Stark, Chief Executive of the Committee on 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60  Q6 Q8 Q8 Global Warming Policy Foundation (DEC0009) pp 1–2 Global Warming Policy Foundation (DEC0009) p 2 Climate Change Committee, The Sixth Carbon Budget The UK’s path to Net Zero, (December 2020), p 21 Climate Change Committee, The Sixth Carbon Budget The UK’s path to Net Zero, (December 2020), p 24 HM Treasury, Net Zero Review interim report, December 2020, p 4  16  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  Climate Change, told the previous Committee that “the Treasury has several ways of modelling the economy. Some of those models are extremely appropriate and some are not.” He noted that the Treasury had considered net zero in recent years as a “spending pressure”; but in his view, this was not the most appropriate way to look at the issue, as the policies needed to get the UK to net zero were likely to be long-term. He argued that “if you view the policies that are necessary to get us to net zero in three or four-yearly periods as spending pressures, it is going to be extremely difficult to consistently make the arguments for those policies to be in place”.61 He said that the Treasury needed “to lift its horizons slightly”.62 43. Professor Nick Robins, Professor in Practice of Sustainable Finance at the London School of Economics, was critical of current modelling of both costs and benefits, and told the previous Committee: […] the current economic models, potentially including the Treasury’s, really underestimate the scale of the challenge around climate change in two profound ways. First, they underestimate the costs, because often they only price things that are measurable and we know that many of these things are hard to measure. Secondly, they have consistently underestimated the benefits of an innovation-led process of growth. […] that leads to unnecessary caution, both in viewing the challenge of climate change as smaller than it is and in downsizing the potential opportunity for the wider economy.63 44. We raised uncertainties about costs with Ministers. The Exchequer Secretary for the Treasury, Kemi Badenoch MP, recognised the inherent tension between achieving the UK’s net zero goal by 2050, and ensuring that it was achieved in a cost-effective way, saying that “the Government’s priority is that we do this in a way that is sustainable and not in a way that loses people their jobs or their livelihoods”.64 She also told us that the Treasury was still assessing where the costs for achieving net zero would lie, but she did say that “between businesses, taxpayers, and consumers, it is about making sure that the balance is fair”.65 When asked about the costs of not taking action, Ms Badenoch told us that while she recognised that the physical impact of climate change required action, “we have not got to a point where we have been putting a figure on it. That is something that we will be looking to do very soon in the future”.66 45. While Ms Badenoch committed to providing the methodology around the calculation of cost estimates of the transition to net zero, she noted that “I am not sure whether that is something that would be in the review itself. It would be quite difficult. I think we can provide in other forums ways of explaining the methodology”.67 However, Ms Badenoch committed to going “as far as we possibly can to show the working and be as transparent as we possibly can”,68 acknowledging that the “consequences could be catastrophic if we do not accurately estimate what the costs are going to be”.69 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69  Oral evidence taken on 2 July 2019, HC (2017–19) 2233, Q12 [Mr Chris Stark] Oral evidence taken on 2 July 2019, HC (2017–19) 2233, Q12, [Mr Chris Stark] Oral evidence taken on 2 July 2019, HC (2017–19) 2233, Q12, [Professor Nick Robins] Q247 Q248 Q254 Q266 Q266 Q267  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  17  46. The Chancellor should publish the Net Zero Strategy as soon as possible and should set out, in conjunction with the Net Zero Review final report, the principles upon which the UK will fund its transition to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. 47. There are a number of different estimates of the cost of achieving net zero by 2050. However, the Government has not yet committed to its own cost estimates and should set these out as soon as possible. The Government should include in the Net Zero Review final report its own methodology on costs; and it should set out clearly where the uncertainties lie. The Treasury should also include a range of scenarios on how net zero might be achieved, and the associated cost for each scenario.  Regional impact of transition to net zero on high carbon industries 48. The 2015 Paris Agreement, to which the UK is a signatory, states that signatories would “tak[e] into account the imperatives of a just transition of the workforce and the creation of decent work and quality jobs in accordance with nationally defined development priorities”.70 This was followed at COP24 in 2018, when the then Prime Minister signed the Solidarity and Just Transition Declaration Silesia, which reaffirmed the “imperatives of a just transition of the workforce and the creation of decent work and quality jobs” and recognised that “the circumstances of economic sectors, cities and regions that are most likely to be affected by the transition vary from country to country”.71 49. The Government’s Net Zero Review interim report, published in December 2020, recognised the likely differing regional impact of a transition, observing that it would “lead to significant changes in the structure of the economy” and that these changes would “have knock-on impacts on sectors, jobs and regions.”72 It acknowledged that “employment losses concentrated in high carbon sectors are possible if these sectors cannot adapt or absorb the costs of decarbonisation”.73 50. Some of our witnesses expanded on this point. Professor Robins, Professor in Practice of Sustainable Finance, Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics, told us that: Just transition is already part of the Paris agreement. We can translate that commitment in a policy sense, for example, when we come forward with the national infrastructure strategy, when we think about the skills and retraining that is going to be required. In terms of the regional dimension, the transition is not going to happen equally across the country. The country is very differentiated between rural, post-industrial and urban.74 51. Dr Daniel Klier, Group Head of Sustainable Finance at HSBC, observed that financial institutions were now running scenarios on their lending exposures to identify which geographies and sectors were most affected. Dr Klier said that “We need to do the same for the UK economy, to identify exactly what we mean, which industries and which parts of the economy are affected, and then launch a cluster strategy for those. Investors, banks and the wider community here will be able to act only if we point fingers at where we have concerns”.75 70 71 72 73 74 75  United Nations, Paris Agreement, (December 2015), p 2 COP 24 Katowice 2018, Solidarity and Just Transition Silesia Declaration, 2018 HM Treasury, Net Zero Review interim report, December 2020, para 2.27 HM Treasury, Net Zero Review interim report, December 2020, para 2.30 Q95 Q95  18  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  52. For the Government’s part, Niva Thiruchelvam, Deputy Director, Head of Net Zero Review at the Enterprise and Growth Unit in HM Treasury, told us that “The Net Zero Review is looking specifically at climate change mitigation and the optimal path to get to net zero by 2050. As part of that, we are looking at distributional issues [...], and a just transition is very much part and parcel of that”.76 53. The Treasury’s Net Zero Review final report should include clear sectoral pathways towards decarbonisation and should address the key policy decisions as to the future of high carbon industries. Particular attention should be given to the potential regional impact of those decisions, and the Government should set out a framework and strategy for supporting those communities which will be most impacted by these changes. This is especially important given the Government’s commitment to a Just Transition as part of the Paris Agreement.  76  Q312  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  19  2 Green finance to support decarbonisation The importance of utilising private finance 54. The Government’s Green Finance Strategy, published in 2019, was clear that private finance would have an important role to play in achieving the decarbonisation of the UK by 2050.77 It noted that: A strategy to green the financial system as a whole needs to be combined with specific actions to mobilise and accelerate flows of private finance into key clean growth and environmental sectors at home and abroad.78 The 2021 Budget reinforced that view, noting that the Government expects the private sector to provide the majority of investment needed to achieve net zero.79 55. The Government has acknowledged that the transition to net zero will require significant private finance. Witnesses endorsed this view,80 and we heard that the industry should be able to provide that finance.81 This Report now considers what will be needed to ensure that provision is as smooth and effective as possible, including: •  Long term policy certainty for investors;  •  Greening central banking;  •  Facilitating private investment through: green sovereign bonds; long term asset funds; proposed reforms to Solvency II; and the new UK infrastructure bank.  Long term policy certainty for investors 56. It has been suggested that in the past, Government policies have changed frequently, deterring low-carbon investment. Nick Mohlo, Executive Director of Aldersgate Group, a membership organisation promoting a competitive and environmentally sustainable economy, told us that: If you go back to some of the policy developments between 2010 and 2016, we saw a fairly high level of uncertainty across low-carbon investments. The levy control framework, which was the overall pot of funding allocated to renewable energy funding, was delayed on multiple occasions. The fourth carbon budget had been reviewed quite prematurely. The zero-carbonhomes requirement was cancelled in 2015, and that had very negative knockon impacts on the feeling of investment confidence, but also on the work of other Government Departments that had put a considerable amount of time into developing those policies in co-ordination with business.82 77 78 79 80 81 82  HM Treasury and Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, Green finance strategy; Transforming Finance for a Greener Future, July 2019, pp 2, 9 HM Treasury and Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, Green finance strategy; Transforming Finance for a Greener Future, July 2019, p 9 HM Treasury, Build Back Better: our plan for growth, CP 401, March 2021, p 91 Oral evidence taken on 2 July 2019, HC (2017–19) 2233, Q14, [Sagarika Chatterjee] ; Q101 Q101 [Dr Daniel Klier], Q85 [Chris Cummings] Q4  20  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  Mr Mohlo added that more of the off-shore wind infrastructure supply chain could have been based in Britain had it not been for that uncertainty. He told us that “a lot of the investment uncertainty of the time definitely had some negative impact on their perception of the UK as an investable market and it resulted in a smaller number of supply chain investments than we would otherwise have seen.”83 57. Chris Cummings, Chief Executive Officer of the Investment Association, also emphasised the importance of policy certainty to attract investment, adding: As the investment management industry, the one thing we love to invest in is infrastructure: long-term projects with known investment horizons. It is exactly the type of thing we get excited about. Successive Governments, unfortunately, have changed the policy direction, rules, incentives and so on, which makes it much harder for UK pension funds to invest in infrastructure.84 Mr Cummings further noted that “Policy certainty underpins all of this, making sure that Government are thinking long term, especially when thinking about green infrastructure and green investment.”85 58. The Government announced in Budget 2021 that the Treasury’s Net Zero Review is looking at how the UK Government can reduce policy uncertainty in order to encourage investment, alongside innovation and technological development.86 59. The Government has recognised that private finance will need to play a key part in funding the transition to net zero. If it is to do so, the Government will need to provide long-term certainty in climate-related policy and must ensure that consistent policy signals are sent to investors. We are encouraged that the Government acknowledged these needs in the 2021 Budget.  Green gilts 60. At the November 2020 Spending Review, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that the UK would issue its first green sovereign bond or ‘green gilt’.87 Green sovereign bonds can be defined as debt securities issued by governments where the proceeds raised are used to finance clearly defined projects which have environmental benefits.88 Following this commitment, the Treasury noted at Budget 2021 that: The government will issue its first sovereign green bond—or green gilt— this summer, with a further issuance to follow later in 2021 as the UK looks to build out a ‘green curve’. Green gilt issuance for the financial year will total a minimum of £15 billion. The green gilt framework, to be published in June, will detail the types of expenditures that will be financed to help meet the government’s green objectives. The government also commits to reporting the contributions of green gilt spending towards social benefits such as job creation and levelling up.89 83 84 85 86 87 88 89  Q4 Q79 Q108 HM Treasury, Build Back Better: our plan for growth, CP 401, March 2021, p 91 HM Treasury, “Chancellor sets out ambition for future of financial services”, accessed 12 February 2021 BMO Global Asset Management, Should the UK Debt Management Office issue green gilts? (August 2020), p 1 HM Treasury, Budget 2021, HC 1266, March 2021, Para 2.144, p 63  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  21  61. Despite the Government’s announcements on green gilts, in comparison to other European governments, the UK is lagging behind. Germany raised 6.5 billion euros from its first green sovereign bond in September 2020,90 while France issued its first green sovereign bond in January 2017 raising 7 billion euros. France’s green sovereign bonds are used to fund the government’s ‘Invest for the Future’ programme to “fight climate change, adapt to climate change, protect biodiversity and fight pollution”.91 62. This delay in the issuance of a green gilt may have come at a cost in developing other green bond issuance markets in the UK. Dr Daniel Klier, Group Head of Sustainable Finance at HSBC, highlighted that there was not yet a strongly growing sterling green bond market, as there is in dollars and euros, and noted that a benchmark bond issued by the Government was likely to be needed to unlock the sterling market.92 63. While we heard evidence from finance industry experts, including Chris Cummings, Chief Executive Officer of the Investment Association, that there would be investor appetite for a UK green gilt issuance,93 the Debt Management Office has also previously suggested to us that green gilts may mean raising finance at a premium compared with conventional gilts.94 64. However, some of our witnesses disagreed with this analysis. Professor Nick Robins, Professor in Practice for Sustainable Finance, Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics, told us that “it would be very plausible to issue something that could raise money at lower cost for the state”.95 Chris Cummings added that “having spoken to our members, I am not convinced that there would be a premium for these investments”.96 Dr Klier agreed, telling us that “at the moment, especially in Germany, we come in at prices that are below the market curve. I do not see any evidence for why we should be at a premium”.97 65. While John Glen MP, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, confirmed that there had previously been value for money considerations around sovereign green bonds, he noted that “market conditions have materially changed, […] and that is why we announced it.”98 66. We welcome the announcement in the 2021 Budget of a timetable for the issuance of the UK’s first green sovereign bond or ‘green gilt’. However, the UK is lagging behind other countries in the issuance of these green bonds. This runs the risk of holding back the development of a private sterling green bond market. Although concerns about the potential for green bonds to be a more expensive form of debt for the Government seem to have dissipated to a degree, the Government should none the less set out its tolerance, when issuing such bonds, for them to be more expensive than other forms of Government debt.  90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98  “Germany raises 6.5 billion euros from first ever green bond”, Reuters, 2 September 2020 Agence France Trésor, ‘Green OATs’, accessed 12 February 2021 Q109 Q65 [Chris Cummings], also Q109 Oral Evidence taken on 24 June 2020 HC (2019–21) 496, Q55–58 [Alison Thewliss, Sir Robert Stheeman] Q95 Q109 Q109 Q243  22  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  Greening central banking 67. As part of its monetary policy operations, the Bank of England operates a Corporate Bond Purchase Scheme (CBPS). The Bank describes the CBPS as follows: The Corporate Bond Purchase Scheme (CBPS or “the Scheme”) was launched in August 2016. It imparts monetary stimulus by lowering the yields on corporate bonds, thereby reducing the cost of borrowing for companies. It does this by triggering portfolio rebalancing into riskier assets by sellers of assets, and by stimulating new issuance of corporate bonds.99 The Asset Purchase Facility (APF) currently holds £20 billion of corporate bonds under the CBPS. This represents a small fraction of the total holdings of the APF, which is currently planned to reach £895 billion, and the total market of corporate bonds eligible for the Scheme, which amounts to £160 billion.100 68. These corporate bond purchases by the Bank may be being used to fund carbonintensive activity. This can be seen in the Bank’s own published Taskforce on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD)-compliant disclosures.101 In his foreword to those disclosures, the Governor of the Bank of England noted that: …the carbon intensity of our holdings of UK sterling corporate bonds (2% of the portfolio) reflects the position of the UK market generally. However, there remains a gap between the associated carbon outputs of these holdings and the Paris goals. This demonstrates the additional work needed to meet the UK’s goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.102 69. Positive Money, a campaign group seeking to “make money and banking work for society”,103 noted what the impact of these holdings meant for the net zero target: ‘Greening’ the Bank of England remains a key step in facilitating the transition to a Net Zero economy by ensuring financial flows are aligned with the government’s climate targets. As Britain’s central bank, the Bank of England is currently overseeing a financial system which is significantly out of step with the UK’s legally binding commitments under the Paris Agreement. As former Bank of England governor Mark Carney told the Treasury Committee in October 2019, the global financial system may be funding temperature rises of more than 4C, more than double the 1.5C aimed for in the Paris Agreement. Indeed, the Bank of England’s own asset purchases are currently aligned with a 3.5C increase in temperatures by the end of the century, which the Bank has defended as simply mirroring the market, which the MSCI Reference Portfolio suggests is funding 3.7C warming.104 99 100  101 102 103 104  Bank of England, ‘Asset Purchase Facility (APF): Additional Corporate Bond Purchases - Market Notice 2 April 2020’, accessed 9 April 2021 Bank of England, Bonds eligible for the Corporate Bond Purchase Scheme as at 3 September 2020’ (September 2020); Bank of England, Monetary Policy Summary and Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee meeting ending on 17 March 2021 (March 2021), p 1 Bank of England, The Bank of England’s climate related financial disclosure 2020, (June 2020) Bank of England, The Bank of England’s climate related financial disclosure 2020, (June 2020), p 1 Positive Money, ‘Making money and banking work for society (positivemoney.org)’, accessed 17 March 2021 Positive Money (DEC0060) para 3.1  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  23  70. In his appointment hearing in March 2020 with us for the role of Governor of the Bank of England, we asked Andrew Bailey about excluding fossil fuels from future bonds purchases. He told us: The original policy with the corporate bond programme was to hold essentially a portfolio that mimicked the corporate bond markets—in other words, it was a neutral portfolio. That was done deliberately. The Bank of England is not in there, picking companies; it is completely neutral. Whatever the market is, we hold the neutral portfolio. The question you rightly raise is whether we should shift that to say, “Given the public interest in climate change, we should shift the make-up of the portfolio to being one that is on the way to net neutral,” or however you want to define it. I think there is a very strong argument for doing that.105 71. Sarah Breedon, Executive Director for UK Deposit Takers Supervision at the Bank of England and its executive sponsor for work on climate change, emphasised this point. She told us that “what we have said we will do—and we will do—is think about how best to attach conditionality, working with Treasury, which needs to agree it, given that it decides our remit, for the corporate bonds we purchase as part of our quantitative easing approach.”106 72. At Budget 2021, the Chancellor provided the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England with a new remit letter, in which he amended its remit to reflect the importance of environmental sustainability and the transition to net zero: “I am today updating the MPC’s remit to reflect the government’s economic strategy for achieving strong, sustainable and balanced growth that is also environmentally sustainable and consistent with the transition to a net zero economy.”107 In response to this new remit letter, the Bank made the following announcement: In the coming months we will provide more information about our proposed approach to adjusting the Corporate Bond Purchase Scheme (CBPS) to account for the climate impact of the issuers of the bonds we hold, with a view to adapting our approach by the time of our next scheduled round of reinvestment operations in 2021 Q4.108 73. There has been criticism of this change of remit. Lord King, a former Governor of the Bank of England, told the House of Lords on 12 March 2021 that: When asset purchases commenced in 2009, the framework was established to ensure that the Bank did not become the arbiter of credit allocation among different sectors and different companies. But the new remit requires the bank to do just that, and to “reflect the importance of environmental sustainability and the transition to net zero”109 in its purchases of corporate bonds. Some may argue that this is a harmless gesture; after all, given the inflation outlook, it is far from obvious that there will be new asset purchases by the Bank. But what seems a harmless gesture today may prove 105 106 107 108 109  Oral evidence taken on 4 March 2020, HC (2019–21) 122, Q63 [Julie Marson, Andrew Bailey] Q117 HM Treasury, Remit for the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), March 2021, p 1 Bank of England, ‘MPC Remit statement and letter and FPC Remit letter, accessed 12 March 2021 HC Deb, 3 March 2021, col 259 [Commons Chamber]  24  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  damaging tomorrow. I know that climate change arouses passions, but that is no reason to embroil the Bank of England in what should be the responsibility of government. Climate change and declining biodiversity are serious issues that merit proper debate. Fiddling with the Bank of England’s remit, while at the same time taking no action on a carbon tax and freezing fuel duty again, are gestures, not a coherent policy. More importantly, they are the first steps on a slippery slope to undermining the independence of the Bank, and we cannot afford to lose that.110 74. We note the new remit provided to the Monetary Policy Committee, which will allow it to rebalance its Corporate Bond Purchase Scheme to take account of the climate impact of the bonds it holds. We will continue to scrutinise this process and will examine how any changes are enacted, and how those changes impact on the other policy objectives and the independence of the Monetary Policy Committee.  Long-term Asset Fund 75. We heard a proposal for reform to facilitate green finance from Chris Cummings, CEO of the Investment Association, who told us that his major recommendation for regulatory change was to create a new ‘long-term asset fund’: This is a new fund vehicle that we have been spending a lot of time talking to our friends at the Treasury and the FCA about, which allows retail investors and particularly DC pension funds to invest in infrastructure. […] It is a new fund structure, which is specifically designed to address the long-term investment issues.111 76. Sheldon Mills, then Interim Executive Director for Strategy and Competition at the Financial Conduct Authority, told us that: We are working closely with the Investment Association in relation to long-term asset funds and trying to ensure that we have the right balance of enabling that innovation in the market, getting coalition from asset managers and others around this new type of vehicle and having the right level of consumer protection and risk in relation to that, so that we have the right badges on it and, when those funds are potentially distributed, the right types of investors can come into them. I am not saying that they are made to be risky, but they are a different type of investment than retail investors might be used to. We are working very closely with the Investment Association, and we hope to finalise that as quickly as we can.112 77. In November 2020, the Chancellor announced the launch of a new type of ‘long-term asset fund’ which would allow pension savers to invest in infrastructure assets.113 In the same month, the Treasury, the Bank of England and the FCA convened a working group to facilitate investment in productive finance. The minutes of The Productive Finance Working Group Steering Committee note that: 110 111 112 113  HL Deb, 12 March 2021, col 1914 [Lords Chamber] Q77 Q175 HM Treasury, “Chancellor sets out ambition for future of financial services”, accessed 19 February 2021  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  25  The Working Group should draw on a large amount of existing work on the barriers to investment in productive finance. Its focus should be to identify practical ways to address both the operational and demand side barriers, and set out a clear roadmap for their implementation. This would support the Chancellor’s public commitment to set up a Long-Term Asset Fund (LTAF) later this year. The minutes also note that “a successful outcome for the Working Group would be to have facilitated the launch of at least one LTAF, with capital having been committed from a broad range of investors”.114 78. While in his proposal, Mr Cummings argued that such a long-term asset fund might be available to retail investors, this has been subject to debate at the Productive Finance Working Group Steering Committee. The January 2021 minutes note that: The Steering Committee discussed the intended target market for the LTAF [Long Term Asset Fund]. This will be an important question for the TEG [Technical Expert Group] to explore ahead of future Steering Committee meetings. Some members, whilst recognising that the LTAF was unlikely to be a product for the mass retail market, nonetheless, wanted an LTAF to be available to sophisticated segments of the retail market, as well as institutional investors. Others commented that, as this was a new product which would be investing in asset classes not traditionally available to retail investors in an open-ended structure, and which might require notice periods exceeding a year, it would not be suitable for most retail investors. Careful consideration, along with input from the advisory community, would be required about how it conforms to tax wrappers (for example, ISAs, SIPPs). One member noted that listings on exchanges can help provide access to retail investors. Given the challenges of distributing a new product to the retail market, some members thought the initial focus should be on delivering an LTAF for institutional investors (most notably large DC pension schemes), before facilitating access to retail investors at a later stage.115 79. When the Chancellor announced in November 2020 that this new type of ‘longterm asset fund’ would launch, he explained that it would do so within a year. However, the Investment Association recently announced that a regulatory consultation from the Financial Conduct Authority was required before any new fund could launch.116 80. We note the debate at the Productive Finance Working Group Steering Committee on retail access to the ‘long term asset fund’ (LTAF). There should be clarity about who will have access to the LTAF. The Chancellor and the financial regulators should set out the timeframe for the launch of the announced ‘long term asset fund’ to allow pension savers to invest in long-term projects. We would expect that such an LTAF would be focused on providing a net-zero compliant product. 114 115 116  Bank of England, The Productive Finance Working Group, Minutes of the first Steering Committee meeting, (Tuesday 26 January 2021), paras 3 - 4 Bank of England, The Productive Finance Working Group, Minutes of the first Steering Committee meeting, (Tuesday 26 January 2021), paras 20–21 Pinsent Masons, ‘Details of Long Term Asset Fund Revealed’, accessed 19 February 2021  26  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  Solvency II 81. We heard evidence that regulatory restrictions under Solvency II were preventing insurance companies from investing in long-term infrastructure assets. Solvency II is the European Directive on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance, which came into force on 1 January 2016.117 The Bank of England describes Solvency II as setting out the “regulatory requirements for insurance firms and groups, covering financial resources, governance and accountability, risk assessment and management, supervision, reporting and public disclosure”.118 82. Huw Evans, Chief Executive Officer of the Association of British Insurers, told us that: We have to support the Government and lobby them to change the Solvency II framework so that insurers are in a position to invest in a much wider range of sustainable ESG assets that fully meet the task of policyholder protection and of delivering sustainable returns over the long run, but that enable insurers to put their £2 trillion-worth of assets to much more sustainable and good use going forward.”119 This point was also emphasised by Aviva in its evidence to the previous Committee, where it argued that: Regulators should work to ensure that capital requirements reflect true longterm sustainability risks, and do not disincentivise long term sustainable investment. For example, Solvency II should be reformed so that it no longer discourages insurers from investing in green infrastructure.120 83. In October 2020, the Government announced a review of Solvency II and published a call for evidence.121 In his foreword to that call for evidence, the Economic Secretary noted that “The review will be guided by our objectives: to ensure a vibrant and prosperous insurance sector, to provide long-term capital to support growth, and to uphold high standards of policyholder protection and promote the safety and soundness of firms.”122 84. The Treasury should, as part of its review of Solvency II, consider reforms that could improve the funding of sustainable green infrastructure while maintaining the financial stability of insurers.  National Infrastructure Bank 85. On 25 November 2020, as part of the launch of the UK’s new National Infrastructure Strategy, the Chancellor of the Exchequer (the Rt Hon Rishi Sunak MP) announced a new UK Infrastructure Bank which will draw private finance investment into new infrastructure projects.123 The National Infrastructure Strategy described what the Bank 117 118 119 120 121 122 123  Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (Solvency II), 09/138/EC Bank of England, ‘Solvency II’, accessed 11 March 2021 Q187 Aviva Plc (DUE0048) para 3 HM Treasury, Review of Solvency II: Call for Evidence, October 2020 HM Treasury, Review of Solvency II: Call for Evidence, October 2020, p 1 HM Treasury, National Infrastructure Strategy, CP 329, November 2020, p 7  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  27  would do: •  Support the Government’s commitment to ‘levelling up’ and net zero;  •  Lend to local and mayoral authorities for key infrastructure projects; and  •  Provide advice on financing infrastructure, alongside offering debt, equity and hybrid products.124  86. Prior to this announcement, some witnesses to our inquiry had broadly supported a state-owned national investment or infrastructure bank.125 However, Professor Nick Robins, Professor in Practice of Sustainable Finance, Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics, reflected on the Green Investment Bank, the Government’s state-owned investment bank which invested in offshore wind, waste and biomass, energy efficiency and small scale renewables from 2012 until its sale in 2017.126 Mr Robins said that The Green Investment Bank was neither one thing nor the other. It was neither a classic, long term public infrastructure bank, like KFW in Germany or the European Investment Bank, and it was not a fully profitmaking private sector investor […].127 He noted that there would not be a role for “a niche green investment bank, but for what is called a policy bank, a national investment bank to support development of the Government’s economic policy”.128 87. The National Audit Office found in 2017 that the Green Investment Bank had invested in 100 projects, committing £3.4 billion of its own capital, and “had attracted £8.6 billion of private capital, equating to around £2.50 for every £1 invested”.129 While the Green Investment Bank attracted investment into the green economy, particularly into off-shore wind, its impact in other sectors was less certain. The National Audit Office recommended that when setting up companies the Government should set out criteria for judging success and develop a framework for evaluating performance, and should ensure that the company’s capital structure aligns with its objectives, and that there are clear arrangements for ongoing financing.130 88. Regarding the sale of the previous Green Investment Bank, Sir Amyas Morse, the former Comptroller and Auditor General said: Ultimately the value for money of the Green Investment Bank intervention will only be seen over time. A key test will be whether the Government needs to intervene again in this way to stimulate growth in the green economy and to help it achieve its climate change commitments.131 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131  HM Treasury, National Infrastructure Strategy, CP 329, November 2020, p 70 Q65 [Professor Nick Robins], Q74, Q211, Qq220–221 [Sandra Boss, Huw Evans] Green Finance Institute, The Role of a UK National Infrastructure Bank in a Green Recovery Insights paper, (December 2020), p 3 Q74 Q74 Report by the Comptroller and Auditor General, National Audit Office, The Green Investment Bank, HC (2017– 19) 619, para. 8 Report by the Comptroller and Auditor General, National Audit Office, The Green Investment Bank, HC (2017– 19) 619, para. 20 Report by the Comptroller and Auditor General, National Audit Office, The Green Investment Bank, HC (2017– 19) 619, para. 19  28  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  Only three years on from the sale of the GIB, the Government has decided it does again need to intervene in order to stimulate growth. 89. At Budget 2021, the Chancellor provided more detail on how the UK Infrastructure Bank would operate. He said that it: will have £22 billion of financial capacity to deliver on its objectives, consisting of £12 billion of equity and debt capital and the ability to issue £10 billion of guarantees. It will draw capital from HM Treasury and be able to borrow from private markets. It will also grow through recycling and retention of return on investments. The government will allocate capital to the Bank in phases in line with its institutional development.132 90. However, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) noted in its forecast that: As an EU member state, the UK received almost €120 billion (or £89 billion) in loans and equity from the EIB between 1973 and 2019. In the five years prior to the EU referendum in 2016, EIB lending averaged £5 billion a year, but it fell sharply in 2017 and was less than £1 billion a year in 2018 and 2019. The Government forecasts that the UKIB will lend and invest around £1½ billion a year (net of lending to local authorities that would otherwise have taken place through the Public Works Loans Board). This would be equivalent to around a third of the financing that was provided by the EIB prior to the EU referendum.133 91. While the Government acknowledged that the EIB had previously provided support to UK projects, it noted that an assessment from Vivid Economics for the National Infrastructure Commission134 “showed that a portion of EIB activity crowded out private investment” and that respondents to the Infrastructure Finance Review echoed this point. The Government’s view therefore is that “where the EIB provided support in well-financed areas, the government anticipates that the private sector will step in without public sector support”.135 92. Witnesses to our post-Budget 2021 evidence session were in agreement that the UK Infrastructure Bank’s proposed funding position was not big enough. Paul Johnson CBE, Director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told us that “If it is going to be effective, yes, it will need to be bigger. It is considerably smaller than the European Investment Bank, in the amount of money that that was making available. If you are serious about this in the longer run, it is going to have to be a bit bigger.”136 Rain Newton-Smith, Chief Economist at the Confederation of British Industry, agreed with Mr Johnson: “The initial pot of capital and equity is small. That will need to be scaled up over time. As you point out, it is much smaller than the German equivalent”.137 93. Mr Johnson also noted that while there might be a case for starting relatively small, he emphasised the need to focus on how the money is spent, how the institution is set up, and to be clear about the purpose of the UK Infrastructure Bank: 132 133 134 135 136 137  HM Treasury, UK Infrastructure Bank – Policy design, March 2021, p 4 Office for Budget Responsibility, Economic and fiscal outlook on Budget 2021, March 2021, Box 3.6 Vivid Economics, The role and impact of the EIB and GIB on UK infrastructure investment (May 2018), p 6 HM Treasury, UK Infrastructure Bank – Policy design, March 2021, para. 1.7 Oral evidence taken on 10 March 2021, HC (2019–21) 1196, Q196 [Dame Angela Eagle, Paul Johnson] Oral evidence taken on 10 March 2021, HC (2019–21) 1196, Q197 [Dame Angela Eagle, Rain Newton-Smith]  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  29  We need to be quite clear about quite what the purpose of these organisations is. […] which is really about lowering the risk for the private sector investment, reducing financing costs, possibly, on the green side, helping to create new investable asset classes and, in particular, being able sensibly to invest in early-stage long-horizon projects with high upfront costs and risks, the sort of things that are particularly important in the green economy.138 94. While the Government announced at the Spending Review in November 2020 that it intended that the UK Infrastructure Bank should be operational in an interim manner from spring 2021, and that it would legislate to put the Bank on a statutory footing,139 the Chancellor’s announcement at Budget 2021 suggested that a framework document providing further details on its operations would be published in the spring ahead of the UK Infrastructure Bank’s launch.140 95. In the proposed framework for the new UK Infrastructure Bank, the Chancellor should clarify its governance arrangements, how investment decisions will be made, and how it will ensure that it attracts sufficient private capital. In particular, it should clearly set out how the Bank will meet the Government’s commitment to Net Zero. The Government should also set out how it will incorporate lessons learned from the former Green Investment Bank, and whether it intends that the UK Infrastructure Bank should be funded to offer a lending facility at a level similar to that offered by the European Investment Bank before the UK referendum on membership of the EU.  138 139 140  Oral evidence taken on 10 March 2021, HC (2019–21) 1196, Q196 [Dame Angela Eagle, Paul Johnson] HM Treasury, National Infrastructure Strategy, CP 329, November 2020, p 70 HM Treasury, UK Infrastructure Bank – Policy design, March 2021, p 3  30  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  3 The role of consumers The importance of consumer choice 96. Consumer behavioural change, on a voluntary basis, will help to drive the transition to net zero, requiring both education and engagement. Consumer choice will be particularly important, so that people can make decisions that best suit their particular situation. 97. Community Energy England—which supports those committed to the community energy sector—told us that achieving net zero would require consumer ‘buy-in’, acknowledging that while “investment in Green Infrastructure and technology are vital, net zero cannot be ‘delivered’, only achieved with the consent and active participation of the people, not least because the Climate Change Committee estimates that 62% of all the measures it identifies as essential to achieving net zero are dependent on behaviour change”.141 In September 2020, the UK Parliament-sponsored Climate Assembly UK, which brought together people from all walks of life to discuss how the UK should meet the net zero target, published a report highlighting the importance of consumer choice in combating climate change, as it allows individuals to choose the best solution for them.142 98. The Treasury has also noted that interventions can make it easier for consumers to choose low-carbon options. In its Net Zero Review Interim Report, the Treasury states that: Facilitative levers seek to change the structure of the market or the way people make decisions in order to make it easier for households and firms to choose low-carbon options. These levers can complement carbon pricing by addressing the other market failures that hold back the process of decarbonisation. This can lower the overall costs of the transition, change who pays and who is able to cover the necessary costs.143 99. We consider below three elements that may have an impact on consumer choices around green finance: •  Consumer inertia or an inability to choose  •  Appropriate transparency and ‘Greenwashing’  •  Innovation  Consumer inertia and a lack of choice Defined contribution pensions 100. Consumer choice can only work as a lever if consumers utilise the choices available to them. Yet within pensions, consumers may not have choices, or where they do, they may not use them. We heard evidence that 96% of pension savers144 in defined contribution145 pension schemes are invested in their pension’s ‘default’ fund.146 141 142 143 144 145  146  Community Energy England (DEC0091) para. 2.5 Climate Assembly UK, The path to Net Zero - Climate Assembly UK Final Report, (September 2020), p.6 HM Treasury, Net Zero Review: Interim report, December 2020, p 49, para 4.15 Q188 Defined contribution pension scheme definition: “Defined contribution pensions build up a pension pot using your contributions and your employers contributions (if applicable) plus investment returns and tax relief”, Money Advice Service, accessed 15 February 2021 “A ‘default’ fund is the fund that members see their contributions invested in should they fail to make an alternative investment choice”, Default fund design in DC, accessed on 15 February 2021  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  31  101. Huw Evans, Chief Executive of the Association of British Insurers, told us that one of the key challenges in relation to ‘default’ funds was that of low consumer financial capability and the need for clear explanations about the options available to consumers.147 Mr Evans hoped that part of the solution might come from fintech,148 through the “development of more consumer-facing apps and opportunities for customers to engage with how their pension funds are managed”.149 102. Mr Evans, however, also highlighted a potential policy barrier against offering sustainable funds as a ‘default’ fund option for auto-enrolled pensions: The charge cap that we currently have in place for auto-enrol pension schemes is set at 0.75%. Nearly all ESG funds150 are above that because they involve active management, so they are more expensive to run. As long as you have a charge cap that does not allow for any exceptions, for example for ESG, you will find it hard to shift that. I would argue that there is a strong case in public policy terms for the charge cap having an exemption if there is an ESG component, to give people who are auto-enrolled in those funds to have the option to go above it.151 103. However, recent government announcements may mitigate this charge cap restriction to Environmental, Social, and Governance (‘ESG’) fund take-up in auto-enrolled pensions. In its Budget document Budget 2021, the Treasury noted that: The government will consult within the next month on whether certain costs within the charge cap affect pension schemes’ ability to invest in a broader range of assets. This is to ensure pension schemes are not discouraged from such investments and are able to offer the highest possible returns for savers. DWP will also come forward with draft regulations to make it easier for schemes to take up such opportunities within the charge cap by smoothing certain performance fees over a multi-year period.152 104. Anthony Raymond, General Counsel and Director of Legal Services, Policy and Advisory Directorate at the Pensions Regulator, told us that transparency would be “really important” in tackling default fund inertia, noting that defined contribution schemes now had to publish a statement of investment principles. Mr Raymond considered though that in the case of a default fund in an occupational pension scheme153 “to effect real change in this space, it is about ensuring that the trustee is doing the right things and considering the right issues”.154 Sheldon Mills, then Interim Executive Director of Strategy and Competition at the Financial Conduct Authority, took a similar view: 147 148  149 150  151 152 153  154  Q188 “Fintech” or Financial Technology is defined by the Bank of England as “technology-enabled financial innovation, which is changing the way financial institutions provide - and consumers and businesses use financial services”. Q190 Environmental, Social and Governance (‘ESG’) funds are defined by Robeco as: “portfolios of equities and/ or bonds for which environmental, social and governance factors have been integrated into the investment process”, accessed 15 February 2021 Q190 HM Treasury, Budget 2021, HC 1266, March 2021, para 2.147, p 64 Occupational pension scheme definition: “Workplace pension schemes or workplace pensions are pension schemes that are set up by employers to provide their employees with retirement benefits”, Pensions Advisory Service, accessed 15 February 2021 Q126  32  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  … what we need to think about, […] is whether the right mechanisms are in place so that that demand filters through into the choice sets that people have in things like pensions, and whether the right products are available […] that can go into default funds, so that either the mechanism demonstrates through transparency to pension holders that there is something there for them, or you can have greater choice at the point of entry. We need to think more closely about that with trustees.155 105. Mr Mills also explained that the Financial Conduct Authority had already taken some action in requesting Independent Governance Committees156 for workplace personal pensions schemes to ensure that Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) considerations were included in their assessment of investment mandates.157 However, Mr Mills acknowledged that with the increasing demand for ESG-related investments, “there must be more that we can now start to do to match this increasing demand, but also filter into the overall challenge of net zero”.158 106. When asked about the high proportion of consumers in default funds, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury told us that: … The pensions world is changing rapidly, and the Pensions Bill going through Parliament is going to make some progress, but the real challenge for the immediate term is to define what that green investment is and progress that at a wholesale and at a retail level, so that we can get more clarity on that. We will then make progress as the opportunities to invest a higher proportion in sustainable investments become clearer and more apparent.159 107. In a follow-up letter in December 2020, the Economic Secretary noted the interventions the Government had made in this area, and he told us that “whilst we welcome pension saver engagement and consumer choice, it should never be necessary to switch out of the default to invest sustainably”. However, he did not advocate mandatory targets, telling us that: Mandatory climate targets would mean that pension scheme governance bodies would be in a position where they are forced to choose between making the right investment decision for their members and breaching legislation. The easiest way to protect themselves in this situation—and, under threat of penalty, the most likely action—is divestment. However, uncoordinated divestment will not help us reach our net zero goal, as the stock could be bought up by other investors and emissions will not be curbed. Pension scheme trustees and savers will remain exposed to the consequences of those high emissions whilst having less ability to hold the emitters to account. 155 156  157 158 159  Q126 Independent Governance Committee definition: Financial Conduct Authority rules “require that firms that operate workplace personal pensions schemes to establish and maintain Independent Governance Committees (IGCs). IGCs have a duty to scrutinise the value for money of the provider’s workplace personal pension schemes, taking into account transaction costs, raising concerns and making recommendations to the provider’s board as appropriate. IGCs must act solely in the interests of relevant scheme members; act independently of the provider.”, Financial Conduct Authority, accessed 15 February 2021 Q126 Q126 Q306  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  33  Rather, the Government supports a whole economy transition, where duties land equally on all participants in the investment chain. Pension schemes and pension savers—many on low to moderate incomes—should not be singled out for blunt targets in an ineffective effort to fund the transition. This is a much less equitable outcome than the use of disclosure, regulation, and public investment which Government is already committed to.160 108. There is a high level of inertia amongst consumers around defined contribution pension fund choice, with most remaining in the ‘default’ fund. The Treasury has been robust in its view that default funds should not be required to move to more green alternatives, but at the same time maintains that consumers should not have to switch out of the default fund to invest sustainably. The Government should resolve this apparent contradiction. At present the Treasury is relying on a blend of disclosure, regulation and public investment to foster a transition towards more sustainable investment. For now, we support that approach, but the Treasury should report regularly on the proportion of pension holders in defined contribution pension schemes who remain in the default fund, and the extent to which those default funds are aligned with a path to Net Zero. Requirements on workplace pension scheme trustees 109. Consumers with Defined Benefit pensions are unable to choose how their assets are invested, creating an absence of consumer choice as a driver of change. They are therefore reliant on the pension scheme trustees to consider material climate-related financial risks, and to invest sustainably. 110. The Pension Schemes Act 2021161 (‘the Act’) is intended to support the Government’s expectation, set out in the Green Finance Strategy, that all large asset owners will make disclosures in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) by 2022.162 Section 124 of the Act amends the Pensions Act 1995 so as to provide for regulations which “may impose requirements on the trustees or managers of an occupational pension scheme of a prescribed description with a view to securing that there is effective governance of the scheme with respect to the effects of climate change”.163 111. In September 2020, Anthony Raymond, General Counsel and Director of Legal Services, Policy and Advisory Directorate at the Pensions Regulator, told us that the Act would make a real difference, as the TCFD requirements would be put on a statutory footing. He noted that the Act would also include regulation-making powers which would be an area of focus for the regulator.164 112. We note that the UK Sustainable Investment and Finance Association (UKSIF) found large-scale non-compliance among trustees with the previous regulatory expectations on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) considerations set by the Pensions Regulator.165 Although Mr Raymond told us that of the schemes reviewed by UKSIF “only 160 161 162 163 164 165  HM Treasury, Letter to the Chair of the Treasury Committee from the Economic Secretary, Decarbonisation of the UK economy and green finance inquiry, 16 December 2020, paras 11 - 13 Pension Schemes Act 2021 received Royal Assent on 11 February 2021 Explanatory Notes to the Pension Schemes Bill [HL], 16 July 2020 [Bill 165 (2020)-EN], para 29 Pension Schemes Act 2021, Section 124(2) Q118 Q134; UK Sustainable Investment and Finance Association, ‘Changing course: how pension trustees are responding to climate change and ESG’, accessed 15 February 2021  34  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  nine of the 45 schemes were within the purview of the legislation at that point”,166 he acknowledged that the Pensions Regulator needed to be clear with the industry and engage with them. However, Mr Raymond also noted that supervisors had been trained on “the sorts of things they need to be looking out for when they are engaging with schemes, and where necessary, enforcement”.167 113. Mr Raymond explained that although the governance of larger pension schemes tended to be better, and were better equipped to deal with ESG issues, “we have systemic issues across the pensions landscape in terms of large numbers of small DC [Defined Contribution] schemes […] over 30,000, with 6,000 or so DB [Defined Benefit] schemes”.168 114. The Department of Work and Pensions first consulted on ‘Taking action on climate risk: improving governance: improving governance and reporting by occupational pension schemes’ in August 2020.169 In its follow-on consultation in early 2021, on the new regulations to be made under the Pension Schemes Act 2021, the Government confirmed that primarily larger pension schemes would initially be subject to mandatory climate change governance and TCFD reporting requirements: (a) trust schemes with £1 billion or more in relevant assets (b) authorised master trusts; and (c) authorised schemes providing collective money purchase benefits.170 115. The Government acknowledges that industry responses to the first consultation most commonly “suggested that the asset threshold should move down rapidly to below £1bn” and that a significant number of respondents suggested that “smaller schemes might be encouraged to implement the climate governance requirements voluntarily in the first instance, or perhaps on a comply or explain basis.”171 116. The Government has confirmed that it will consult again in 2024 before deciding whether to extend the regulations to pension schemes with less than £1 billion in assets.172 However, in the interim this will leave smaller pension schemes outside the scope of the regulations and these pension savers outside the trustee obligations envisaged by the Pension Schemes Act 2021. 117. Consumers who hold defined benefits pensions have no choice as to how their assets are allocated. They rely upon their trustees. We note that previous attempts to get defined benefit schemes to acknowledge Environmental Social and Governance concerns have not been entirely successful. In its phased approach to implementing the regulations, the Pensions Regulator will need to consider how to reach smaller pension schemes. The draft regulations appear to exclude the smallest trust schemes. 166 167 168 169 170 171 172  Q134 Q134 Q134 Department for Work and Pensions, ‘Taking action on climate risk: improving governance and reporting by occupational pension schemes’, accessed 11 April 2021 Department for Work and Pensions, Taking action on climate risk: improving governance: improving governance and reporting by occupational pension schemes, January 2021, p.19–21, 26, para 8 Department for Work and Pensions, Taking action on climate risk: improving governance: improving governance and reporting by occupational pension schemes, January 2021, p.27–28, paras. 18–19 Department for Work and Pensions, Taking action on climate risk: improving governance: improving governance and reporting by occupational pension schemes, January 2021, p.21  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  35  However, when their effects are aggregated, they may still have an impact on meeting the net zero target. In responding to this Report, the Government should set out how these smaller funds will be encouraged to integrate climate governance and reporting requirements.  Appropriate transparency for consumers and ‘Greenwashing’ Greenwashing 118. For consumers to make effective choices they will need clear information to be able to do so, and such information will need to be appropriate for all consumers. In its Net Zero Review: Interim Report, the Treasury observed that: Measures to improve information about low-carbon choices can help drive consumer and producers towards alternative products. Examples include information and educational campaigns; government advice centres and online support services; and mandating improved labelling to help drive consumer and producer choices towards low-carbon alternatives. They usually come at low fiscal costs and can increase businesses’ accountability to consumers for their emissions. However, they can come with high compliance costs for businesses.173 119. However, we heard evidence that ‘greenwashing’—where products or funds are labelled as ‘green’ or sustainable but may not be so—may be an issue, with the potential to mislead consumers and cause capital misallocation. 120. The industry itself appeared aware of the danger that ‘greenwashing’ presented. Chris Cummings, representing the Investment Association, told us that: From that reputational point of view, ours is an industry that takes its responsibilities incredibly seriously on this. We understand completely the dangers of being accused of greenwashing. Part of the challenge is finding investible projects, investible companies, that have a good story to tell and are committed to transitioning. The danger we are all aware of is greenwashing: finding something that looks a bit green and promoting it as a green success story. That undermines everything we are trying to achieve.174 121. Dr Daniel Klier, Group Head of Sustainable Finance at HSBC, outlined the dangers that ‘greenwashing’ may pose. He drew our attention to an annual investor survey that suggested that 80% of respondents considered that lack of disclosure and consistent definitions held back further investment into sustainability and the energy transition.175 Professor Nick Robins, Professor in Practice of Sustainable Finance, Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics, agreed that data would allow investors to distinguish between assets and understand “which investments and assets are aligned to the transition”176 to net zero.  173 174 175 176  HM Treasury, Net Zero Review: Interim Report, December 2020, p 50, para 4.15 Q67 Q68 Q68  36  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  122. However, Saker Nusseibeh, Chief Executive Officer of Federated Hermes International,177 took a more optimistic view of what ‘greenwashing’ might represent and told us that: … greenwashing is at least an acknowledgement by the industry that it is important, that society thinks it is important, and that the regulator thinks it is important to reduce carbon footprint. That must be a first step. The second step is to have the taxonomy and the regulation to winnow away the truth from that which is less true.178 123. When asked about the importance of greenwashing, Sheldon Mills, Interim Executive Director of Strategy and Competition at the FCA, replied: We do focus on greenwashing, quite a lot from the consumer perspective, in terms of what is being delivered to consumers and the types of products or funds they are investing in. There are two ways we interact with either funds or products within our system. One is through our authorisations work. If a fund is being authorised with us and it pertains to be an ESGrelated fund, we will look at that to see whether that is going to be clear, fair or misleading. Is it what it says on the tin? We have seen instances where what the fund says it is investing in does not really stack up with it being ESG.179 However, he also noted the limits of the FCA’s remit: In one sense, it is absolutely apposite to say that, if ESG is so broad that funds go into things like greening fossil fuel companies a little bit, we might not necessarily meet some of the goals, if the funds are not going into new and innovative businesses that are really driving change in relation to those goals. That is not entirely our role. Our role is, in a sense, to look to make sure that the fund does what it says on the tin, and that has been our focus.180 124. The financial services industry broadly accepts that ‘greenwashing’ is detrimental to good consumer outcomes and to the achievement of the net zero goal. The Treasury must work with the FCA to ensure that the regulator has the appropriate remit, powers and priorities, and uses its powers, to prevent ‘greenwashing’ of financial products available to consumers. 125. We consider later in this Report, at paragraph 184, what steps might be taken to implement a UK ‘green’ taxonomy, which could help to give more assurance that financial products which are marketed as “green” are indeed contributing to the transition to net zero. Climate risk labels 126. In line with the potential for mandating improved labelling cited by Treasury in its Net Zero Interim Review “…to help drive consumer and producer choices towards 177 178 179 180  Federated Hermes International is an asset manager Q196 Q119 Q120  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  37  low-carbon alternatives”,181 Huw Evans, Director General of the Association of British Insurers, told us that “if we are talking about retail investors as opposed to institutional investors, we have to have a very straightforward set of explanations that do not mislead and that enable those customers to fully understand the potential risks as well as the potential rewards, to go alongside their motivation.”182 127. Some firms are already providing carbon labels on their products. Sandra Boss, Global Head of Investment Stewardship at BlackRock told us that: “[…], all our EMEA183 funds are now labelled with their carbon intensity. That is something we are doing worldwide. We are really trying to help people see the sustainability content of the product they are buying. That will help as well. Hopefully, ultimately, they will also get those long-term savings goals.”184 128. In February 2020, Andrew Bailey, then Chief Executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, told us that a ‘visual rating system’ to disclose the carbon footprint of financial products could be considered, but he believed that a “comprehensive approach would currently be challenging”. He identified data and methodological limitations, such as difficulties in sourcing appropriate data inputs; insufficient and inconsistent issuer-level disclosure; and the lack of an agreed set of standards, metrics and criteria for defining sustainable activities. Mr Bailey then referred to other product label initiatives, including the EU’s development of an ‘eco label’, and UK industry plans by the Investment Association and the British Standards Institution to consider product labels.185 129. We asked the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, John Glen MP, whether labelling of funds or indices should distinguish between ‘green’ funds investing only in renewables and those focused on transition finance which could include polluting companies. He responded that “To what extent signposting and labelling of funds would need to be adjusted is a technical matter and you would need to look very carefully at what industry says”.186 130. Financial products should be clearly labelled to allow consumers to assess the relative climate impacts of products and to make choices accordingly. However, allowing every firm to create its own consumer sustainability labels may lead to inconsistencies and consumer confusion. The Treasury and the Financial Conduct Authority should consult on the merits of making climate or carbon labels for consumer financial products mandatory, as a means to encourage innovation. The FCA should consult on how best to make such labels readily and widely understood. Passive investments and indices 131. Indices, such as the FTSE 100, are an important part of the investment landscape. They sit at the heart of passive tracker funds (in which investments simply track an index), which have risen in popularity.187 However, we heard two concerns related to indices in 181 182 183 184 185 186 187  HM Government, Net Zero Review Interim Report, December 2020, para. 4.15 Q188 Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) Q195 Financial Conduct Authority, Letter from CEO of FCA to Chair regarding Climate Risk, 24 February 2020, p 3 Q310 “Passive funds’ share of European investment market jumps to 20%”, Financial Times, 8 December 2020  38  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  terms of green finance, and which reflect the concerns already discussed in this report around consumer choice. They are that: •  popular indices such as the FTSE 100 may contain high carbon assets;188 and  •  Indices that purport to be ‘green’ or ESG compliant may have constituents that appear not to match that label.  132. On the importance of indices, the previous Committee heard evidence from Simon Howard, Chief Executive of the UK Sustainable Investment and Finance Association, in which he explained that this was also an issue for pension funds as most “will benchmark their fund manager’s performance against a benchmark index, so indices are vitally important”.189 133. In December 2019, the Guardian reported that the FTSE4Good indices, designed as sustainable investment indices with clearly defined ESG criteria, had added oil companies including Rosneft Oil and ConocoPhillips (13th and 15th largest oil companies by market capitalisation) to the FTSE4Good index. The Guardian noted that the public factsheets showed that 65 oil and gas companies were present on FTSE4Good’s emerging and developed markets indices.190 134. Rachel Haworth, UK Policy Manager at ShareAction, a charity promoting responsible investment, told the previous Committee that: We need to ensure that we are promoting fossil fuel free indices. They need to be mainstreamed. They need to be the default option, because otherwise, as long as we have these kinds of small technical issues that completely change the way markets are functioning, nothing is going to change substantially.191 135. We put to Sheldon Mills, Executive Director of Competition and Consumers at the Financial Conduct Authority, concerns around investment indices, and in particular the FTSE4Good index. He replied: We do not have significant concerns, other than that from a general viewpoint we would expect the indices to seek to ensure that they are transparent as to what is on them. I cannot speak to that specific index, but there should be a level of transparency so that people can take the right choice based on the information available to them.192 136. On whether indices should be clearly marked, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, while noting the role of transparency and the education of finance professionals, told us that: The Benchmarks Regulation (the regulation governing investment fund indices) includes disclosure requirements concerning how benchmark administrators take into account Environmental, Social and Governance factors. In 2019, two new categories of “climate-related benchmarks” were 188 189 190 191 192  “FTSE trackers expose investors to ‘stranded assets’, Citywire, 1 November 2016, Oral evidence taken on 8 October 2019, HC (2017–19) 2233, Q91 [Mr Baker, Simon Howard] ‘FTSE leaves coal and oil firms and G4S on ethical investment list’, The Guardian, 22 December 2019 Oral evidence taken on 8 October 2019, HC (2017–19) 2233, Q93 [Mr Baker, Rachel Haworth] Q121  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  39  also introduced under the Benchmarks Regulation. “Climate Transition Benchmarks” (CTBs) must be constructed so that the underlying assets are on a decarbonisation trajectory, while “Paris-Aligned Benchmarks” (PABs) must be constructed so that the underlying assets are aligned with the objectives of the Paris Climate Agreement. Together, these standards will enhance the transparency and comparability of “low carbon” benchmarks to enable investors to make more informed decisions.193 137. We note the concerns expressed about indices, in that the most popular may be carbon-intensive, and those that purport to be green may have carbon-intensive constituents. The risk remains that many consumers are unaware of the carbonintensity of the indices that their passive investments are tracking. The Treasury and regulators should therefore ensure that all indices (whether conventional or climatefriendly) clearly set out the overall carbon footprint of the assets included within indices. 138. On the concerns around the constituents of indices described as ‘green’, we note the requirements under the Benchmarks Regulation, which should be used to help consumers make better choices. However, it is clear that in some cases the labels or descriptions of ‘green’ or ‘climate-related’ indices do not necessarily match legitimate consumer expectations of what they would commonly be understood to mean. The Treasury and FCA should review the provisions in the legislative and regulatory framework and ensure that the labels and descriptions of indices accurately reflect their content, in line with consumer expectations.  Green product innovation 139. One of the ways consumer choice might be improved within Green Finance may be through innovation. One of the aims set out by the Government for its Green Finance Strategy was to “position the UK at the forefront of green financial innovation and data and analytics”. It would do this by “creat[ing] an environment that catalyses UK innovation in green finance products and services, including data and analytics, in collaboration with regulators, industry, and academia”.194 140. The Green Finance Strategy also provided the following description of the UK’s record in this area: The UK has a strong record in green financial innovation ranging from Yieldcos, green bonds and environmental, social and governance (ESG) Exchange Traded Funds listed on the London Stock Exchange Group to green mortgages and retail investment platforms.195 141. In July 2019, the Government implemented a key recommendation of the Green Finance Taskforce and launched the Green Finance Institute (GFI). Envisaged as the “UK’s principal forum for collaboration between the public and private sector with respect to green finance”, it is intended to form an integral part in delivering the Government’s 193 194 195  HM Treasury, Letter from Economic Secretary relating to Decarbonisation and Green Finance, 16 December 2020, para. 14 -17 HM Treasury and Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, Green finance strategy; Transforming Finance for a Greener Future, July 2019, pp 10, 55 HM Treasury and Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, Green finance strategy; Transforming Finance for a Greener Future, July 2019, p 10  40  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  Green Finance Strategy.196 The GFI states that it works with policymakers, industry and academics, and that “in convening and leading action-focused coalitions, we foster the design and promote the launch of innovative financial mechanisms that create commercial revenue opportunities”.197 142. The Government has shown recent innovation, in announcing at Budget 2021 that the Government will offer a green retail National Savings & Investment product in the summer of 2021. The product will “give all UK savers the opportunity to take part in the collective effort to tackle climate change […]”.198 143. Dr Daniel Klier, Group Head of Sustainable Finance at HSBC, provided this description of when public money should be used to stimulate innovation: The place where public money is needed is in technologies that are not yet ready for market. Wind is a very good example where the UK was a world leader by creating a framework that made the technology market ready and then it was time to withdraw any subsidies. If we think about the long list of technologies—hydrogen and electric vehicles, and at some point we can talk about lowemission aviation and the like—those are technologies where public money is needed to bring them to the place where they are commercially viable. At the moment, private money does not flow, unless you are an extraordinary risk taker who seeks an extraordinary return at the end. Those are the technologies where public money is needed, and the public also needs to be educated enough to withdraw subsidies at the point when it is ready for commercial application.199 144. Bruce Davis, Chief Executive Officer of Abundance Energy,200 told the previous Committee that it had taken his company two years to become authorised by the Financial Services Authority [predecessor to the Financial Conduct Authority] and that green finance innovation was difficult. Mr Davis explained that this was because “It is long term, it requires understanding of assets […] We are not seeing the credit knowledge and expertise spread as widely as it could be, to bring down the costs of capital and speed the flow.”201 145. Mr Davis also noted that although Barclays’ green mortgage product had retrospectively shown “that people who make that decision are a better credit risk”,202 this knowledge had not been developed to create a “green Experian [Credit Reference Agency]”.203 Mr Davis similarly noted that residential retrofits (such as installing solar panels or insulation) did not yet signal a higher market value on the housing market and “do not provide the sort of returns that you can get from […] a kitchen refurbishment”.204 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204  Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, ‘Guidance Green finance Transition to a green financial system and mobilising investment in clean and resilient growth’, accessed 18 March 2021 Green Finance Institute, ‘Our work’, accessed 18 March 2021 HM Treasury, Budget 2021, HC 1226, March 2021, para 2.145 Q85 Abundance Energy is an investment platform facilitating investments in sustainable projects Oral evidence taken on 8 October 2019, HC (2017–19) 2233, Q85 [Mr Streeting, Bruce Davis] Oral evidence taken on 8 October 2019, HC (2017–19) 2233, Q85 [Mr Streeting, Bruce Davis] Oral evidence taken on 8 October 2019, HC (2017–19) 2233, Q85, [Mr Streeting, Bruce Davis] Oral evidence taken on 8 October 2019, HC (2017–19) 2233, Q85, [Mr Streeting, Bruce Davis]  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  41  146. In relation to insurance, Huw Evans, Chief Executive Officer of the Association of British Insurers, told us that the industry was beginning to make more use of ‘resilient repair’, in which homes in high flood risk areas are repaired in a way that is resilient to future flood incidents, and suggested that “use of apps, greater knowledge, and more specific data modelling about incidents of flooding”205 would enable customers to buy products that were more responsive to their flood risk. 147. The pace of innovation still appeared laggardly to some who gave evidence. Legal and General told us that “green financial products for retail customers (eg mortgages, though we have recently launched an equity release product with additional cashback for green housing modifications) have not developed quickly enough.”206 Barclays, when considering business investment, noted that: There are already a number of green products available in the marketplace that are contributing to the net zero goal, including ‘use of proceeds’ loans which are relatively easy to identify (e.g. for Wind, Solar etc.). However, more needs to be done in the corporate space, where an appropriate incentive structure is required to encourage small, medium and large corporates to select projects that will advance net zero (e.g. opting for electric vehicles or sustainable supply chains, or focusing on the reduction of emissions).207 148. In its October 2018 Discussion Paper Climate Change and Green Finance, the FCA noted that “the FCA has a clear role to ensure markets for green finance are open to new entrants and innovation, enabling successful firms to thrive and deliver better outcomes for consumers.”208 Sheldon Mills, Interim Executive Director of Strategy and Competition at the Financial Conduct Authority, told us that: To excite consumers you need exciting products. If you want to excite the youth, you need apps that tell you how your investments might relate to ESG, et cetera. We, in 2019, had our green fintech challenge. We selected nine products. Some of them have even gone to market, which is fantastic. We are encouraging innovation to come in through the door, and working through how we can remove regulatory barriers, so we can have ESGrelated financial services products growing up.209 149. The Government’s Green Finance Strategy noted the need for innovation in green finance products and services, yet the evidence we have received suggests that the pace of innovation could be accelerated and that more could be done to encourage take-up. The Financial Conduct Authority should seriously consider undertaking further “green fintech challenges” to encourage innovation. The regulator should also set out how it will tackle remaining regulatory barriers which discourage innovative ‘green’ financial products from coming to market. The Government and the regulators should work more closely with the Green Finance Institute to bring innovative ideas which will benefit consumers to the market. 205 206 207 208 209  Q203 Legal and General (DEC0120) p 5 Barclays (DEC0052) p 2 Financial Conduct Authority, Climate Change and Green Finance Discussion Paper DP18/8, (October 2018), p9, para 4.4 Q161  42  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  4 Regulators and regulation 150. Regulation will play a key role in meeting the net zero target. In this chapter, we consider: •  The remit of the regulators;  •  Prudential risks and the capital regime;  •  Climate-related financial disclosures and a suitable taxonomy to encourage transparency.  Remit of the Prudential Regulation Committee and the Financial Conduct Authority 151. The Government’s Green Finance Strategy in 2019 recognised the role that the financial regulators—Bank of England, Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and the Pensions Regulator (TPR)—will play in greening the UK financial system.210 In that Strategy, the Government made the following commitment: For the Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority, we will ensure that the need to have regard to the COP21 Paris Agreement when considering how to advance their objectives and discharge their functions is reflected in the next Letter of Recommendations that HM Treasury issues to each authority.211 152. Witnesses supported amending the remit letters to the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority, to take account of climate change.212 Following our query as to the delay behind issuing updated remit letters to the regulators, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury confirmed in November 2020 that the remit letters for the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority would be updated, and that it was “an urgent priority for us to get this right”.213 153. We therefore welcome the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s recent letters to the Financial Conduct Authority214 and to the Prudential Regulation Committee215 amending their remits to “have regard to the government’s commitment to achieve a net-zero economy by 2050 under the Climate Change Act 2008 (Order 2019) when considering how to advance its objectives and discharge its functions”. 154. The Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority should move quickly to incorporate their revised remits to include climate change. We will continue to monitor their progress and ongoing approach to the risks arising from climate change. 210 211 212 213 214 215  HM Treasury and Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, Green finance strategy; Transforming Finance for a Greener Future, July 2019, p 8 HM Treasury and Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, Green finance strategy; Transforming Finance for a Greener Future, July 2019, p 22 Qq232–234 Qq278–279 HM Treasury, Letter of Recommendations for the Financial Conduct Authority, 23 March 2021 HM Treasury, Letter of Recommendations for the Prudential Regulation Committee, 23 March 2021  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  43  Prudential risks and the capital regime 155. We heard evidence about the underlying prudential risks from financial firms’ continued investment in fossil fuels and the associated ‘stranded assets’ risk. Stranded assets is a term for assets which turn out to be worth less than expected as a result of changes linked to the transition to a low-carbon economy.216 The FCA’s Handbook identifies prudential risks as “those that can reduce the adequacy of its financial resources, and as a result may adversely affect confidence in the financial system or prejudice consumers”. It offers examples of key prudential risks: credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, insurance risk and group risk.217 156. In March 2020, the Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, told us that the market was not accurately ‘pricing in’ climate risks.218 The significance of this point is that the potential financial consequences of climate-related risks could create a systemic risk with implications for financial stability. The Bank of International Settlements (BIS) describes these risks as comprising: •  physical risks which affect the value of financial assets;  •  transition risk which may result from the adjustment of asset prices towards a low-carbon economy; and  •  liability risks arising from increased compensation paid out as a result of climate change.219  157. Mark Carney, former Governor of the Bank of England, wrote to us in early 2020, noting that: If commitments to net-zero are realised, many carbon-related assets will not be viable. At one extreme, the IPCC 1.5 degree report finds that no more than 349 Gt220 of carbon can be emitted, assuming a target probability of 66% for limiting the rise in global temperatures to 1.5°C. In contrast, proven oil and gas reserves contain approximately 510 Gt of carbon, and coal reserves another 425 Gt221—meaning that the combustion of developed oil and gas reserves alone would exceed the budget for 1.5 degrees of warming. According to a frequently cited academic study,222 80% of the world’s known coal reserves, 30% of oil, and 50% of gas reserves are unburnable if emissions are to be consistent with keeping temperature rises below 2 degrees.223 158. Positive Money, a research and campaign organisation, submitted evidence which suggests that financial loss from the drop in value of fossil fuels is already underway.

It also drew our attention to projections by Mercer225 suggesting that the annual returns from coal could decline by an amount in a range from 18 per cent to 74 per cent over the next 35 years.226 Mark Carney also told us that market prices had begun to adjust, noting that “the transition away from coal has resulted in the combined market capitalisation of the top four US coal producers falling by over 99% since the end of 2010”227 and cited research228 which found that undeveloped reserves have a negative impact oil firms’ value. 159. Ms Sarah Breedon, Executive Director for UK Deposit Takers Supervision at the Bank of England, acknowledged that the mispricing of the market was a “potentially systemic risk” to the UK financial system. She told us that this was why the Bank of England was stress testing the largest banks and insurers, in order to get visibility of how the value of real and financial assets might change “in order to drive different decisions today, so that the transition we see is an early and orderly one”.229 160. Ms Breedon also told us that in order for the market to price climate risk correctly, two things were required: the market needed the right information and a better understanding of what might happen in terms of climate outcomes and climate policy. Ms Breedon considered that improved disclosure and scenario analysis would help resolve both of these issues.230 She also pointed out that the volatile experience of asset prices during the pandemic “will have made financial institutions much more sensitised to the possibility of these risks and these stranded assets”.231 161. However, while acknowledging the risk of stranded assets, some witnesses to the inquiry were unwilling to divest from fossil fuel assets, arguing that there is an appropriate investment strategy in oil and gas companies. Sandra Boss, representing BlackRock, told us that many of these oil and gas companies are: […] managing the transition very well. Those that are not managing it as well are increasingly finding their cost of capital goes up, so over time our clients’ assets are ever so gradually shifting towards the superior performers on sustainability.232 162. Similarly, Steve Waygood, Chief Responsible Investment Officer at Aviva Investors, argued that investors would have more influence over companies that needed to transition, such as BP, by remaining invested: “The divestment calls to action are not calls to action at all. We need to use our voice and our vote, […] to power that transition by correcting the market”.233 Mr Waygood further noted that investors would only cease to fund oil and gas once the Government had made it a bad investment by “doing the transition plans towards net zero effectively, soon, and internalising the cost of capital where it should belong.”234 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234  A think tank that carries out analysis of the impact of the energy transition on capital markets and the potential investment in high-cost, carbon-intensive fossil fuels.

Given these risks, some witnesses raised possible regulatory options around the capital regime, such as a “brown penalising factor” or a “green supporting factor”. Simon Howard, Chief Executive of the UK Sustainable Investment and Finance Association, told the previous Committee in 2019 that “my bank members are increasingly warm to the idea that a change is being made to the capital regime to make it easier to lend to green stuff and to steer money away from brown stuff, but they all say that we need data, we need understanding and we need to prove that it is long-term sustainable.”235 164. Dr Daniel Klier, Group Head of Sustainable Finance at HSBC, told us that “there is a very live discussion about anticipating the expected lower risk of green investments in some form of a green supporting factor. […] We all believe that green investments are lower risk. […]”.236 Dr Klier continued by saying that HSBC had analysed a very large population and found that outperformance versus the market was 10% over six months.237 165. Rather than supporting a brown penalising factor or a green supporting factor, Steve Waygood proposed a scaling factor that took into account the underlying asset’s alignment with the Paris Agreement, particularly the 1.5C scenario.238 166. Mark Carney, former Governor of the Bank of England, commented in his February 2020 letter that where there was evidence that green assets were less risky, this could be factored into the internal models used by banks to calculate capital requirements. He cited Bank of England analysis which had found mortgages against energy-efficient properties were 18% less likely to default.239 However, Mr Carney concluded that “absent explicit direction in its remit, the Bank would not advantage green lending in its risk-based supervision” as to do otherwise “would be to mix climate policy with prudential policy”. He also noted that the Bank of England was “examining the case for a brown-penalising factor that introduces additional capital charges on polluting and potentially risky activities”, but he observed that a lack of an accepted definition of ‘brown’, the possibility of activities transitioning from ‘brown’ to ‘green’, and the absence of data to measure the riskiness of an asset, remained impediments to implementing such a measure. Mr Carney added that the Bank of England was addressing the issue by contributing research to the Network on Greening the Financial System’s240 review of the quantification of risk differentials, and that the 2021 climate stress test would provide additional data.241 167. When we subsequently invited Sarah Breedon to comment on the option of a “brown penalising factor”, she suggested that the Bank needed to gain visibility of assets through its proposed climate stress test before it could consider the matter.242 The Economic Secretary to the Treasury told us that a “brown penalising factor” was not something he had considered specifically, and he suggested that what was needed, was to price in risk and have transparency around capital allocation. However, he added that all issues 235 236 237 238 239 240  241 242  Oral evidence taken on 8 October 2019 HC (2017–19) 2233, Q85, [Wes Streeting, Simon Howard] Q75 Q76 Q209 Guin and Korhonen, Does energy efficiency predict mortgage performance?, Bank of England Staff Working Paper No.852, (2020) Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) was established in December 2017 by eight central banks and supervisors, to strengthen the global response needed to meet the goals of the Paris agreement.

We have heard differing evidence on whether there should be amendments to the capital regimes to promote net zero. In light of its new remit letter, the Bank of England must now explain its thinking, as to what measures it might consider appropriate for the capital regime to better accommodate the climate risk associated with different investments. It should set out its views on the options for amending the capital regimes to reflect its new remit, taking into account the potential interaction with the other aims of prudential policy.  TCFD implementation and mainstreaming of green finance 169. In December 2015, the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system, announced the establishment of a Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).244 Mark Carney, then FSB Chair, outlined what the FSB hoped the taskforce would achieve, telling the COP21 Paris Climate Change Conference that: The FSB is asking the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures to make recommendations for consistent company disclosures that will help financial market participants understand their climate-related risks. Access to high quality financial information will allow market participants and policymakers to understand and better manage those risks, which are likely to grow with time.245 170. The TCFD published its recommendations in June 2017 on voluntary climate-related financial disclosures across four areas: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets, alongside 11 recommended disclosures.246 The TCFD also developed a tool to provide transparency around firms’ assets and carbon emissions, in order to allow businesses and investors to make sustainable investment choices more easily and to hold firms accountable. 171. In its July 2019 Green Finance Strategy, the Government set out its expectation that all listed companies and large asset holders disclose in line with TCFD recommendations by 2022, and it established a joint taskforce with UK regulators to explore the most effective way to approach disclosure and the appropriateness of mandatory reporting.247 172. We heard evidence which suggested that, in the absence of a mandatory approach, there was an appetite in the industry for a wider and faster roll-out of TCFD-aligned disclosures. Sandra Boss, representing BlackRock, acknowledged that the Financial Conduct Authority had consulted on TCFD disclosures from premium listed issuers but noted that: 243 244 245 246 247  Q327 FSB to establish Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, Financial Stability Board, press release, 4 December 2015 FSB to establish Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, Financial Stability Board, press release, 4 December 2015 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, Recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Final Report, (June 2017), p iv HM Treasury and Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, Green finance strategy; Transforming Finance for a Greener Future, July 2019, p 8  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  47  We think it could go faster. We would like it to ask for them in 2021. We would like to see it making this a requirement for all listed companies, not just the premium listed, and we want to make sure it is a requirement, not just a soft “comply and explain”.248 173. Similarly, Chris Cummings, Chief Executive Officer at the Investment Association, supported TCFD disclosures by listed companies and pointed out that the Investment Association had asked its members to insist that FTSE-listed investee companies report against TCFD; and he noted that “the majority of FTSE companies have now signed up to that.”249 Dr Daniel Klier, Group Head of Sustainable Finance at HSBC, agreed that twothirds of the FTSE 100 provides some level of TCFD disclosure, but he noted that the level of disclosure was very inconsistent, with only 4% of companies following the full TCFD guidelines.250 174. We also heard evidence that disclosures would form part of witnesses’ strategies for shareholder votes at company AGMs. Sandra Boss told us that BlackRock had asked companies to report using the TCFD framework: We identified 400 companies that we thought were the most carbonintensive in our portfolio. […] Immediately, in this voting season, we did two things. First, we took 61 votes. It was 55 companies. We said, “These companies are not yet doing as much as we think they should be doing”, and either we voted against directors or we voted in favour of shareholder proposals.”251 175. Steve Waygood supported shareholder votes on TCFD, and he proposed that in addition “the TCFD report itself should be an advisory vote on a standing basis at company AGMs”.252 He believed that if the TCFD report were to be buried within wider reporting requirements, its impact might be limited. 176. In November 2020, the UK’s Joint Government Regulator TCFD Taskforce published its interim report and roadmap setting out the Government’s intention to introduce mandatory climate-related financial disclosure requirements across the UK economy by 2025. The report concluded that “given the urgency of the climate threat, a voluntary approach to climate-related financial disclosure may not be sufficient”.253 177. The Taskforce roadmap sets out an indicative path illustrating how disclosures could cover seven categories of organisation over the next five years: listed commercial companies, UK-registered companies, banks and building societies, insurance companies, asset managers, life insurers and FCA-regulated pension schemes, and occupational schemes.254 The roadmap also noted that initial steps have been made to introduce TCFDaligned disclosures for certain listed companies, banks and building societies, insurance companies and occupational pension schemes.255 It also points out that the Financial Conduct Authority is proposing further measures for asset managers, life insurers, and 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255  Q234 Q68 Q68 Q222 Q235 HM Treasury, Interim Report UK Joint Government Regulator TCFD Taskforce, 9 November 2020, p 9, para 1.18 HM Treasury, Interim Report UK Joint Government Regulator TCFD Taskforce, 9 November 2020, p 11, para 2.2 HM Treasury, Interim Report UK Joint Government Regulator TCFD Taskforce, 9 November 2020, p 12, para 2.9  48  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  FCA-regulated pension schemes.256 178. Looking ahead, the Roadmap states that: In the coming years, UK Taskforce member organisations will take forward the strategies outlined in the Roadmap, subject to consultation and other statutory requirements. The UK Taskforce will continue to monitor the progress of the cross-sectoral implementation strategy to ensure that a coordinated approach is maintained. The Government will provide an update on progress in the 2022 refresh of the Green Finance Strategy.257 179. We took oral evidence from the Economic Secretary to the Treasury following the publication of the Roadmap. When we put it to him that the voluntary approach had not been working, he replied: We consulted considerably. We know there is a massive appetite. We made progress with large financial institutions. We are doing this in alignment with them but it is necessary to say that there is an expectation that we make progress here. There is staging around what a lot will do by 2023. It was a balance and there has not been significant dissent from this decision. It is seen as being in line with the direction in which we were moving, and others would criticise us for not doing this sooner. It is about getting that balance right.258 180. When the Economic Secretary was pressed on the differing timelines for implementation, he said: It is about the appropriateness of the rigidity of those timeframes, based on the size of businesses and sectors. […] but it is about saying what is accommodatable in different sectors in different timeframes. As I say, there is a conversation that has been going on to make sure that this is sustainable and achievable by a vast majority, and that is what has guided us.259 181. Steve Waygood, Chief Responsible Investment Officer at Aviva Investors, warned us that TCFD disclosure reporting might be insufficient: It does not require that we align our portfolios with net zero. We should require all financial institutions saying they support [the] Paris [accord] to do more than just the TCFD report. They need science-based targets, to set out what capital they will put towards financing the transition and to set out their engagement strategy.”260 Dr Emily Shuckburgh, Director of Cambridge Zero at Cambridge University argued that TCFD reporting could be expanded to include Scope 3 emissions—tracing emissions through supply chains—which would be “influential in moving TCFD from something that just the larger firms are focused on and broadening it throughout the economy, in an efficient way”.261 256 257 258 259 260 261  HM Treasury, Interim Report UK Joint Government Regulator TCFD Taskforce, 9 November 2020, p. 12 para 2.10 HM Treasury, A Roadmap towards mandatory climate-related disclosures, November 2020, p 9 , para 1.21 Q287 Q288 Q213 Q105  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  49  182. The Government has moved from a voluntary to a mandatory approach for ensuring that firms make climate-related financial disclosures. But the process will be run to different timetables for different firms, across different regulators according to the Roadmap published by the Joint Government Regulator TCFD Taskforce. The Treasury, via the Taskforce, will need to play a key role in ensuring that pressure is maintained for a consistent and rapid implementation of these disclosures. 183. We also draw the Treasury’s attention to evidence suggesting that the disclosure regime could be widened in scope, and that firms might usefully offer fuller disclosures.  Sustainable taxonomy 184. In November 2020, the Chancellor confirmed that the UK would implement a green taxonomy—a common framework for determining which activities can be defined as environmentally sustainable. The UK taxonomy would “take the scientific metrics in the EU taxonomy as its basis” and a UK Green Technical Advisory Group would be established “to review these metrics to ensure they are right for the UK market”.262 185. When asked on the timeline for the implementation of a green taxonomy, the Economic Secretary told us that: Regarding implementation of the green taxonomy, you will be aware that the government has made the necessary amendments to retained EU law to ensure that the UK has an effective framework for implementation of the taxonomy after the end of the EU exit transition period.263 As part of that legislation, the government is required to publish the technical screening criteria for climate change adaptation and mitigation by the end of 2021, and for the remaining four environmental objectives by 2023. The Government will be launching a Green Technical Advisory Group in 2021 to advise, on an ongoing basis, on improvements that could be made to the taxonomy to better facilitate the UK’s environmental goals.264 186. Several witnesses told us of the need for such a taxonomy. Huw Evans, Director General of the Association of British Insurers, told us that “we have to have a common language that we talk about when we talk about what options are available to customers”.265 Similarly, Sandra Boss, Global Head of Investment Stewardship at BlackRock, referencing the EU taxonomy, saw an opportunity for the UK to design its own solution and noted that a product taxonomy for ESG investing was very important.266 Sheldon Mills, Interim Executive Director of Strategy and Competition of the FCA, outlined the importance of a taxonomy when thinking about the implementation of the TCFD. He noted that: It is not sufficient for us just to have a rule that says, “Disclose against these 11 principles under TCFD.” … There is no common approach; there is no common taxonomy that underlies that and allows for comparability and 262 263 264 265 266  HM Treasury, “Chancellor sets out ambition for future of financial services”, accessed 18 February 2021 The Securities Financing Transactions, Securitisation and Miscellaneous Amendments (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/1385) HM Treasury, Letter from Economic Secretary relating to Decarbonisation and Green Finance, 16 December 2020, para. 18 Q188 Q191  50  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  so on. In terms of the EU sustainable work, even though we will not be applying that rule, because it will come into force after we have exited, we will naturally be working with Government as to how they think about the UK’s approach to taxonomy and those sorts of issues.267 187. Chris Cummings, Chief Executive Officer at the Investment Association, did though point to work which the Investment Association had done on a “responsible investment framework”. He explained that: The framework we have published goes beyond what we have seen in the European Union. It goes to the point I made about the UK’s pre-eminence and our desire to be recognised as world leaders and build on that position. Ultimately, it is about bringing consistency of language and approach, so that investors can have real confidence that the money they are investing is being put to good use, in the way they would expect, and we can report back on that.268 188. As noted above, the UK is not alone in developing such a taxonomy. An EU taxonomy for sustainable activities was developed269 and came into force on 12 July 2020, following the recommendation of the ‘Commission action plan on financing sustainable growth’. The EU taxonomy establishes six environmental objectives, and tasks the Commission with establishing the actual list of environmentally sustainable activities through delegated acts. So far, the first delegated act on sustainable finance is due to be adopted in April 2021, and the taxonomy for the remaining environmental objectives should be established by the end of 2021 and will apply by end 2022. The first company reports and investor disclosures using the EU taxonomy are due at the start of 2022, covering the financial year 2021.270 189. The Economic Secretary to the Treasury wrote to the House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee in June 2020, recognising that the EU taxonomy will play an “important role in the development of Green Finance and in preventing greenwashing, an important UK objective”; and he confirmed the Government’s commitment to “at least match the ambition of the objectives of the EU Sustainable Finance Action Plan”.271 190. Inconsistencies may arise if different jurisdictions develop their own taxonomies independently. Mr Sheldon Mills, Interim Executive Director of Strategy and Competition at the FCA, told us that the Financial Conduct Authority was working with IOSCO [International Organisation of Securities Commissions] ahead of COP 26 to create “some sort of international framework which would allow for some sort of common taxonomy across these disclosures”.272 Anthony Raymond, General Counsel and Director of Legal Services, Policy and Advisory Directorate at the Pensions Regulator, agreed that “international parity, the taxonomy and that level playing field will be really important in the future”.273  267 268 269 270 271 272 273  Q123 Q68 Commission Regulation (EU) No. 2020/852 European Commission, ‘Implementing and delegated acts’, accessed 19 February 2021 HM Treasury, EST letter to Sir William Cash MP, 28 May 2020 Q161 Q166  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  51  191. The Economic Secretary to the Treasury recognised the need for international consensus to avoid conflicting taxonomies, and he told us that in relation to the UK’s taxonomy and climate-related disclosures there was “a lot of discussion in different jurisdictions about exactly what the taxonomy should be, and we need to be very clear about that so that the regulators are in a position to enforce that.”274 The Economic Secretary recognised that the UK’s presidency of the G7 and COP 26 “gives us a real opportunity to set frameworks and work collaboratively to drive forward the clarity that we need”.275 192. A taxonomy is an important part of identifying what can be considered green investment, so the announcement of a UK taxonomy is welcome. The Treasury and regulators should work at speed to ensure that there is a clear timetable and legislative pathway to deliver a UK taxonomy ahead of COP26 in November 2021. The UK can utilise the EU’s taxonomy but can exceed it when it will assist the UK’s goals. The UK should seize the opportunity presented by COP26 to use its own work on a taxonomy to push for greater international convergence.  274 275  Q279 Q282  52  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  Conclusions and recommendations The economic opportunities and costs of net zero 1.  Although the Government has emphasised the need for a “green” recovery, we note it has not, except in limited circumstances, imposed green conditionality on the support it has provided during the coronavirus pandemic. Whilst it is clear that support schemes were required to be provided without delay the Treasury should set out why it did not include green conditionality for the Recovery Loan Scheme announced in the 2021 Budget. (Paragraph 23)  2.  The Government has made bold claims that the economic recovery will be a green recovery. In order to achieve that, the Government needs to set out in its Net Zero Strategy who, at ministerial level, will be responsible for delivering net zero, coordinating the roles of different departments, and ensuring that the UK remains on track to meet its net zero target in a cost-effective way. (Paragraph 30)  3.  In the Net Zero Review final report, the Government should set out what mechanisms it will put in place to integrate the net zero target within departments’ spending review commitments, and how departments will be held to account should they fail to meet their targets. (Paragraph 35)  4.  The Chancellor should publish the Net Zero Strategy as soon as possible and should set out, in conjunction with the Net Zero Review final report, the principles upon which the UK will fund its transition to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. (Paragraph 46)  5.  There are a number of different estimates of the cost of achieving net zero by 2050. However, the Government has not yet committed to its own cost estimates and should set these out as soon as possible. The Government should include in the Net Zero Review final report its own methodology on costs; and it should set out clearly where the uncertainties lie. The Treasury should also include a range of scenarios on how net zero might be achieved, and the associated cost for each scenario. (Paragraph 47)  6.  The Treasury’s Net Zero Review final report should include clear sectoral pathways towards decarbonisation and should address the key policy decisions as to the future of high carbon industries. Particular attention should be given to the potential regional impact of those decisions, and the Government should set out a framework and strategy for supporting those communities which will be most impacted by these changes. This is especially important given the Government’s commitment to a Just Transition as part of the Paris Agreement. (Paragraph 53) Green finance to support green decarbonisation  7.  The Government has recognised that private finance will need to play a key part in funding the transition to net zero. If it is to do so, the Government will need to provide long-term certainty in climate-related policy and must ensure that consistent policy signals are sent to investors. We are encouraged that the Government acknowledged these needs in the 2021 Budget. (Paragraph 59)  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  53  8.  We welcome the announcement in the 2021 Budget of a timetable for the issuance of the UK’s first green sovereign bond or ‘green gilt’. However, the UK is lagging behind other countries in the issuance of these green bonds. This runs the risk of holding back the development of a private sterling green bond market. Although concerns about the potential for green bonds to be a more expensive form of debt for the Government seem to have dissipated to a degree, the Government should none the less set out its tolerance, when issuing such bonds, for them to be more expensive than other forms of Government debt. (Paragraph 66)  9.  We note the new remit provided to the Monetary Policy Committee, which will allow it to rebalance its Corporate Bond Purchase Scheme to take account of the climate impact of the bonds it holds. We will continue to scrutinise this process and will examine how any changes are enacted, and how those changes impact on the other policy objectives and the independence of the Monetary Policy Committee. (Paragraph 74)  10.  We note the debate at the Productive Finance Working Group Steering Committee on retail access to the ‘long term asset fund’ (LTAF). There should be clarity about who will have access to the LTAF. The Chancellor and the financial regulators should set out the timeframe for the launch of the announced ‘long term asset fund’ to allow pension savers to invest in long-term projects. We would expect that such an LTAF would be focused on providing a net-zero compliant product. (Paragraph 80)  11.  The Treasury should, as part of its review of Solvency II, consider reforms that could improve the funding of sustainable green infrastructure while maintaining the financial stability of insurers. (Paragraph 84)  12.  In the proposed framework for the new UK Infrastructure Bank, the Chancellor should clarify its governance arrangements, how investment decisions will be made, and how it will ensure that it attracts sufficient private capital. In particular, it should clearly set out how the Bank will meet the Government’s commitment to Net Zero. The Government should also set out how it will incorporate lessons learned from the former Green Investment Bank, and whether it intends that the UK Infrastructure Bank should be funded to offer a lending facility at a level similar to that offered by the European Investment Bank before the UK referendum on membership of the EU. (Paragraph 95) The role of consumers  13.  There is a high level of inertia amongst consumers around defined contribution pension fund choice, with most remaining in the ‘default’ fund. The Treasury has been robust in its view that default funds should not be required to move to more green alternatives, but at the same time maintains that consumers should not have to switch out of the default fund to invest sustainably. The Government should resolve this apparent contradiction. At present the Treasury is relying on a blend of disclosure, regulation and public investment to foster a transition towards more sustainable investment. For now, we support that approach, but the Treasury should report regularly on the proportion of pension holders in defined contribution pension schemes who remain in the default fund, and the extent to which those default funds are aligned with a path to Net Zero. (Paragraph 108)  54  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  14.  Consumers who hold defined benefits pensions have no choice as to how their assets are allocated. They rely upon their trustees. We note that previous attempts to get defined benefit schemes to acknowledge Environmental Social and Governance concerns have not been entirely successful. In its phased approach to implementing the regulations, the Pensions Regulator will need to consider how to reach smaller pension schemes. The draft regulations appear to exclude the smallest trust schemes. However, when their effects are aggregated, they may still have an impact on meeting the net zero target. In responding to this Report, the Government should set out how these smaller funds will be encouraged to integrate climate governance and reporting requirements. (Paragraph 117)  15.  The financial services industry broadly accepts that ‘greenwashing’ is detrimental to good consumer outcomes and to the achievement of the net zero goal. The Treasury must work with the FCA to ensure that the regulator has the appropriate remit, powers and priorities, and uses its powers, to prevent ‘greenwashing’ of financial products available to consumers. (Paragraph 124)  16.  Financial products should be clearly labelled to allow consumers to assess the relative climate impacts of products and to make choices accordingly. However, allowing every firm to create its own consumer sustainability labels may lead to inconsistencies and consumer confusion. The Treasury and the Financial Conduct Authority should consult on the merits of making climate or carbon labels for consumer financial products mandatory, as a means to encourage innovation. The FCA should consult on how best to make such labels readily and widely understood. (Paragraph 130)  17.  We note the concerns expressed about indices, in that the most popular may be carbon-intensive, and those that purport to be green may have carbon-intensive constituents. The risk remains that many consumers are unaware of the carbonintensity of the indices that their passive investments are tracking. The Treasury and regulators should therefore ensure that all indices (whether conventional or climatefriendly) clearly set out the overall carbon footprint of the assets included within indices. (Paragraph 137)  18.  On the concerns around the constituents of indices described as ‘green’, we note the requirements under the Benchmarks Regulation, which should be used to help consumers make better choices. However, it is clear that in some cases the labels or descriptions of ‘green’ or ‘climate-related’ indices do not necessarily match legitimate consumer expectations of what they would commonly be understood to mean. The Treasury and FCA should review the provisions in the legislative and regulatory framework and ensure that the labels and descriptions of indices accurately reflect their content, in line with consumer expectations. (Paragraph 138)  19.  The Government’s Green Finance Strategy noted the need for innovation in green finance products and services, yet the evidence we have received suggests that the pace of innovation could be accelerated and that more could be done to encourage take-up. The Financial Conduct Authority should seriously consider undertaking further “green fintech challenges” to encourage innovation. The regulator should also set out how it will tackle remaining regulatory barriers which discourage innovative ‘green’ financial products from coming to market. The Government and the regulators  Net zero and the Future of Green Finance  55  should work more closely with the Green Finance Institute to bring innovative ideas which will benefit consumers to the market. (Paragraph 149) 20.  The Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority should move quickly to incorporate their revised remits to include climate change. We will continue to monitor their progress and ongoing approach to the risks arising from climate change. (Paragraph 154)  21.  We have heard differing evidence on whether there should be amendments to the capital regimes to promote net zero. In light of its new remit letter, the Bank of England must now explain its thinking, as to what measures it might consider appropriate for the capital regime to better accommodate the climate risk associated with different investments. It should set out its views on the options for amending the capital regimes to reflect its new remit, taking into account the potential interaction with the other aims of prudential policy. (Paragraph 168)  22.  The Government has moved from a voluntary to a mandatory approach for ensuring that firms make climate-related financial disclosures. But the process will be run to different timetables for different firms, across different regulators according to the Roadmap published by the Joint Government Regulator TCFD Taskforce. The Treasury, via the Taskforce, will need to play a key role in ensuring that pressure is maintained for a consistent and rapid implementation of these disclosures. (Paragraph 182)  23.  We also draw the Treasury’s attention to evidence suggesting that the disclosure regime could be widened in scope, and that firms might usefully offer fuller disclosures. (Paragraph 183)  24.  A taxonomy is an important part of identifying what can be considered green investment, so the announcement of a UK taxonomy is welcome. The Treasury and regulators should work at speed to ensure that there is a clear timetable and legislative pathway to deliver a UK taxonomy ahead of COP26 in November 2021. The UK can utilise the EU’s taxonomy but can exceed it when it will assist the UK’s goals. The UK should seize the opportunity presented by COP26 to use its own work on a taxonomy to push for greater international convergence.

This would keep the UK in line with the commitments it made as part of the 2016 Paris Agreement to keep global warming under 2 degrees. The CCC has also advised on devolved jurisdictions contribution to net zero: Scotland, Wales and more recently, NI. A number of nations have passed laws formally establishing net zero targets: Sweden and Scotland by 2045, and the UK (as a whole), France, Denmark, Hungary and New Zealand by 20501. Similar draft legislation has been proposed in other countries e.g. Spain2, and Canada in November 20203. Some countries have set targets, but are yet to pass these in law. For example, in 2016, Norway was among one of the first parliaments in the world to agree carbon neutrality (where climate reductions = emissions) by 2030 and 90-95% reductions by 2050. However, these targets have not been adopted by the government and not enshrined in law.4 Bhutan is one of the only countries in the world considered carbon negative. Having a low population (<1 million), over 70% tree cover and all power generated by hydropower means it absorbs more CO2 (about 7 million tonnes/year) than it emits (around 2 million tonnes/year). It also limits tourists and places environmental protection as key in its Gross National Happiness Index, which is at the centre of all its political decisions.5 NI in context Northern Ireland accounted for 4.3% of total UK greenhouse gas emissions in 2018 and produced the equivalent of 10.3 tonnes of CO2 per person compared with a UK figure of 6.8 tonnes of CO2 per person. The UK makes up approximately 1% of global emissions. Based on estimates- NI’s share of global emissions is around 0.04%6.  1  Ibid and Grantham Institute [online] Climate Change Laws of the World https://www.climate-laws.org/ And Institute for Government Explainers: Net Zero Target https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/net-zerotarget 3 Climate Home News {{accessed 24/02/2021] https://www.climatechangenews.com/2019/06/14/countries-net-zero-climategoal/ 4 Ibid and Climate Action Tracker [accessed 24/02/2021] Norway https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/norway/pledges-andtargets/ 5 GVI UK Why Bhutan is the only carbon-negative country in the world https://www.gvi.co.uk/blog/bhutan-carbon-negativecountry-world/ 6 Northern Ireland does not submit annual inventories to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), therefore there is no reference for global CO2 emissions based on national inventory reporting. However, DAERA provided this figure using data sourced from the World Resources Institute on total ‘world greenhouse gas emissions’ (provided by email correspondence to AERA Committee (18/08/2020) 2  Providing research and information services to the Northern Ireland Assembly  3  NIAR 47-21  Briefing Paper  1.1 What is net zero? Net zero refers to achieving a balance between the amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced and the amount removed from the atmosphere. There are two different routes to achieving net zero, which work in tandem: reducing existing emissions and actively removing greenhouse gases7. A gross-zero target would mean reducing all emissions to zero. According to the Institute for Government, this is not realistic, so instead the net-zero target recognises that there will be some emissions but that these need to be fully offset, for example through natural carbon sinks such as oceans and forests. Research is on-going into using artificial carbon sinks to remove carbon from the atmosphere8. When the amount of carbon emissions produced are cancelled out by the amount removed, the UK will be a net-zero emitter. The lower the emissions, the easier this becomes.9  2  Current targets/net zero targets  2.1 NI NI does not have specific climate change legislation, and it contributes to the UK target under the Climate Act 2008. However, climate change legislation is being considered for NI, based on advice from the CCC in relation to NI’s contribution to the UK net zero by 2050. As shown in Table 1, the latest advice from the CCC suggests an overall 82% reduction of all GHGs by 2050, with an interim of 48% by 2030. It has also suggested supplementary targets for CO2 (net zero by 2050) or all GHG excluding methane (up to 96% by 2050. That being said, advice from the CCC is not final, and exactly what targets will be included is the decision of the DAERA Minister.

In June 2019, secondary legislation was passed that extended that target to “at least 100%”. Current carbon budgets exclude emissions from international aviation and shipping (those produced by planes and ships while in UK territorial waters and airspace). However, advice from the CCC is that the Sixth Carbon Budget and final net zero target should account for such emissions.11 The Scottish Government has set itself a target of net zero by 2045 in line with recommendations by the CCC.12 It it has been considered as having more potential capacity to remove emissions from the atmosphere than the rest of the UK due to its abundant land, with potential for afforestation (planting trees to create forests, which are natural carbon sinks). 13 Wales currently has an 80% target by 2050 under the Wales Environment Act 2016. In 2019, Wales committed to setting a 95% reduction target in 2050. However the Welsh Government has committed to net zero by 2050 off the back of its latest advice from the CCC in relation to net zero by 205014. The RoI is legislating for net zero by the end of 2050 through its National 2050 Climate Objective under its Draft Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2020. And NZ has legislated for net zero by 2050, including a biogenic methane target, under its Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act 2019.  11  CCC (2020) Sixth Carbon Budget Report (p.15 and 19) https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/sixth-carbon-budget/ Scottish Government, Climate change, GOV.SCOT www.gov.scot/policies/climate-change/reducing-emissions 13 Committee on Climate Change, Net Zero: The UK’s contribution to stopping global warming, 2 May 2019, www.theccc.org.uk/publication/net-zero-the-uks-contribution-to-stopping-global-warmin 14 Welsh Government Wales commits to net zero by 2050, but sets out ambitions to get there sooner https://gov.wales/wales-commits-net-zero-2050-sets-out-ambitions-get-there-sooner 12  Providing research and information services to the Northern Ireland Assembly  5  NIAR 47-21  Briefing Paper  Table 2: Net zero targets  Legislation  Targets  UK (all 4 regions including NI)  NI  Scotland  Wales  RoI  NZ  Climate Change Act 2008 as (as amended by UK Climate Change Act 2008 (2050 Target Amendment) Order 2019)  UK Climate Change Act 2008  Climate Change Act 2009 (as amended by the Climate Change (Emissions Reduction Targets) Act 2019  Wales Environment Act 2016 to be amended by The Environment (Wales) Act 2016 (Amendment of 2050 Emissions Target) Regulations 2021  Draft Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2020  Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act 2019  Net zero target: 100% emissions reduction by 2050 compared to 1990 levels (this includes contribution from all 4 regions).

This was based on 2019 advice from the CCC which felt Wales would have a much more difficult path to reach net zero by 2050, in part because of its high agricultural emissions.27 However, this target was not written into law. Legislation is now being revised in light of the new advice from the CCC in December 2020 which states that Wales should now aim for net zero by 2050. This was not due to a sudden change in heart. Even when the 95% 2050 target was suggested, the Welsh Government stated it would continue to work with the CCC to identify how Wales might go beyond 95% in 2050.28 The latest CCC advice in December 2020 states that: When the Committee provided its 2019 advice, we demonstrated that any negative economic impact of achieving very deep emissions reductions in Wales was likely to be small and the overall impact could turn out to be positive. Our analysis of the full pathway to Net Zero in Wales for this report reinforces that finding.29 That being said, the CCC recognises this will not be without its challenges: But significant gaps remain. Despite good progress, Wales is not yet on track to meet its existing, less stringent, 80% emissions target. A cohesive, economy-wide strategy for 2050, that ties in with UK-wide plans, is urgently needed if Wales is to reach Net Zero by that date30. However, the impact of net zero on Welsh agriculture was one of the main reasons for advising the 95% target in 2019. In its latest advice, the CCC has stated that one of the key actions to reaching net zero is with the transformation of more farmland to woodland, which could bring revenue opportunities to farmers: “With the right policies this can be a new source of revenue to Welsh farmers.” It also details how recent policy developments may aid the transition to net zero.

That compares to total low-carbon investment in the UK of around £50 billion. The increase is deliverable, primarily by private companies and individuals, alongside other investment, provided effective policy is put in place.32 However, it is of the opinion that most of this can be recouped and paid for at the UK level: Much of the investment spending can be recouped through lower operating costs. These savings, many of which relate to reduced reliance on imported fossil fuels, will rise to around £800 million by 2030 and £2.5 billion by 2050. Our estimate of annualised resource costs is less than £2 billion per year in Wales for the entirety of the period 2020 to 2050. That is lower than our 2019 estimate for the cost of reaching Net Zero emissions (we previously 31 32  P.34 CCC advice https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/the-path-to-net-zero-and-progress-reducing-emissions-in-wales/ P.99 ibid  Providing research and information services to the Northern Ireland Assembly  10  NIAR 47-21  Briefing Paper  estimated costs to be around £3-5 billion by 2050). Many of the costs of reducing emissions in Wales will likely be paid for at UK level and/or socialised across the whole of the UK.33  It is not quite clear from the advice what is meant by “the right/effective policies” and exactly what costs are expected to be incurred by individuals in transitioning to more carbon neutral farming practices. Particularly whether this would offset any potential rewards earned under ‘Sustainable Farming’ policy. Costs for Wales may not be directly comparable to NI, based on the differences in farming practice. What the CCC is suggesting is a major change in farming practices in Wales in order to reach net zero. This change may be even more considerable and costly for NI given that the majority of farms are pasture/livestock compared to Wales’ more arable-based system.  2.4 Considerations  Is the suggested target for NI presented in a similar manner to that of Wales, with the idea of considering working towards a net zero target by 2050?   NZ legislates for GHG net zero by 2050 and a biogenic methane target of 2447% below 2017 levels, and 10% by 2030 under the Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Act 2019.   The CCC has suggested supplementary GHG targets excluding methane. Is this due to potential impacts on agriculture and production?   The RoI sets sector specific carbon budgets (decarbonisation target ranges); is this something that could be considered for NI to give a more statutory joined up/holistic approach to addressing climate change across sectors?  33  ibid  Providing research and information services to the Northern Ireland Assembly  11  NIAR 47-21  3  Briefing Paper  Sources of emissions The following section explores the main sources of emissions in NI. Sources of emissions are reported in NI’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory (see Box 1)  Box 1: Greenhouse Gas Inventory The UK ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in December 1993, and the Convention came into force in March 1994. Parties to the Convention are committed to develop, publish, and regularly update national emission inventories of greenhouse gases (GHGs). In line with this, GHGs in NI are recorded by DAERA and reported in the Greenhouse Gas Inventories. These feed into the United Kingdom’s National Inventory Report (NIR). The latest figures are for 1990-2018, and these form the UK’s 2020 submission to the UNFCCC. They also form the UK’s submission under the Kyoto Protocol. The latest GHG Inventory for NI (1990-2018) reports that:   The UK makes up approximately 1% of global emissions. Based on estimatesNI’s share of global emissions is 0.04%1.    Northern Ireland accounted for 4.3% of total UK greenhouse gas emissions in 2018 and produced the equivalent of 10.3 tonnes of CO2 per person compared with a UK figure of 6.8 tonnes of CO2 per person.    In total, the UK reduced emissions by 43% between the base year and 2018. England and Scotland reduced emissions by 46% and 45% respectively. Wales and Northern Ireland reduced emissions by 31% and 20% respectively.    In 2018, Northern Ireland’s greenhouse gas emissions were estimated to be 19.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. This was a decrease of 2% compared with 2017, and a decrease of 20% compared to the base year (1990).    Carbon dioxide accounted for 68% of all greenhouse gas emissions in Northern Ireland (13.1 MtCO2e) in 2018.  Providing research and information services to the Northern Ireland Assembly  12  NIAR 47-21  Briefing Paper  3.1 Sources of emissions NI The largest sectors in terms of emissions in 2018 were agriculture (27%), transport (23%) and energy supply (15%), as shown in Figure 1.  Figure 1: Greenhouse gas emissions by sector, 2018  Source: DAERA34  Ammonia There is growing concern about the impact of ammonia emissions from livestock on habitats. According to the Sustainable Agricultural Land Management Strategy for NI, “the majority of NI protected habitats have been reported as being damaged or under threat of damage from nitrogen deposition”.35 Ammonia emissions are measured across the UK by the UK National Ammonia Monitoring Network (NAMN).36 NI is the only part of the UK in which ammonia emissions are not continuing to decline. 37 There is a Code of Good Agricultural Practice in place for reducing ammonia emissions, by  34  DAERA (2020) Northern Ireland Greenhouse gas statistics 1990-2018 statistical bulletin (p.7).

However, the Sustainable Agricultural Land Management Strategy suggests that assessments of new agricultural developments may need to be intensified to keep in line with the EU’s 2030 ceiling for the UK equating to 16% reduction in ammonia emissions (since 2005).39 Further information on the impacts of ammonia on the environment can be found in Code of Good Agricultural Practice for the Reduction of Ammonia Emissions, CAFRE  3.1.1 Trends Figure 3: % change in emissions per sector  Source: DAERA40 Most sectors showed a decreasing trend since the base year. The largest decreases, in terms of tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, were in the energy supply, waste management and residential sectors (figure 3). According to DAERA, these were driven by improvements in energy efficiency, fuel switching from coal to natural gas, which became available in the late 1990s, and the introduction of methane capture and oxidation systems in landfill management41. However, agriculture showed a 1% increase since 1990 and transport a staggering 29% increase. DAERA attributes these increases due to growth in demand for transport, despite improvements in efficiency of vehicles and increased emissions from cattle due to increased livestock numbers42.  38  Code of Good Agricultural Practice for the Reduction of Ammonia Emissions, CAFRE DEFRA Emissions of air pollutants in the UK, 1970 to 2019 – Ammonia (NH3) https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/emissions-of-air-pollutants/emissions-of-air-pollutants-in-the-uk-1970-to-2018ammonia-nh3 40 DAERA (2020) Northern Ireland Greenhouse gas statistics 1990-2018 statistical bulletin (p.7).

While its net contributions are relatively small, trends have shown a marked increase (see Box 2) Box 2: Land-use Change Sector Northern Ireland is the only UK region where the land-use change sector acts as a net emitter of greenhouse gas emissions. England, Scotland and Wales are all classified as ‘sinks’ that absorbs carbon.  In NI, while the land-use change sector makes a relatively small net contribution to emissions (2.6%), contributions have increased by 32.5% since 1990. According to the 2019 UK greenhouse gas emissions: final figures - statistical release (p.8), this mainly reflects the changes in carbon stock associated with land conversions between cropland, grassland, settlements and forest land. The largest growth in emissions since 1990 is from grassland converted to settlements and cropland converted to grassland in Northern Ireland.  3.2 Comparison with the rest of the UK According to Figure 2:   Transport makes the biggest contribution to overall UK emissions at 21%. This compares to Wales at 14% and NI at 16%. However, the CCC does not attribute these lower figures to a more carbon-efficient surface transport sector. Other sources of emissions, such as agriculture in NI, increase the total national emissions that transport emissions are compared to. This makes the share of transport emissions of the total smaller. Per person, surface transport emissions are actually higher in Northern Ireland than the UK average.   Agriculture makes the largest contribution to emissions in NI with 27%, this is also the largest compared to the rest of the UK at 10%, and Scotland and Wales both at 16%. High levels are attributed to high numbers in livestock and pastureland compared to the rest of the UK.   Manufacturing and construction makes the largest contribution to emissions in Wales at over 20% compared to the rest of the UK at around 10% and under.   Transport, followed closely by agriculture, makes the biggest contribution to emissions in Scotland.   NI has relatively low emissions from manufacturing, aviation and fuel supply compared to the rest of the UK.

This is followed by:   energy supply (generating electricity from burning fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas) with 21%;   business (commercial use of electricity) with 17%;  residential sector (heating homes) with 15%;  agriculture with 10%;  The other 10% was attributable to the remaining sectors: waste management, industrial processes, the public sector and the land use, land use change and 43  CCC (December 2020) Letter: Lord Deben, Climate Change Committee to Edwin Poots MLA https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/letter-lord-deben-climate-change-committee-to-edwin-poots-mla/ 44 2019 UK greenhouse gas emissions: final figures - statistical release  Providing research and information services to the Northern Ireland Assembly  16  NIAR 47-21  Briefing Paper  forestry (LULUCF) sector which includes both sinks and sources of emissions (see Box 2).  3.3 Comparison with RoI The emissions profile in NI is similar to the Republic of Ireland, with agriculture having the largest contribution to GHGs. In fact, RoI’s proportion of GHGs from agriculture is said to be the largest in Europe, yet its food products (milk and beef) have one of the lowest carbon footprints (emissions per unit of output or “carbon intensity”) internationally. 45 One of the aims of the Irish Agriculture and Food Development Authority is carbon neutral farming by 2050. This means agriculture would need to lock away as much GHGs as it emits, resulting in zero net emissions.46  4  Programmes The following section considers some of the main programmes that aim to address climate change across NI. All departments and sectors bear a collective responsibility to address climate change. The following provides a breakdown of responsibility across NI departments. Please note this provides a summery and should not be taken as a complete account of all department responsibilities. In summary47:   DAERA takes the lead in terms of climate adaptation, mitigation, monitoring and reporting. It bears the responsibility for ensuring our natural environment and farming practices can be resilient to climate change. This is through protecting our biodiversity and habitats, while encouraging sustainable land management and food production practices from our agriculture sector.   Department for Infrastructure (DfI) has responsibility for addressing climate change through our planning system, transport and infrastructure, water provision and mitigation against flooding.   Department for the Economy (DfE) has strategic responsibility for tourism, energy and business support. It bears responsibility for climate change through promoting  45  http://www.bordbia.ie/industry/events/SpeakerPresentations/2014/MeatMarketProspectsSeminar2014/Efficient%20Farming%2 0-%20Dr.%20Roger%20Schulte,%20Teagasc.pdf in A Sustainable Agricultural Land Management Strategy for NI (p.27) https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/publications/sustainable-agricultural-land-management-strategy-report-and-executivesummary 46 Can Irish Agriculture be Carbon-Neutral by 2050? https://www.teagasc.ie/news--events/news/2013/can-irish-agriculturebecarbon-neutral-by-2050.php in A Sustainable Agricultural Land Management Strategy for NI (p.27) https://www.daerani.gov.uk/publications/sustainable-agricultural-land-management-strategy-report-and-executive-summary 47 Information used from NI climate Change Adaptation Plan Chapter 6 https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/publications/northernireland-climate-change-adaptation-programme-2019-2024  Providing research and information services to the Northern Ireland Assembly  17  NIAR 47-21  Briefing Paper  the efficient use of energy by the voluntary and community sector and local businesses.48   Department of Finance (DoF) produces building regulations in NI, which include energy efficiency, ventilation, moisture standards etc. all with the aim of burning less fossil fuels and adapting to climate change. It has responsibility for promoting efficient use of energy by public bodies.49   Department for Communities (DfC) has strategic responsibility for equality and poverty issues, including fuel poverty, the historic environment, housing and the community and voluntary sectors. DfC contributes to addressing climate change through its responsibility for promoting efficient use of energy in the domestic and housing sector.50   Department of Health (DoH) concerns itself with providing a health care system that can respond to the impact of climate change, both in terms of the direct impacts on health (extreme weather and over/under heating, air quality etc.) and impact on the delivery of the service (due to extreme weather events). It is clear from NI’s GHG emission sources that multiple sectors contribute to climate change both directly or indirectly. Delivering emissions reductions requires action across the power, buildings and industry, transport, agriculture and land use, and waste sectors, and can only be achieved through close co-ordination between the UK Government, Executive, and multiple government departments in NI.  4.1 Holistic approach The table in Appendix 1 (p.30) provides examples of departmental programmes aimed at addressing climate change across different sectors in NI. The table does not attempt to explicitly provide all programmes/initiatives/strategies that relate to addressing climate change directly or indirectly. That being said, it demonstrates the multitude of programmes across NI government departments in a rather fragmented way. While there is a cross departmental duty under the UK Climate Change Act 2008 for all departments to prepare a collective Adaptation Plan (Appendix 1 p.32), through identified risks, there appears to be a lack of a joined up strategic approach for working towards the most up to date aims, objectives, targets and mitigation measures. Some programmes are very much out of date, and are not suitable for reaching more recent ambitious targets. Some appear to be more focused on a reactionary response to climate change, rather than mitigation. We are at a time of significant policy transition, with many strategies and programmes coming to the end of their term and Brexit and COVID re writing some of our priorities. Therefore, it could be argued that it is essential to have a more joined up approach so that all departments and sectors are 48  Energy Management Strategy and Action Plan to 2030 (p.30) https://energysavingtrust.org.uk/programme/nisep/ ibid 50 Energy Management Strategy and Action Plan to 2030 (p.30) https://energysavingtrust.org.uk/programme/nisep/ and NI Climate Change Adaptation Strategy p.51 https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/publications/northern-ireland-climate-changeadaptation-programme-2019-2024 49  Providing research and information services to the Northern Ireland Assembly  18  NIAR 47-21  Briefing Paper  working towards a common goal so they know where they stand, exactly what is expected of them and when it is required.  4.2 Considerations:  Under the Climate Change Act 2008, there is a voluntary approach to adaptation reporting by public authorities. In comparison to Scotland, which has a legal duty for mitigation and adaptation reporting by public authorities in the Scotland Climate Change Act 2009. As mentioned in section 2.4, the ROI provides for sector specific carbon budgets (decarbonisation budgets).   What priorities will a NI Climate Act give to a more joined up and holistic response across NI Departments and sectors to climate change adaption and mitigation?  The Green Growth Strategy (as detailed in Appendix 1 p.33):   Is this considered the main holistic approach to addressing climate change across departments and sectors in NI?   Will there be more detail on the Strategy and when is it likely to be published?  Will it shape a Climate Change Act, or be shaped by a Climate Change Act, and NI’s contribution to net zero?  Updates of programmes to reflect most recent climate change targets and suggested net zero contribution:   Will there need to be an update to current strategies/ plans?  For example the Going for Growth Strategy (2013). Last published progress update was 2016. Are there plans for a new updated Strategy?   If so, what will the aim of the successor be, will the focus be sustainable growth in line with contributing to more ambitious climate change targets?  Until recent 2020 projections by DAERA, NI was expected to miss its 2030 targets of a 35% reduction on 1990 levels. However, DAERA have estimated that emissions reductions will reach 37% by 2030.51 That being said, if NI is to reach the more ambitious target of 82% by 2050 and an interim target of 48% by 2030, there are a number of policy gaps across sectors that need addressed in a holistic manner. Some of the following more specific gaps have 51  DAERA (2020) Northern Ireland Greenhouse Gas Projections based on 2017 GHG inventory https://www.daerani.gov.uk/news/northern-ireland-greenhouse-gas-projection-statistics-released  Providing research and information services to the Northern Ireland Assembly  19  NIAR 47-21  Briefing Paper  been identified by the CCC in its 2019 Reducing emissions in Northern Ireland in the following areas:   Developing a route to market for low-cost intermittent renewables, in particular onshore wind;   replace the common agricultural plan payments with payments that are linked to agricultural emissions reductions and sequestration;   increase the rate of tree planting;  introduce a policy to incentivise homeowners to install low-carbon heaters, replace oil boilers with heat pumps;   develop policy for delivering energy efficient improvements in homes targeted at low income households; and   assist in more rapid deployment of electric vehicles.  Members may want to explore further detail on these with the CCC.  5  Technology When trying to cut emissions, approaches can be taken to reduce existing emissions, through the replacement of carbon intense practices and technologies with low carbon alternatives and an increase in the use of renewable energy. Approaches can also be taken to actively remove or store emissions that have been produced. The CCC states that the focus for the UK during the 2020s should be as follows: The UK must build supply chains and new markets for low-carbon consumer offerings (e.g. electric cars and heat pumps) so that these can scale from being niche offerings to dominate the market and fully push out high-carbon alternatives by 2030 or soon after. Alongside, we must develop and scale up new options for industrial decarbonisation such as carbon capture and storage (CCS), low-carbon hydrogen and engineered emissions removals. Tree planting rates must increase from 13,000 hectares per year today to 30,000 hectares per year by 2025 in line with the Government’s commitment and continue to grow to 50,000 hectares per year by 2035.52  In its Advice Letter on NI’s net zero contribution, the CCC suggested a number of approaches that include both reduction and removal. At the request of the AERA Committee, the following section explores examples of “Greenhouse Gas removal  52  CCC ( December 2020) Policies’ for the Sixth Carbon Budget and Net Zero https://www.theccc.org.uk/wpcontent/uploads/2020/12/Policies-for-the-Sixth-Carbon-Budget-and-Net-Zero.pdf  Providing research and information services to the Northern Ireland Assembly  20  NIAR 47-21  Briefing Paper  technologies” as referred to in both the CCC letter and DAERA response on the NI contribution to UK Net Zero. Firstly, by way of context, the next section gives a brief description of renewable energy use and sources currently used in NI. This information is provided through a combination of Department for the Economy Statistics Reports and previous RaISe papers produced for the Economy Committee.  5.1 Renewable energy use in NI Renewable energy use, monitoring and reporting falls under the remit of DfE. However, the following section gives a brief summary of NI’s status in terms of renewable energy use and the main sources. 5.1.1 Current use and targets Between 2010 and 2020, renewable energy development in Northern Ireland (NI) has been largely steered by two targets:   Achieving 40% electricity consumption from renewable generation by 2020; and,  Achieving 10% heat consumption from renewable generation by 2020. Both targets were part of the Strategic Energy Framework 2010 to 2020. The DfE is about to launch a new Energy Strategy, which will set the framework for renewable development in NI potentially up to 2050. The 40% target for renewable electricity was achieved ahead of schedule, and has been surpassed. The latest figure is 47.7% (October 2019 - to September 2020). NI has shown a marked increase in electricity generated from renewable energy sources, from below 10% in 2010 to 47.7% in 202053. While NI has had success in terms of renewable electricity generation, the renewable heat target was missed. According to RaISe paper Renewable energy: background scoping paper (2020), similar figures and comparisons on renewable heating sources and load are not available due to not being measured. However, DfE estimates that NI is reliant on oil and gas for much of its heating.  53  DfE Electricity Consumption and renewable generation October 2019 to September 2020 (Issue 17) https://www.economyni.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/economy/Issue-17-electricity-consumption-and-renewable-generation-northernireland-october-2019-to-september-2020.pdf  Providing research and information services to the Northern Ireland Assembly  21  NIAR 47-21  5.1.2  Briefing Paper  Sources of renewable energy Figure 3: Renewable Electricity Generation by Type of Generation (October 2019 to September 2020)  Source: DfE Issue 17 (Dec 2020)54 Figure 3 illustrates that in 2020 the sources of renewable energy were as follows: Wind the highest with 84.5%, Biogas with 5.5%, Biomass with 4.2%, solar with 3.6%, landfill gas 1.5% and other (hydro, CHP) 0.6%. Whilst wind (particularly onshore) appears to be the dominant source, the latest DfE Statistical Report (Issue 17) states that the other non- wind sources have seen an increase in more recent years. However, offshore wind has not been developed55. Microgeneration (with capacity 50Kw or less) and non-export generating stations (stations that are unable to export electricity to the grid) are not covered by the DfE Statistical Reports, due to lack of available data. However, estimates provided by Ofgem from the Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) register suggest these make up 3.8% of the renewable generation volume56.  54  https://www.economy-ni.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/economy/Issue-17-electricity-consumption-and-renewablegeneration-northern-ireland-october-2019-to-september-2020.pdf 55 RaISe (2020) Renewable energy: background scoping paper 56 DfE (Issue 17) p.7 https://www.economy-ni.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/economy/Issue-17-electricity-consumptionand-renewable-generation-northern-ireland-october-2019-to-september-2020.pdf  Providing research and information services to the Northern Ireland Assembly  22  NIAR 47-21  Briefing Paper  The latest statistics also detail that 46.1% of electricity consumption was generated by local sourced renewable energy, showing a slight increase on the previous report. How is NI doing? As shown in Figure 4, Scotland has the highest renewable share of electricity generation with 61.1% (up 6 percentage points on 2018)). NI is next with shares of 44.6% (up 2.4pp), 33% in England (up 3.4pp) and 26.9% in Wales (up 4.1pp).  Figure 4: Renewable share of electricity generation by country, 2005 to 2019  Source: DBEIS (Dec 2020)57  5.2 Greenhouse Gas Removal Technologies In a letter to the AERA Committee (February 2020), DAERA provided information in response to the CCC’s Letter on NI’s net zero contribution. The letter made reference to “greenhouse gas removal technologies” in the following way: Whilst it is essential to reduce the level of emissions released into our environment we also have the opportunity to implement measures to use new technologies that remove and store our greenhouse gases. However it is important that these technologies are effective and cost efficient. We are aiming towards an all UK net zero target and Northern Ireland will have to make a significant contribution for this to be achieved. For Northern Ireland to achieve net zero it would lead to requiring a much greater than equal share of greenhouse gas removal technologies being located in Northern Ireland. Locating such technologies in Northern Ireland would be sub-  57  DBEIS (Dec 2020) https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/energy-trends-december-2020-special-feature-article-electricitygeneration-and-supply-in-scotland-wales-northern-ireland-and-england-2016-to-20  Providing research and information services to the Northern Ireland Assembly  23  NIAR 47-21  Briefing Paper  optimal and unlikely to be cost effective and ultimately could be detrimental in achieving the UK net zero target. 5.2.1 Carbon Capture and Storage According to the CCC Letter58, greenhouse gas removals technologies include carbon capture and storage (CCS) such as bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) and direct air CO2 capture with storage (DACCS) (see information Box 3): Box 3 What is CCS? According to the International Energy Agency and HoC Library: Carbon capture and storage (CCS) refers to the process by which carbon dioxide (CO2), that would have been released into the atmosphere from industrial waste gases, is captured, compressed into a liquid state, transported via pipeline, ship or road, and pumped into a geological storage site (e.g. depleted oil and gas fields or deep saline aquifer).  According to the London School of Economics and the Grantham Institute (2018), it can capture upwards of 90% of CO2 released through, for example, the burning of fossil fuels or industrial cement production. BECCS Bioenergy and carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is the process by which CO2 is absorbed via photosynthesis into organic matter such as plants or food waste (biomass). The biomass is then either burnt or converted to generate energy (bioenergy), with the resulting CO 2 being captured and stored. There are concerns around the sustainability and true carbon neutrality of BECCS (e.g. land use conflicts, often spans multiple geographical regions). See: BECCS deployment: a reality check (2018).  The UK Energy Research Centre suggests that further research is needed in relation to costs with estimates ranging from £12/tCO2 and as high as £314/tCO2 DACCS Direct Air carbon capture and storage (DACCS) is described by Nature Communications (2019) as the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere using a solid, liquid or gas sorbent. At an early stage of development, in comparison to BECCS. It is referred to as a complementary technology as it can capture CO 2 by distributed sources (e.g. aviation) and can be deployed in a modular manner, requiring less land than other technologies.  According to the UK Energy Research Centre, issues surround the feasibility of DACCS due to the dilute nature of ambient CO2, leading to energy-intensive extraction and large volumes of air to produce pure CO2. This makes it difficult to quantify costs and mitgation potential. Also, further investigation is needed into the environmental impacts. See: Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, and direct air carbon capture and storage (April 2019).  58  CCC (December 2020) Letter: Lord Deben, Climate Change Committee to Edwin Poots MLA https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/letter-lord-deben-climate-change-committee-to-edwin-poots-mla/  Providing research and information services to the Northern Ireland Assembly  24  NIAR 47-21  Briefing Paper  5.2.2 CCS role in combating climate change The CCC considers CCS playing an integral role in the UK’s transitions to Net Zero59 as it has the ability to reduce emissions across numerous sectors (e.g. manufacturing and construction, waste, transport and energy). There are 21 operational facilities globally60 but currently there are no operational CCS sites in the UK. This is principally due to substantial infrastructure costs and lack of commercial viability61, however the UK Government aims to deploy CCS at scale during the 2030s if there are substantial cost reductions62. The 2020 Budget announced an £800 million CCS Infrastructure Fund to establish at least two UK CCS sites, one by mid-2020s and a second by 2030, as part of the efforts to ‘growing a greener economy’. 63 In its Fifth Carbon Budget Report Cost Effective, the CCC states that its own estimates64 and those by the Energy Technologies Institute (ETI)65 indicate that the costs of meeting the UK’s 2050 target (80% at the time of writing) could almost double without CCS. At the global level, the IPCC has estimated that its absence could increase costs by over 100%66. 5.2.3 CCS in NI The CCC has explained that NI is not well suited for CCS due to the lack of CO2 storage sites. Which in turn requires captured CO2 to be transported to a storage site, incurring additional costs. Figure 5 shows possible locations for CO2 storage, none of which currently includes NI or Wales. The CCC explains that Wales and NI are less well suited for CCS than England and Scotland for the following reasons:   If CCS is used in places that are not located near to CO2 storage sites, the CO2 that is captured must be used or transported to a storage site. This will incur higher costs (e.g. the additional costs of shipping CO2 at around £10-20/tCO2) and may make other solutions that do not require CCS such as electrification more cost competitive. 59  CCC (December 2020) Letter: Lord Deben, Climate Change Committee to Edwin Poots MLA https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/letter-lord-deben-climate-change-committee-to-edwin-poots-mla/ 60 International Energy Agency https://www.iea.org/fuels-and-technologies/carbon-capture-utilisation-and-storage 61 Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy 2018 Clean Growth Strategy https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/700496/clean-growthstrategy-correction-april-2018.pdf 62 Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy The UK Carbon Capture Usage and Storage deployment pathway: an action plan https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/759637/beis-ccusaction-plan.pdf 63 HM Treasury 2020 Budget https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/budget-2020-documents 64 CCC (2012) The 2050 target – achieving an 80% reduction including emissions from international aviation and shipping https://www.theccc.org.uk/archive/aws/IA&S/CCC_IAS_TechRep_2050Target_April2012.pdf 65 ETI (2015) Building the UK carbon capture and storage sector by 2030 – Scenarios and actions http://www.eti.co.uk/wpcontent/uploads/2015/03/CCS-Building-the-UK-carboncapture-and-storage-sector-by-2013.pdf 66 138%, IPCC (2014) Fifth Assessment Report – Synthesis Report.

It is important to note that the UK Government holds reserved powers regarding CCS, but planning and environmental permits are devolved69. However, earlier research from 2009 on the assessment of the potential for geological storage of carbon dioxide in Ireland and Northern Ireland, suggests that there are four potential CO2 storage sites in Northern Ireland70;  67  Committee on Climate Change, Reducing emissions in Northern Ireland, February 2019 https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/reducing-emissions-in-northern-ireland/ 68 Committee on Climate Change, Net Zero - The UK's contribution to stopping global warming, May 2019 https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/net-zero-the-uks-contribution-to-stopping-global-warming/ 69 CCC (December 2020) Letter: Lord Deben, Climate Change Committee to Edwin Poots MLA https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/letter-lord-deben-climate-change-committee-to-edwin-poots-mla/ 70 Energy Procedia, Lewis et al., Assessment of the potential for geological storage of carbon dioxide in Ireland and Northern Ireland, February 2009.

However, the study noted there are potential major risks associated with developing the Portpatrick/Larne basin due to the lack of geological suitability and potential mixing of injected CO2 into the water supplies72. Clearly further investigation needs to be given to the potential of NI as location in line with the more recent problems highlighted by the CCC. Members may want to explore further with the CCC why NI has little potential for CO2 storage compared to parts of the UK? What plans and budget is needed to improve NI as a location for such technology, especially in light of the CCC’s 2019 report recommendation for NI to be ready to deploy CCS in 2030? 5.2.3 Carbon sequestration Other areas of focus suggested by the CCC in agriculture and land use include reducing the emissions given off by using low carbon farming practices and carbon sequestration (Box 4) through afforestation, peatland restoration to try and remove emissions from the atmosphere and store them in soils and the landscape: Low-carbon farming practices, afforestation, agroforestry and peatland restoration all have a crucial role to play in reducing emissions by 2050. The framework to follow the Common Agricultural Policy in each devolved administration provides an opportunity for more closely linked financial support to agricultural emissions reduction and increased carbon sequestration.73  71  Energy Procedia, Lewis et al., Assessment of the potential for geological storage of carbon dioxide in Ireland and Northern Ireland, February 2009 72 Energy Procedia, Lewis et al., Assessment of the potential for geological storage of carbon dioxide in Ireland and Northern Ireland, February 2009 73 CCC (December 2020) Letter: Lord Deben, Climate Change Committee to Edwin Poots MLA https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/letter-lord-deben-climate-change-committee-to-edwin-poots-mla/ p.41  Providing research and information services to the Northern Ireland Assembly  27  NIAR 47-21  Briefing Paper  Box 4 Carbon sinks and Carbon sequestration The Sustainable Agricultural and Land Management Strategy describes carbon sequestration as the potential to store carbon within agricultural soils and farmed landscapes (carbon sinks). Woodland performs an important role as a carbon sink in locking carbon in its woody biomass and within the soil. Soils may store many times more carbon than above the ground vegetation. Peat soils are particularly important and cover around 24.6% on NI. However, many in NI have been drained and dried out leading to oxidation of carbon and a reduced ability to sequester more. Grasslands can also act as major carbon sinks depending on soil type and management. However, over management can greatly reduce grassland ability. A study mentioned in the Strategy suggests that grassland carbon sinks have the potential of “offsetting up to 30% of GHG emission from many grassbased ruminant production systems.” However further research is needed in this area to fully appreciate grassland’s potential and contribution to offsetting emissions.  5.3 Considerations When considering appropriate technologies and approaches for NI to contribute to the UK net zero target, it’s important to understand the unique circumstances in NI, as these may ultimately determine what is appropriate for NI and what is not. Some of these unique circumstances have been highlighted by the CCC:   Ability to decarbonize the main emitting sector: Nearly 30% of all greenhouse gas emissions in Northern Ireland are from agriculture, compared to 10% in the rest of the UK. The farming sector in NI is also much more heavily livestock-based with numbers of cattle and sheep having doubled since the Second World War74. Compared to arable crop based farming in the rest of the UK, Livestock- based agriculture is much more carbon intensive and its production of high levels of nitrogen emissions are a cause for concern75. A complete change in farming practices would be required in NI which makes decarbonisation much more difficult compared to other sectors and jurisdictions.   Decarbonisation of the power sector: Unlike the other devolved administrations, Northern Ireland has devolved responsibility for energy policy. Northern Ireland is a member of the all-island Integrated Single Electricity Market (I-SEM) shared with the Republic of Ireland. Energy policy must enable an efficient, low carbon interconnected energy market to operate on both sides of the border. For the UK to  74 75  Sustainable Agriculture and Land Management Strategy (p.15) Ibid p.26  Providing research and information services to the Northern Ireland Assembly  28  NIAR 47-21  Briefing Paper  achieve Net Zero emissions, the CCC states that NI must achieve equally ambitious decarbonisation in the power sector.   Lack of gas infrastructure: The gas network in Northern Ireland is not nearly as extensive as in GB, with only 24% connected to gas and the rest heated by oil or electric sources. Compared to 87% connected to gas in the UK as a whole. Some pathways to decarbonise heat that rely on modifying the gas network may be less suitable for Northern Ireland. However, the CCC suggests that significant emissions savings could be made by switching conventional oil boilers to heat pumps.   Lack of electric charging infrastructure: The geographical size of Northern Ireland presents an opportunity for more rapid uptake of electric vehicles because range anxiety may be less of a concern for consumers. However, this is offset by the prevalence of longer cross-border journeys and the need for adequate public charging infrastructure on both sides of the border.   The land use, land-use change and forestry sector: Unlike the rest of the UK, the LULCF sector is a net carbon source rather than a net sink. Forest coverage is around 40% lower in Northern Ireland than the UK as a whole. The future inclusion of emissions from degraded peatland in the UK emissions inventory could add around 9% to Northern Ireland's total emissions - higher than in England and Wales, but lower than Scotland.  5.3.1 Further considerations:   Woodland and forestation - the CCC highlights the importance of woodland in sequestering emissions and has identified plans to substantially increase the amount of woodland cover in the UK. NI already has considerably less woodland cover in comparison, due to the nature of livestock farming and dependence on grassland:  • Has the CCC taken into consideration the potential contribution grassland sequestration in NI can make to offsetting emissions?   Future agricultural policy – the advice from the CCC suggests that there will need to be a substantial change in farming approaches in NI, to allow for more forestation and increased use of less carbon intensive practices. Agricultural policy in NI is at a stage of transition post Brexit:76  • Will a new Climate Change Act take into consideration new agricultural policy requirements, or the other way around?  76  Ministerial Statement Northern Ireland Assembly, Official Report (Hansard),Tuesday 17 November 2020 Volume 133, No 2, page 34 http://data.niassembly.gov.uk/HansardXml/plenary-17-11-2020.pdf  Providing research and information services to the Northern Ireland Assembly  29  NIAR 47-21  Briefing Paper  • Is the future agricultural policy to be considered the main vehicle to creating change in farming practices towards meeting NI’s net zero contribution?  • How much can NI de-carbonise agriculture? Does the CCC suggest a move away from livestock farming?  • Based on NI’s past and current practices (livestock and pasture), does NI have suitable soil to crow more crops (e.g. for bioenergy) and increase forestation, to make a considerable enough impact?  • How will changes in practice be encouraged e.g. grants or enforcement?  • Who will provide for grants? • In its advice to Wales, the CCC has suggested that under the right policies, forestation grants can provide a source of revenue for farmers. Can the same be said for NI farmers? And will this be enough to help offset any costs associated with change in practices and new technologies?   The Ireland/NI Protocol - Has the CCC considered the impact of the Ireland/Norther Ireland Protocol, especially in terms of difficulties?:  • e.g. importing trees from the UK and the impacts this is having on DAERA’s forestation programme and the required increases in forestation that the CCC suggest is needed in NI?  • What about the import of new technologies etc. and ensuring they meet EU standards?  • The fact that large power stations in NI remain under the EU ETS, and how this and future CFs might impact net zero contributions,  • Compliance and oversight complexities with EU Commission and Protocol related legislation, potential OEP oversight on non- Protocol legislation and international obligations, and NIEA as the main regulator in NI?   Infrastructure - A number of the approaches to reaching UK net zero and NI’s contribution require better infrastructure, e.g. gas network and electric charging points. This will require significant investment during a time when economic recovery from Brexit and COVID-19 are paramount. The CCC emphasise the importance of CCS and hydrogen use for reaching net zero. In fact, the UK Government’s Hydrogen Strategy is due for publication in Spring 202177 However, the CCC has stated that NI is not a suitable location for CCS. 77  CCC Sixth Carbon Budget Report https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/sixth-carbon-budget/ p.270  Providing research and information services to the Northern Ireland Assembly  30  NIAR 47-21  Briefing Paper  • Has consideration been given by the CCC as to whether NI has the required and sufficient infrastructure to transport hydrogen etc., given the poor gas network currently in NI?  • Has consideration been given as to whether our electric charge network is extensive and efficient enough to deal with encouraged up take of electric cars (and eventual phase out of petrol and diesel cars in the UK)?  • Onshore wind appears the be the most utilised form of renewable energy production in NI, however has consideration been given to NI’s need and ability to expand in this area, e.g. wind farm/turbine saturation and connection capacity to the electric network?   Costs - In the latest advice to Wales, the CCC gave an appreciation of the potential costs for Wales in reaching net zero. Understanding that this is not comparable to NI due to different farming practices:  • What consideration has been given to the costs for NI and its unique circumstances?  • Given it’s a long-term programme to 2050, what is the UK proposing to help support the uptake of new technology in terms of production and supporting demand through creating a market?  • The 2020 Budget set aside £800 million for developing CCS in the UK by 2030. If some of these technologies aren’t suitable in NI, what’s the alternative? What is provided in any future budget for developing alternatives such as offshore wind, tidal? Will there be anything to help develop NI as a location for GHG removal technologies going forward?

A consultation on an outcomes framework for a new PfG is currently out until 22 March 2021. Climate Change is one of the areas identified for developing outcomes in terms of encouraging a green growth approach to reduce emissions, protect the environment and encourage sustainable economic growth.  New Decade, New Approach  Published in January 2020, the new restoration deal states a number of measures and actions to be taken by the NI Executive in relation to addressing climate change and emissions, these include:   The Executive’s strategies to reduce carbon emissions will be reviewed in light of the Paris Climate Change Accord and the climate crisis.    A new Energy Strategy will set ambitious targets and actions for a fair and just transition to a zero carbon society.    The Executive should bring forward a Climate Change Act to give environmental targets a strong legal underpinning.    The Executive will establish an Independent Environmental Protection Agency to oversee this work and ensure targets are met.  Providing research and information services to the Northern Ireland Assembly  32  NIAR 47-21  Cross departmental  Briefing Paper  Investment Strategy 2011-2021  This states that in order to meet climate change targets under the UK Act (at the time), NI must become more energy efficient, switching fuels, changing transport modes and replacing inefficient infrastructure. It also identifies climate change as one of the priority areas for investment under the environment.  Northern Ireland Climate Change Adaptation Programme 2019-2024  The UK Climate Change Act 2008 requires NI departments to prepare an Adaptation Programme. In response to this, DAERA takes the lead in the development of the recently published Northern Ireland Climate Change Adaptation Programme 2019-2024 (NICCAP2). This is NI’s second plan covering the next 5 years. It highlights the priority areas requiring urgent adaptation action across the NICS Departments. It sets the policies, strategies, actions for NICS Departments to address climate change. It also contains chapter for ‘Civil Society and Local Government’. It is hoped this will raise awareness and encourage wider society (sectors outside of government) and local government of the need to adapt and address climate change.78  New GHG Emission Reductions Plan  To aid the NICS wide response to climate change, DAERA takes the lead on the cross-departmental working group ‘Future Generations Working Group on Climate Change’ (FGWG CC). DAERA is taking the lead, through this group, on the development of a draft cross-Departmental GHG Emissions Reductions Plan. According to the latest DAERA discussion document: The plan will set out how the Northern Ireland Government intend to reduce emissions in the following GHG emission sectors: agriculture; energy; transport; business; residential; land use change; public; waste management; and  78  NI Climate Adaptation Programme (p.24) https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/publications/northern-ireland-climate-change-adaptation-programme-2019-2024  Providing research and information services to the Northern Ireland Assembly  33  NIAR 47-21  Briefing Paper  industrial processes. The plan once drafted and agreed by the group will be submitted to the Northern Ireland Executive for their agreement.79  Green Growth Strategy  DAERA is also leading on development of the Executive’s Green Growth Strategy and Delivery Framework in partnership with other departments, local government and stakeholders from across the business and voluntary and community sectors. DAERA Minister describes it as:: The Executive’s overarching multi-decade Green Growth Strategy and Delivery Framework for Northern Ireland is aiming to transform our society towards net zero by 2050, protect and enhance our environment and deliver sustainable economic growth.80 In developing the Green Growth Strategy, DAERA appreciates that a holistic approach is needed across Departments in reaching net zero. DAERA has been engaging with other departments, such as Economy and Infrastructure, to align relevant policies and strategies under the Green Growth Strategy81. According to the latest PfG Outcomes Framework, both DAERA and DfE will bear collective responsibility for addressing climate change through adopting a green growth approach to protect the environment while creating sustainable economic growth. 82  79  DAERA Climate Change Bill Discussion Document (p.23) https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/consultations/climatechangediscussion DAERA (Jan 2021) Poots chairs first meeting of Green Growth Inter-Ministerial Group https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/news/poots-chairs-first-meeting-green-growth-inter-ministerial-group 81 DAERA Climate Change Bill Discussion Document (p.23) https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/consultations/climatechangediscussion 82 Consultation on the Programme for Government draft Outcomes Framework https://www.northernireland.gov.uk/consultations/consultation-programme-government-draft-outcomes-framework 80  Providing research and information services to the Northern Ireland Assembly  34  NIAR 47-21  Briefing Paper  New Circular Economy Strategic Framework  DAERA  DAERA and DfE are working to develop a framework for the Circular Economy in NI. A Cross Departmental Steering Group has been set up. A project began in 2019 and is expected to take 24 months. The aim is for increased collaboration and partnership working amongst CE stakeholders and more joined-up activity between Government Departments, local government and the private sector on CE issues.  NI Greenhouse Gas Reduction Strategy and Action Plan 2011  This sets out measures and actions to reduce emissions from agriculture and farm practices.  Biodiversity Strategy (2015-2020)  Reducing the impact of climate change is one of seven high-level challenges identified by the 2015 strategy. However, according to the UK Climate Change Risk Assessment: Evidence Report, there has not been an assessment of the extent to which Northern Ireland’s network of habitats have the ecological coherence to be resilient to future climate change, as has been done in England though the Lawton Review.83  Waste Management Strategy  Delivery resources efficiently seeks to contribute to addressing climate change through the reduction, increase of reuse and prevention of waste. It includes reducing waste going to landfill which gives of GHGs, the use of more efficient collection methods so waste can be re used (circular economy). It also provides for the implementation of the carrier bag levy and reduction of plastic bags. DAERA is currently developing a new Waste Management Plan for NI as required under the Revised WFD. It aims to consolidate the current Waste Strategy and regional waste management plans under  83  UK Climate Change Risk Assessment: Evidence Report (p.10) https://www.theccc.org.uk/uk-climate-change-risk-assessment-2017/national-summaries/northern-ireland-2/  Providing research and information services to the Northern Ireland Assembly  35  NIAR 47-21  Briefing Paper  one strategic plan with a focus on the circular economy and planning policy under one document.

NI Marine Plan  DAERA is the Marine Plan authority and has consulted on a Draft Marine Plan for NI. Objective 7 of the Plan is to contribute towards climate change mitigation and adaptation measures. The Plan states that public authorities must consider the potential impact of any proposals on greenhouse gas emissions and the proposals ability to adapt to a changing climate.85  Environmental Farming Scheme  Under the current Rural Development Programme 2014-2020, the EFS encourages environmental farming practices to enhance habitat and biodiversity conservation which help address climate change. For example, the management of Natura 2000 conservation sites and peatlands and the protection of soils in order to receive single farm payment. Other schemes under the RDP help to encourage the use of more sustainable machinery, improve resource efficiency etc. For example the Agri-Food Co-operation Scheme (AFCS) and the Farm Business Improvement Scheme (FBIS)86.

Under the strategy’s Action Plan, one of the recommendations is sustainable growth by encouraging consideration of sustainable production and intensification on-farm, more efficient use of resources and more suitable industry incentives for renewable energy. It also seeks to promote NI as a low carbon location for food production88.  Sustainable Agricultural and Land Management Strategy  As recommended under the Going for Growth Strategy, this was produced by an established Independent Expert working Group and presented to DAERA in 2016. It states that the challenge of addressing climate change must be considered in tandem with the need to meet the projected 70% increase in food demand by 2050. As such, the Strategy delivers ways that improve farm incomes and environmental performance simultaneously. It made an addition to the Strategy in 2017 “Making Ammonia Visible.”  Efficient Farming Cuts Greenhouse Gases Implementation Plan 20162020  The plan (and its associated documents) focus on encouraging the implementation of a series of onfarm efficiency measures which can improve farm performance and reduce the carbon intensity of local food production and signposts the support available to facilitate this.  Forests for Our Future  Minister Edwin Poots, MLA launched the ‘Forests for Our Future’ programme, in March 2020, which aims to plant 18 million trees to create 9,000 hectares of new woodland over the next decade to help meet the UK Government net-zero carbon target.

Under goal 4 this Framework flags the direction for NI energy policy to 2020 in relation to enhancing sustainability and addressing climate change. For example, through the promotion of energy efficiency, renewable electricity, renewable energy sources and natural gas. It states that NI will contribute to the UK’s energy saving target of 18% by 2020 (equating to 1.5% energy savings per year at UK level from a 2007 baseline) as set out in the UK’s National Energy Efficiency Action Plan. However, this Framework is being replaced with a new Energy Strategy which finished call for evidence stage in March 2020. The call for evidence Summary Report states that a new energy strategy will identify potential pathways to reach a net zero 2050 target for the energy sector in NI while meeting the energy needs of the population sustainably and cost-effectively.  Economic Strategy  Published in 2012, this provides detail on the Executive’s proposals for growing a prosperous local economy to 2030. It explores options for exploiting market opportunities in emerging sectors aimed at addressing climate change, such as low carbon/green economy. A new draft Strategy (Economy 2030), was published in 2017, however it never progressed. There are current calls to develop a new Economic Strategy for NI, especially in light of COVID-19 and Brexit.  New Skills Strategy  DfE is in the midst of developing a Skills Strategy for NI. Advice given by OECD in terms of what needs to be addressed is the fact that climate change action will have substantial implications for labour market demand. With emphasis on ‘green jobs’ and existing jobs beings transformed in order to meet new demands.  Providing research and information services to the Northern Ireland Assembly  38  NIAR 47-21  Finance  Infrastructure  89  Briefing Paper  Energy Management Strategy and Action Plan  The Strategy seeks to demonstrate the Government’s commitment to emission reductions as required under both the draft PfG indicator 29 (Greenhouse gas emissions) and the UK wide Climate Change Act to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% by 2050. One of the ways it hopes to contribute is an objective to lower net energy consumption by 30% by 2030 across Government (from a 2016/17 baseline year).  Energy efficiency in public buildings  As part of its climate change programme, the government aims to improve the energy performance of the buildings they occupy. This will also reduce the emission of greenhouse gases which are contributing to global warming, as well as reducing costs, thereby releasing resources for improved service provision.  Building Regulations  Technical Booklet F1 (dwellings) and F2 (non-dwellings) regulations set the standards for the energy performance of both new and existing buildings. The main compliance target for new build dwellings in Northern Ireland are carbon emissions. Since December 2020, all new buildings must be ‘Nearly zero-energy buildings’ (NZEB).  Flooding  Produced by the DfI Rivers Agency to meet the requirements of the EU Flood Directive, were subject to consultation in the first six months of 2015. Final Plans were completed and published in December 2015 and are available online. The plans take into account current risk as well as climate change for a medium probability scenario for 2030, as included in the updated flood maps89.

Water UK – Net Zero 2030 Routemap  This UK wide strategy includes the devolved administrations and provides water companies with a framework on which to develop and cost their own net zero action plans. It states that it is in line with Northern Ireland Water’s goal to fully exploit innovative approaches to energy and new technology to reduce its carbon footprint and ultimately become carbon neutral.90  A Long-Term Water Strategy for Northern Ireland (2015-2040)  Published in March 2016, contains a long-term vision to manage flood risk and drainage in a sustainable manner, which will help to address the future risks from climate change.  Regional Development Strategy 2030  The RDS recognises climate change as a major environmental threat, therefore one of its aims is to reduce NI’s carbon footprint and facilitate mitigation and adaptation to climate change. It sets out measures on transport, energy and the location of jobs and houses to help address and adapt to climate change.  P.7 of the UK Routemap  Providing research and information services to the Northern Ireland Assembly  40  NIAR 47-21  Briefing Paper  SPPS  The Strategic Planning Policy Statement states that the planning system should help mitigate and adapt to climate change by shaping new and existing developments in ways that reduce: greenhouse gas emissions, transport needs, flooding threat and erosion, energy and heating requirements.91 The provisions of the SPPS must be taken into account in the development of local development plans (LDPs), and are also material considerations to all planning applications and appeals.  Transport  91  Regional Transportation Strategy (20022012)  Makes reference to efforts to meet the Kyoto Protocol and states that whilst seeking to meet the economic and social needs of the population, will do so in a manner that reduces the threat to the environment.  NI Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) Strategy 2025  Makes reference to RDS and draft PfG objectives for climate change and emissions.

The e-car public charge point network in NI is owned, operated and maintained by the Electricity Supply Board (ESB). It consists of 160 double-headed 22kW fast charge points and 17 rapid charge points available at various locations across the country. Charge points are now also being provided independently by a range of other organisations to provide workplace access and for customers. These can be found at shopping centres, hotels and at some locations in the public sector estate.92 This will help to contribute to the UK’s ban on petrol and diesel cars by 2030 – the use of oil and gas in NI is a reserved matter.

These commitments cover competition policy, subsidy control, state-owned enterprises, taxation, labour and social standards, environmental protection and climate change. Level playing field provisions in trade agreements are there to ensure competition is open and fair and that businesses from one trading partner do not gain a competitive advantage and undercut rivals from another. The TCA has the most extensive provisions seen in any free trade agreement to date. Level playing field negotiations The divergent positions of the EU and UK Government led to the level playing field being one of the most contentious areas of the negotiations. Referring to UK-EU geographical and economic proximity, the EU proposed that legally binding commitments be included in the agreement, with EU rules and standards as a reference point, and a commitment to strong domestic enforcement mechanisms. The UK Government said the UK would maintain the highest standards in the level playing field areas, but the ability to set its own laws was central to its vision. It would not accept alignment with EU rules and obligations that go further than commitments in standard free trade agreements. The most substantial disagreements arose over subsidies, where the EU proposed that the UK follows EU state aid rules as they change over time. The UK proposed to base its commitments on World Trade Organization anti-subsidy rules with weaker enforcement mechanisms. The differences on environmental and climate, labour and social standards, concerned how far the parties should remain “dynamically aligned”. The UK and EU disagreed over whether they be prohibited from lowering labour and environmental standards (nonregression clause), and whether one party should have to raise its standards if the other party raised theirs (the ratchet clause). The Agreement The resulting provisions in the TCA represent a compromise to find a balance between sufficient guarantees that future divergence of regulations would safeguard fair competition and the freedom of the parties to set their own rules for social and environmental protection and subsidy policy. The main level playing field provisions are set out in Title XI of Part Two of the TCA. The EU and UK recognise that to prevent distortion of “trade or investment” between the parties, conditions are required to ensure a level playing field for open and fair competition. The TCA says that while the UK and EU are committed to maintaining and improving their respective high standards, they reaffirm their right to regulate and recognise that the purpose of the commitments is not to harmonise those standards. Subsidies The TCA requires both the UK and EU to have an effective system of subsidy control but neither has to comply with the rules of the other. Both subsidy control regimes must follow common “broad principles”. These principles have to ensure that subsidies are proportionate, transparent and contribute to public policy goals.  5  Commons Library Briefing, 20 May 2021  A distinct feature is that one of the parties can take unilateral remedial measures if there is evidence that a subsidy of the other party risks creating a “significant negative effect” on UK-EU trade and investment. The TCA provisions on subsidies do not amend the state aid provisions of the Withdrawal Agreement Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. This means that EU state aid rules apply to subsidies affecting trade in goods between Northern Ireland and the EU. Non-regression The Agreement’s provisions on labour and social protection, the environment and climate, recognise that both the UK and EU may establish their own levels of protection, without harmonising their rules. Non-regression provisions are there to ensure that protections are not reduced below the levels at the end of the transition period if that would affect trade or investment. The UK and EU both commit to maintaining effective oversight and enforcement systems, with administrative or judicial means of challenge and redress. In the chapter on competition, both sides agree to maintain a domestic system that addresses anti-competitive business behaviours. A chapter on state-owned enterprises focuses on preventing anti-competitive practices among companies where governments are involved. Provisions on taxation include commitments to have good tax governance. Dispute settlement provisions The TCA has complex and bespoke provisions for dispute settlement between the parties. This involves consultations, recourse to an independent arbitration tribunal, and temporary cross-retaliation. The Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) has no role in the dispute settlement provisions. The provisions on competition policy and taxation are excluded from the dispute resolution. The most innovative aspect of the Agreement’s dispute settlement is a rebalancing mechanism for the level playing field. If significant divergence in subsidy policy, labour and social policy, or climate and environment policy, arises between the UK and EU, and this has material impacts on trade or investment, both parties have the right to take countermeasures, subject to arbitration. In simple terms, if one side raises its standards and the other does not, the former can take reciprocal action. These rebalancing measures could include temporary suspension of parts of the Agreement or tariffs, but are not defined beyond that. Further provisions allow for a review of the ‘Trade’ heading of the TCA. This is in case of a persistent dispute, including on the application of the relevant level playing field commitments. This mechanism opens up the possibility of the entire trade part of the agreement being suspended.  6  The UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement: Level Playing Field  1. Overview 1.1 Negotiations Commitments on Level playing field are among the key elements of the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement. 1 They concern cross-cutting provisions for competition, subsidies, taxation, labour and social standards, environmental protection and climate policies, which are not linked to a particular sector of cooperation. The purpose of these provisions is to ensure that competition is open and fair and that businesses of one party do not gain a competitive advantage and undercut their rivals in another country by avoiding the costs of more stringent regulations. The negotiations on the level playing field provisions were contentious. In the non-binding Political Declaration that accompanied the 2019 Withdrawal Agreement the EU and UK set out a joint commitment to an ambitious economic partnership. The Political Declaration would form the departure point for the UK and EU negotiations. In the document, referring to the geographical proximity and economic interdependence of both markets, the parties agreed to ensure that commitments to “a level playing field for open and fair competition” will underpin their economic partnership. The precise nature of these commitments would be “commensurate with the scope and depth of the future relationship”. This would be ensured by “robust commitments” – upholding the common high standards applicable at the end of the transition period in the areas of state aid, competition, social and employment standards, environment, climate change, and relevant tax matters. 2 Following the UK’s withdrawal from the EU on 31 January 2020, the UK and EU entered formal negotiations in March 2020, with the aim of securing agreement on their new partnership by the end of the year. From the start of the negotiations, the UK and EU had fundamentally different approaches to the level playing field. The EU said that it would agree a free trade deal with zero tariffs and zero quotas only if the UK agreed to level playing field commitments. The EU emphasised that the UK-EU trading relationship was fundamentally different from that with its other trading partners due to geographic and economic proximity. This would justify legally binding commitments, with EU rules and standards as a reference point, and strong enforcement mechanisms domestically. The UK Government reiterated the principle of sovereignty and it’s right to regulate. It stated that the UK would maintain the highest standards in the level playing field areas but could not agree to obligations that go further than commitments in standard free trade agreements. The Prime  1  2  Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, UK/EU and EAEC: Trade and Cooperation Agreement, CP 426, 30 April 2021 (‘TCA’) Political Declaration setting out the framework for the future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom, 19 October 2019  7  Commons Library Briefing, 20 May 2021  Minister’s written statement of 3 February 2020 on UK-EU relations set out the Government’s position: The Government will not agree to measures in these areas which go beyond those typically included in a comprehensive free trade agreement. The Government believes therefore that both Parties should recognise their respective commitments to maintaining high standards in these areas; confirm that they will uphold their international obligations; and agree to avoid using measures in these areas to distort trade. 3  For the level playing field areas, the EU and UK positions converged on competition, state-owned enterprises, and taxation (with an exception on tax avoidance). However, substantial divergences appeared with regard to subsidy control, social and labour regulation, environmental regulations, and the fight against climate change. For further analysis of the UK and EU negotiating positions see Commons Library briefing 8852, The UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement: Level Playing Field, section 1. See also Commons Library briefings 8834, The UK-EU future relationship negotiations: process and issues, sections 3 and 4.4; and 8977, UK-EU future relationship negotiations update: is an agreement possible?, section 3. Despite some aspects of the level playing field – future (dis)alignment of subsidy rules and the enforcement of non-regression of labour and environmental standards – being among the most difficult subjects in the negotiations, parties reached an agreement on 24 December 2020.  1.2 Level playing field in the TCA Level playing field provisions are set out in Title XI of Part Two [Level Playing Field for Open and Fair Competition and Sustainable Development] of the Agreement. Chapter I of Title XI contains the general provisions. The Parties recognise in Article 355 that in order to prevent distortion of 'trade or investment' between the EU and UK, conditions are required to ensure a level playing field for open and fair competition. The Agreement should also contribute to the objectives of sustainable development. While the parties commit to maintaining and improving their respective high standards, they recognise that the purpose of the commitments is not to harmonise these standards. Article 365 reaffirms the right of the parties to regulate. It acknowledges the precautionary approach to potential threats of serious or irreversible damage to the environment or human health (see further, section 7.1 below). Parties also commit to following the relevant scientific and technical information, and international standards and guidelines when they develop new regulations in the area of environmental protection and labour conditions. Most modern free trade agreements contain provisions of some sort to uphold certain (international) labour or environmental standards or include pledges to maintain open competition. The TCA has the most 3  UK/EU relations: Written statement, HCWS86, 3 February 2020  8  The UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement: Level Playing Field  extensive provisions on level playing field seen in any free trade agreement to date. 4 Chapter 2 of Title XI covers competition. The positions of the UK and EU converged on competition issues during the TCA negotiations. Both sides agree to maintain a competition law system that addresses anticompetitive behaviours. The UK and EU now operate separate competition regimes. The TCA does not change the UK or EU competition law rules, which are substantially the same but may diverge in the future. The UK and EU agree to enforce competition law in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner, and have competition authorities which shall co-operate on their activities. The general provisions on dispute settlement do not apply to the competition provisions. Mutual commitments on subsidy control are set out in Chapter 3. Both the UK and EU are required to have an effective system of subsidy control and an independent body to oversee it from 1 January 2021. However, the Agreement does not require the UK Government to set up a control mechanism before any subsidy is paid out, as is required under the current EU regime. The UK can itself determine the precise nature of its domestic subsidy control regime and the role of any independent enforcement body, within the principles and rules agreed in the TCA. The chapter on subsidies sets out the common “broad principles” according to which UK and EU subsidy control would operate. These principles have to ensure that subsidies contribute to achieving public policy objectives by addressing market failures or social problems. They have to be proportionate, necessary, and be the appropriate instrument to achieve the objectives. Their positive effect has to outweigh any negative impact on mutual trade. Some subsidies are partially exempt from the TCA provisions, for example, temporary subsidies granted in response to a national emergency. Certain subsidies are prohibited if they “have or could have a material effect on trade or investment between the Parties”. Conditions are created to grant subsidies in some areas, for example sustainable energy. Chapter 3 further contains provisions on domestic enforcement, a bespoke dispute settlement mechanism and unilateral remedial measures. Besides an independent enforcement body, the subsidy control system requires that the courts must be able to hear claims from interested parties, review subsidy decisions and grant effective remedies, in accordance with each party’s domestic law. A unique feature for subsidies is that either side can intervene in the other’s domestic court proceedings concerning the subsidy rules if the court permits it to do so. Additionally, a mechanism must be in place to recover subsidies which 4  International Trade Committee, Oral evidence: UK-EU trading relationship, HC 1206, 22 April 2021, Qq 110, 112  9  Commons Library Briefing, 20 May 2021  are provided unlawfully. However, if a subsidy is granted by an Act of Parliament, a recovery will not be required. The TCA contains a set of specific provisions to address disputes on the application of subsidy provisions. The provisions on subsidies in the Agreement do not amend the state aid provisions (Article 10) of the Withdrawal Agreement Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, meaning that EU state aid rules apply to subsidies affecting trade in goods and wholesale electricity between Northern Ireland and the EU. 5 The TCA does not explain how the provisions of the TCA and Protocol will interact. In Chapter 4 of the Agreement the UK and EU commit to ensuring that state-owned enterprises, companies with special rights, and designated monopolies, do not engage in anti-competitive practices or discriminatory and abusive behaviour creating barriers to trade and investment. These provisions put private businesses on an equal footing with businesses where the governments are involved when the latter engage in commercial activities. Chapter 5 briefly deals with taxation. The agreement contains a commitment to good governance and upholding the taxation standards on exchange of tax information, anti-tax avoidance and transparency. The common provisions refer to international standards, including OECD standards. Finally, this aspect of the agreement is excluded from the general arrangements for dispute resolution. For provisions on labour and social protection, and the environment and climate, the Agreement recognises that both the UK and EU may establish their own levels of protection. 6 As a European Parliament assessment sets out: Standards are not meant to be harmonised, but the parties endeavour to maintain and improve their respective high standards. The parties affirm each other’s right to set their policies and priorities. 7  At the same time, a form of non-regression approach is used which requires that the level of protection is not lowered below the level in place at the end of the transition period if that would impact trade or investment between the UK and EU. This means that in order to demonstrate a breach of the non-regression clause either party would have to show that any attempt to lower labour or environmental standards affects UK-EU trade or investment. The Institute for Public Policy Research has described this qualification as “setting a very high bar for proof”. 8  5  6 7  8  HM Government, Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community, 19 October 2019, [Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland, p292]  TCA, Chapter 6 [Labour and Social Standards], Chapter 7 [Environment and Climate] European Parliament note, First appraisal of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, PE 662.902, March 2021, p10 Marley Morris, The agreement on the future relationship: first analysis, IPPR, p7  10 The UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement: Level Playing Field  The UK and EU both commit to maintaining effective oversight and enforcement systems, with administrative or judicial means of challenge and redress. Chapter 8 sets out the foundations and broad objectives for trade and sustainable development. This is based primarily on the principles of and commitments to international agreements such as the Rio Declaration and the Sustainable Development Goals. The parties also commit to promote and implement the core labour standards recognised in the International Labour Organisation’s (ILO) eight Fundamental Conventions.  1.3 Dispute resolution mechanisms The dispute settlement mechanisms are central to the TCA architecture and must ensure the enforcement of the level playing field. The mechanisms deployed in this area are complex and the procedures vary between policy areas. Both the main TCA dispute settlement mechanisms apply, and additional bespoke mechanisms are set out for subsidies, labour standards, environment and climate. These are discussed in more detail in section 8 below. Provisions on competition policy and taxation are excluded from the dispute settlement mechanisms altogether. The most innovative aspect of the agreement dispute resolution process is a rebalancing mechanism for the level playing field set out in Article 411. In certain circumstances, both parties have the right “to take countermeasures if they believe they are being damaged by measures taken by the other party in subsidy policy, labour and social policy, or climate and environment policy”, subject to arbitration. 9 This would be the case if significant divergences between the UK and EU in those areas would arise and have material impacts on trade or investment. In simple terms, if one side raises its standards and the other does not, it can take reciprocal action, subject to independent assessment by an arbitration tribunal. The mechanism in the agreement foresees that, if consultations between the UK and EU are unsuccessful, either party can take unilateral temporary and proportionate “rebalancing measures,” based on “reliable evidence” and not on “conjecture or remote possibility”. Exactly what measures may be taken, or how connected they must be to the area of divergence, is not specified, suggesting that they need not be limited to the precise matter at dispute. The other party may challenge any such measures before an arbitration tribunal. This rebalancing mechanism is reciprocal, as opposed to the unilateral mechanisms initially proposed by the EU. As the UK Government’s summary document notes, if the rebalancing mechanism is triggered too frequently either side can initiate a review of the relevant provisions and the trade aspects of the TCA more broadly  9  HM Government, UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement: Summary, December 2020, para 81  11 Commons Library Briefing, 20 May 2021  and this may lead to adjustment of the balance of rights and obligations. There is uncertainty as to how the level playing field provisions of the Agreement will be applied in practice and what effect they will have on specific sectors and on the UK-EU trading relationship in general. During the negotiation of the TCA, there were significant differences in the UK and EU positions on labour and social standards, and environmental protection. They concerned the extent to which the parties should remain “dynamically aligned” and be prohibited from lowering labour and environmental standards (non-regression), and whether one party should have to raise its standards if the other party chose to raise theirs (ratchet clause). There was also a discussion on dynamic alignment with EU state aid rules. The resulting TCA does not require that the UK follows EU rules as they evolve. However, Sussex University UK Trade Policy Observatory researchers argue that the rebalancing mechanism included in the TCA constitutes a defensive version of dynamic alignment, in that rather than focussing on cooperation and harmonisation it provides alternative means for one side to coerce the other. But triggering the rebalancing mechanism of Article 411 repeatedly could have a rather destabilising effect on the overall cooperation: … if there is a series of rebalancing episodes, if either party triggers the review provided for in [Article 411], or anyway in the standard five-yearly review, there are likely to be high feelings on both sides of the table. That is, far from smoothing the path to cooperation, stability and certainty, the dispute settlement processes of the LPFs Title could have exactly the opposite effect. That, inevitably, will discourage investment in anything that depends on the smooth flow of UK-EU trade. 10  1.4 Parliamentary scrutiny UK Parliament The UK Parliament passed legislation enabling the ratification and domestic implementation of the TCA on 30 December 2020 and the Agreement entered into provisional application on 1 January 2021. Since then parliamentary select committees have scrutinised aspects of the TCA on several occasions, including provisions on the level playing field. •  Committee on the Future Relationship with the European Union, Oral evidence: Progress of the negotiations on the UK’s future relationship with the EU, HC 203, 6 January 2021  •  HL European Union Committee, Uncorrected oral evidence: Future UK-EU relations: governance, 2 February 2021  •  HL European Union Committee, 21st Report of Session 2019-21 Beyond Brexit: the institutional framework, HL 246, 22 March 2021  10  Emily Lydgate, Erika Szyszczak, L.

Parliament’s Resolution welcomed the agreement’s “modern” level playing field provisions which “should be considered as a model for other future Free Trade Agreements negotiated by the EU”. The Parliament also emphasised its key concerns for the level playing field: ─  The need to ensure that significant divergence with material impact on trade or investment is broadly interpreted and can be demonstrated in a practical manner to ensure that the ability to use such measures is not unduly restricted.  ─  The need to monitor the new UK State aid regime and assess the efficacy of the mechanism to address unjustified subsidies; It recalled that provisions on the level playing field apply in a general manner, including in so-called special economic zones. This is a reference to the UK Government’s plans to finance a number of new Freeports, “hubs for global trade and investment,” across the UK.  ─  Regretting the limited provisions on taxation, the EP requested the Commission remain vigilant on questions of taxation and money laundering. It suggested a possibility to review this relationship four years after the entry into force of the Agreement should imbalances arise. 11  ─  How a future possible unilateral lowering of social and labour standards by the UK would be addressed and contested under the Agreement. 12  During the debate, MEPs from all major political groups stressed the importance of having enforceable level playing field provisions, including for social and environmental standards.  11  12  European Parliament Resolution of 28 April 2021 on the outcome of EU-UK negotiations, para 18 European Parliament Resolution of 28 April 2021 on the outcome of EU-UK negotiations, para 32  13 Commons Library Briefing, 20 May 2021  2. Competition policy 2.1 Negotiating positions The positions of the UK and EU converged on competition issues during the TCA negotiations. Other EU and UK free trade agreements contain comparable provisions and adhere to similar principles of transparency, non-discrimination, and procedural fairness.  UK position The UK’s negotiating objectives (Chapter 21), which were published on 27 February 2020, highlighted a desire for both parties “to maintain effective competition laws, covering merger control, anticompetitive agreements and abuse of dominance, while maintaining the right to provide for public policy exemptions”. The document argued that there is no need for legal or regulatory alignment. Rather, it promoted “regulatory freedom to respond to new and emerging challenges in these areas.” 13 It argued for “transparent, non-discriminatory rules and enforcement procedures” and “effective cooperation”. With one exception, chapter 22 of the May 2020 UK draft Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement was if anything more general than the provisions set out in the earlier negotiating objectives, referring generally to principles of “free and undistorted competition” and the importance to all of taking action against “anti-competitive business conduct”. 14 But paragraph 3 of Article 22.2 included a new emphasis on the importance of “cooperation and coordination” between competition authorities to achieve this, going as far as admitting the possibility of “a separate agreement” on effective competition law. The proposed approach would reflect recent agreements with Canada, Japan and South Korea in excluding competition issues from the wider dispute resolution mechanism.  EU position The EU’s negotiating directives adopted on 25 February proposed that: 97. The envisaged partnership should provide that anticompetitive agreements, abuses of dominant position and concentrations of undertakings that threaten to distort competition are prohibited, unless remedied, in so far as they affect trade between the Union and the United Kingdom. The Parties should also commit to effective enforcement via a competition law and domestic administrative and judicial proceedings, permitting the effective  13  14  HM Government, The Future Relationship with the EU: The UK’s Approach to Negotiations, CP 211, 27 February 2020, Chapter 16 HM Government, Draft working text for a Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union (CFTA), 19 May 2020, Chapter 22  14 The UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement: Level Playing Field  and timely action against violations of competition rules, and to effective remedies. 15  Section 2 of the EU draft Agreement of 18 March 2020 elaborates on commitments in competition set out in the negotiating directives. Anticompetitive practices are prohibited as far as those affect trade between the UK and the EU. There is no direct reference to EU competition law, but much of the text is “derived from EU law (largely copied from the EU treaties) and enforceable in the courts of each party”, which would by extension require the UK “to apply competition rules essentially identical to those in force in the EU”. 16 There are provisions regarding cooperation on policy development and cooperation between competition authorities. Provisions on competition would not be covered by the Agreement dispute settlement mechanism (Part Five, Title II), except for the requirement to have an enforcement body.  2.2 The TCA The TCA only briefly deals with competition policy in Chapter 2, Articles 358-362. In it, the EU and the UK “recognise the importance of free and undistorted competition”. Both agree to maintain a competition law system that addresses •  agreements and practices that seek to prevent, restrict or distort competition  •  abuses of dominant positions, and  •  mergers or acquisitions (for the EU, “concentrations”) which have anti-competitive effects. This competition law system must apply to all economic actors regardless of nationality or ownership status.  The TCA does not change the substance of UK or EU competition law rules, which are substantially the same. So currently, what is likely to be unlawful under EU competition rules is also likely to be unlawful under UK competition rules. In the future, however, UK courts are not required to follow EU competition case-law. Divergences are likely to emerge over time. There is also the potential for parallel European Commission and UK Competition and Markets Authority investigations of the same conduct, if that conduct impacts trade both between EU Member States and, separately, in the UK. 17 The UK and EU now operate separate competition regimes.

Transactions now need to satisfy merger control rules in both the UK and EU. 18 Each party is allowed an exemption from such competition law for “legitimate public policy objectives”, so long as these exemptions are transparent and proportionate to those objectives. The UK and EU agree to enforce competition law in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner, and have competition authorities which shall co-operate on their activities. This includes the exchange of information. In future, the UK and EU may enter into a separate agreement on co-operation and co-ordination between the European Commission, the competition authorities of the EU Member States and the UK’s competition authority, which may include conditions for the exchange and use of confidential information. Officials from the UK and EU have indicated that they are keen for such an agreement to be finalised soon. It might include enhanced co-operation, mutual notifications and coordination of enforcement. 19 Consistent with the negotiation positions of both sides, the general provisions on dispute settlement (Title I of Part Six) do not apply to the competition provisions.  Standards in other EU trade agreements Other EU trade agreements contain provisions on competition that are comparable to the TCA. Canada Chapter 17 of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) sets out arrangements for competition, highlighting “the principles of transparency, non-discrimination, and procedural fairness”. Any exclusions will be transparent and both parties will share relevant information about such exclusions. There are no arrangements for dispute settlement. CETA also refers to a more detailed 1999 agreement between the EU and Canada on the application of competition laws. Japan Chapter 11 of the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement, which builds on a 2003 agreement on anti-competitive activities, promotes similar principles. It permits exemptions, “provided that such exemptions are transparent and are limited to those necessary for securing public interest. Such exemptions shall not go beyond what is strictly necessary to achieve the public interest objectives that have been defined by that Party”. The agreement is not subject to wider arrangements for dispute resolution. South Korea Chapter 11 of the EU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement of 2010 also highlights general principles of the type mentioned above.

Subsidy control 3.1 Negotiating positions Background Subsidy control was one of the most controversial areas during negotiations over the TCA and one of the last issues to be resolved. Both the EU and UK have a mutual interest in robust controls of state support to businesses, which could ensure fair competition and trade with the other party. Despite this, both sides adopted different approaches to future cooperation on state aid/subsidies. 21 The UK sought to protect its regulatory autonomy and avoid provisions in this area that would go further than free trade agreements “normally” do. The EU saw alignment on state aid rules as essential to prevent UK subsidies to industries from threating to undercut EU businesses in the future.  UK position As an EU Member State, the UK was part of the EU regime for state aid (see box 1 below). While Theresa May’s Government was considering some form of incorporation of EU state aid rules in the UK rulebook, Boris Johnson’s Government rejected any form of alignment with the EU in this area. Referring to the principle of sovereignty it rejected EU influence over UK domestic policy through state aid controls. The government also chose to use the term ‘subsidies’ instead of ‘state aid’, which is an EU law term. 22 Box 1: EU State aid rules As an EU Member State, the UK was part of the EU regime for state aid. The EU state aid controls are specifically aimed at creating a level playing field for businesses in the Single Market. Under Article 107 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, state aid is prohibited, if it threatens to distort competition and trade between EU Member States. 23 State aid refers to national public authorities offering grants, tax reliefs and various other forms of support, which favour specific businesses or industries. Member States are required to get European Commission clearance before making state aid available to businesses (ex-ante assessment). In practice, more than 90% of EU state aid is exempted from this procedure. See further Commons Library briefing 6775, EU State Aid Rules and WTO Subsidies Agreement  As set out in its statement of 3 February 2020 on UK/EU relationships, the UK Government did not believe that to secure future cooperation it was necessary to be bound by an international treaty or guided by shared institutions in subsidies policy. Such commitments could hamper its aspirations to develop “separate and independent policies” on state aid. It was seeking a regime that is WTO-compliant and does not go  21  22  23  HL European Union Committee, Internal Market Sub-Committee, Uncorrected oral evidence: The level playing field and state aid, 27 February 2020, Q8 For background on (dynamic) alignment with evolving EU state aid rules see Commons Library briefing 8852, The UK-EU future relationship negotiations: Level Playing Field, 19 June 2020, section 2 Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union [2012] OJ C326, Art. 107-108  18 The UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement: Level Playing Field  beyond the provisions included in other free trade agreements, such as CETA. The Government’s negotiating objectives, The future relationship with the EU. The UK’s approach to negotiations of 27 February (Chapter 20) stated that reciprocal commitments on subsidies should be in line with the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM) 24 and could go beyond it regarding transparency, which would be comparable to the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement. While the SCM Agreement covers only trade in goods, the government was willing to extend its commitments to cover trade in services too. This was a concession to the EU position as EU state aid rules cover all trade and do not distinguish between goods, services or movements of capital. The EU’s proposal was to base the UK state aid regime on EU state aid law. That would involve a role for the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) which has an exclusive competence to interpret EU law. The UK Government consistently ruled out “any jurisdiction for the CJEU over the UK’s laws”, or “any supranational control in any area”. 25 The UK’s draft UK-EU Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (CFTA), had a separate chapter on subsidies (Chapter 21). The proposal referred to WTO anti-subsidy rules as basis for cooperation on subsidies. Under the proposed terms, both sides would agree to notify each other biannually of their subsidies. A party concerned about a subsidy adversely affecting its interests would be able to request a consultation. The other party would give “full and sympathetic consideration” to that request and would use its “best endeavours” to address the adverse effects. The provisions would not be subject to the dispute settlement procedures of the Agreement.  EU position From the outset of the negotiations the EU indicated that the enforcement of state aid rules was one of its main concerns among the level playing field obligations. Following the approach set out in the Political Declaration, the EU’s negotiating directives required upholding “the common high standards” with regard to state aid and other areas. But they added a request for “corresponding high standards over time with Union standards as a reference point”. The EU requested that EU state aid rules apply “to and in the UK”. 26 The EU draft Agreement on the New Partnership with the United Kingdom operationalised the positions set out in the Council’s 24  25  26  The WTO rules on state aid/ subsidies are laid out in the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM). This agreement frames the use of subsidies and the actions countries can take to protect their markets from the effects of another country’s subsidies.

Further, the UK would be required to establish an independent enforcement authority. The UK would also have been required to ensure that its courts could apply state aid rules and could refer questions of interpretation of EU state aid law to the CJEU. In addition, the European Commission would have legal standing before UK courts to bring cases in respect of state aid measures adopted by UK authorities and would have a right to intervene in cases. These provisions would give EU law an unprecedented extra-territorial effect in a third country. 28 Disagreements would be settled through a consultation mechanism within the Specialised Committee on Level Playing Field and Sustainability (SCLPF) and the agreement’s overarching dispute settlement mechanism would apply. The EU would be able to take “interim measures” if, for example, consultations failed or the SCLPF could not come to an agreement on whether the UK had adopted new EU state aid provisions. 29 Agreements between the EU and third countries include varying degrees of commitments on state aid/subsidy controls. Generally, the closer the market integration, the more state aid or anti-subsidy rules form part of the agreement. 30 The EU’s initial proposal compared to the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement, with the trading partner having its own independent regime which is based on full application of EU state aid rules. As stated above, the UK proposal was to follow the agreements building on the WTO rules-based systems such as CETA and the EUJapan Economic Partnership Agreement which have relatively week enforcement provisions. 31  Seeking a compromise Throughout the first months of negotiations the UK and EU positions on state aid remained deadlocked. However in July 2020 the EU signalled willingness to drop its demand that the UK accepts future EU state aid rules (dynamic alignment) and CJEU oversight. 32 In exchange it expected the UK to sign up to a “shared philosophy” on future subsidy policy in combination with some form of equivalence mechanism where the UK  27  28  29  30  31  32  European Commission, Draft text of the Agreement on the New Partnership between the European Union and the United Kingdom, UKTF(2020)14, 18 March 2020, Title III, Chapter Two, Section 1 Nikos Lavranos, EU UK agreement: an analysis of the EU’s proposed dispute settlement provisions, Borderlex, 23 March 2020 The text did not explain the nature of such interim measures, but common understanding was that they would refer to tariffs on goods or (partial) suspension of the agreement. This is similar to ‘remedial measures’ included in the TCA. Morris Schonberg, “Continuity or change?

The UK Government reiterated in a statement on subsidy policy on 9 September 2020, that from 2021, the UK will no longer follow EU state aid rules but the WTO rules on subsidies. It will honour its obligations regarding subsidies included in its future free trade agreements. The government also reassured that it did not intend to adopt “1970s policies” of bailing out unsustainable companies. 33 The government’s statement of 9 September sat alongside the UK Internal Market Bill which was introduced in Parliament on the same day. The Bill as presented would empower Ministers to unilaterally reinterpret and disapply provisions on state aid in the Withdrawal Agreement Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland. It appeared that these controversial provisions could break the UK’s legal obligations under the Withdrawal Agreement and international law to enact the Protocol. In response, the European Commission launched infringement proceedings against the UK. The provisions were eventually removed from the Bill, which has now become the UK Internal Market Act, but these developments put further pressure on the negotiations. See for background Commons Library Briefing United Kingdom Internal Market Bill 2019-21, 14 September 2020, Sections 6.5 and 6.8. On 7 October, The UK’s Chief negotiator David Frost confirmed to the House of Lords EU Committee that the EU had dropped the request of dynamic alignment with EU state aid rules. He disclosed that the UK had submitted a proposal on basic principles on subsidy policy. These principles focussed on transparency and proportionality of subsidies and would have regard for the effect of subsidies on trade and investment. Frost confirmed that the UK was willing to commit to such common principles, which are “important parts of a good subsidy system”. But the level of detail on domestic policy, that the EU had been asking for, was to be decided after a domestic consultation followed by a possible legislative process. 34 Thus, the domestic setup of the UK subsidy system could not be part of the negotiation. A path to a compromise was emerging.  3.2 The TCA: Definitions and scope Subsidy control provisions are covered in Chapter 3, Articles 363-375. The Agreement requires both UK and EU to have an effective system of subsidy control with an independent body to oversee it from 1 January 2021. Crucially, the UK has the right to regulate; it may determine the precise scope of its regime, within the principles and rules agreed in the TCA.  33  34  The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), Government sets out plans for new approach to subsidy control, 9 September 2020 HL Committee on the European Union, Uncorrected oral evidence: Progress of negotiations on the future UK-EU relationship, 7 October 2020, Q8  21 Commons Library Briefing, 20 May 2021  The TCA defines a subsidy in Article 363 without referring to concepts of EU law, but it is seen by many as generally similar in scope. 35 A subsidy concerns financial assistance paid from the public purse, in various forms, including grants, loans or guarantees, foregone revenue or provision of goods and services. Also tax measures can be subsidies in some circumstances. A subsidy confers economic advantage and is specific – it benefits certain economic actors above others. A subsidy must have actual or potential effect on trade or investment between the Parties (Article 363 (1) (b)). Article 364 limits the scope of a “subsidy”, exempting compensations for the damage caused by natural disasters. Lesser conditions apply to other exceptional non-economic occurrences, such as a pandemic, and focussed responses to global economic emergencies. It is also made clear that subsidies of a social nature to consumers, rather than businesses, are allowed. There is a new de minimis threshold of roughly £335,000 below which a subsidy is exempt. Further, the rules do not apply to agricultural and fisheries sectors, and the audio-visual sector, which includes film, broadcasting, and multimedia. Article 365 provides that the principles of subsidy control do not apply to subsidies for services of public economic interest, such as social housing or public transport services to remote areas, if they would obstruct the delivery of such services. Generally, authorities compensating an entity for the service provision should be transparent, avoid overcompensation and prevent cross-subsidising other activities outside the scope of public interest. The subsidy control chapter of the TCA does not apply to compensations which amount to less than £795,000 over a period of three years.  3.3 Principles of subsidy control Mutually agreed principles of subsidy control are covered in Article 366, and should be applied to determine the legality of an individual subsidy where this could have a material effect on trade or investment between the parties. See box 2 below. Box 2: TCA principles of subsidy control (Article 366) Each party must have an effective system of subsidy control that ensures that the granting of a subsidy respects the following principles: (a) subsidies pursue a specific public policy objective to remedy an identified market failure or to address an equity rationale such as social difficulties or distributional concerns (“the objective”) (b) subsidies are proportionate and limited to what is necessary to achieve the objective (c) subsidies are designed to bring about a change of economic behaviour of the beneficiary that is conducive to achieving the objective and that would not be achieved in the absence of subsidies being provided (d) subsidies should not normally compensate for the costs the beneficiary would have funded in the absence of any subsidy  35  Phedon Nicolaides, One Agreement, Two Parallel Systems: Subsidies in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and the UK, lexxion.eu, 5 January 2021  22 The UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement: Level Playing Field  (e) subsidies are an appropriate policy instrument to achieve a public policy objective and that objective cannot be achieved through other less distortive means (f) subsidies’ positive contributions to achieving the objective outweigh any negative effects, in particular the negative effects on trade or investment between the parties.  Certain subsidies that have or could have material effect on UKEU trade, are prohibited and others are subject to conditions (Article 367). The prohibited subsidies include unlimited state guarantees, and state support to rescue ailing or insolvent businesses without a realistic restructuring plan. However, such subsidies would be permitted in order to avoid social hardship, job losses or service disruption. Subsidies to banks and credit institutions are allowed subject to a credible restructuring plan and a prospect of long-term viability. Exports subsidies for goods and services are prohibited, with some exceptions such as export credit guarantees. Also subsidies conditional on domestic content are prohibited. Subsidies to air carriers are allowed in exceptional circumstances. Article 367 (13) sets out specific rules for large cross-border or international cooperation projects. Article 367 (14) regulates subsidies to sustainable energy and environmental sustainability. Phedon Nikolaides, Professor of European economic law at Maastricht University has noted that the TCA allows subsidies that contribute to public policy objectives: Without explicitly stating so, [the TCA] allows subsidies that pursue a public policy objective, comply with certain principles, such as those of necessity and proportionality, and generate positive effects that outweigh their negative effects on trade and investment. 36  In sum, “any subsidy in any form escapes from the obligations laid down in the Agreement if it has no ‘material effect’ on trade or investment”. 37 An additional Joint Declaration on Subsidy Control Policies covers subsidies for the development of disadvantaged areas, transport, and research and development. The Joint declaration provides non-legally binding guidance on what “appropriate subsidy policies” in these areas would entail. For example, beneficiaries of subsidies for the development of disadvantaged or deprived areas should be required to provide substantial contribution to the investment costs of a project. Also, the main purpose of regional aid should not be attracting businesses to relocate from the EU to the UK or vice versa. George Peretz QC of Monckton Chambers assesses: The value of these latter declarations is largely to make it clear that the UK government, committed to major investment in both transport and R&D, can do so within the framework of the  36  37  Phedon Nicolaides, One Agreement, Two Parallel Systems: Subsidies in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and the UK, lexxion.eu, 5 January 2021 Ibid  23 Commons Library Briefing, 20 May 2021  Agreement – though it will be observed that it could also have done so within the framework of EU State aid rules. 38  Transparency The Parties commit to principles of transparency around subsidy controls (Article 369), agreeing to make information on individual subsidies and the names of recipients available on a public database or website. For this purpose, the UK Government has set up a new transparency database on gov.uk. The UK has also agreed to ensure that an interested party – for example a competitor of the beneficiary or a trade association – which intends to apply for a court review of a subsidy, has access to the relevant information about the subsidy. This would enable it to assess the application of the subsidy control principles of Article 366 and make an informed decision about its claim and the issues at stake. The transparency provisions are more profound than the commitments in FTA’s like CETA. Box 3: UK Guidance and future Subsidy Control Bill On 31 December 2020, the government published guidance for public authorities which award subsidies, explaining their responsibility for the assessment of compliance with the UK’s international commitments on subsidy control. 39 A consultation about the design of a bespoke approach to UK domestic subsidy control ran from 3 February until 31 March 2021. The UK Internal Market Act (Section 52) reserves to the UK Parliament the exclusive ability to legislate for a subsidy control regime. Later this year, the government is expected to bring forward a Subsidy Control Bill to establish a subsidy control system in domestic law.  3.4 Independent enforcement body The TCA subsidy provisions require that the UK establishes an “operationally independent” enforcement authority (Article 371) with an “appropriate role”. The Agreement does not require the government to assess subsidies in advance, or introduce a standstill period until a subsidy is cleared, as the EU state aid regime requires. So far the UK Government has not set up a subsidy control authority.  3.5 The role of courts Besides an independent enforcement body, Article 372 requires that the courts are competent •  to review subsidy decisions taken by granting authorities or the independent body,  •  to hear claims from interested parties, and  •  to impose effective remedies, in accordance with either party’s domestic law.  38  George Peretz, The subsidy control provisions of the UK-EU trade and cooperation agreement: a framework for a new UK domestic subsidy regime, Monckton Chambers, 28 December 2020 HM Government, Guidance Complying with the UK’s international obligations on subsidy control, 31 December 2021, para 3.2  39  24 The UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement: Level Playing Field  That means a case can be brought through the domestic legal system of either side rather than through an arbitration procedure of the TCA. A unique feature is that, with the permission of the court, either party can intervene in the other’s domestic court proceedings. This is a weakened down provision from the EU’s initial proposal to have legal standing to bring cases before UK courts. Further, both parties must put a mechanism in place to recover subsidies which have been successfully challenged before a court. However, if a subsidy is granted by an Act of Parliament, recovery will not be required (Article 373).  3.6 Dispute settlement and remedies The Agreement contains a complex set of bespoke provisions to address disputes on subsidies. First, there is the option of a consultation. If a consultation does not solve the dispute, a complaining party can take unilateral remedial measures, subject to arbitration. When a dispute relates to concerns over significant divergence of the subsidy control policy, parties can take rebalancing measures. A consultation procedure is established under Article 370. It allows a party to request information on how the subsidy control principles of Article 366 have been respected in an individual case, if it considers that a subsidy (potentially) has a negative effect on trade or investment between the UK and EU. The party can escalate the case, requesting consultations within the Trade Specialised Committee on Level Playing Field for Open and Fair Competition and Sustainable Development which “shall make every attempt to arrive at a mutually satisfactory resolution of the matter”. This consultation procedure, notes Kotsonis, “should also help flush out any potential concerns over the compliance of a subsidy that could otherwise escalate into a dispute”. 40 In more concerning instances, if either party considers that the other’s individual subsidy presents a serious risk of causing “a significant negative effect on trade or investment between the parties,” it can request information and consultations under the Article 374 Remedial measures procedure. 41 If there is evidence to that serious risk, a party can “unilaterally take appropriate remedial measures.” These measures have to be limited to what is strictly necessary and proportionate. Articles 374 (5) and 374 (6) stipulate that the existence of a serious risk of a significant negative effect must be backed by facts and reliable evidence, and not merely based on “allegation, conjecture or remote possibility”. The other party can challenge the complainant’s remedial measures if it considers them excessive, and request a ruling of an arbitration tribunal in accordance with the Part Six provisions on dispute settlement. The tribunal will assess whether the remedial measure of the complainant is proportionate. If the complainant fails to comply with the arbitration 40  41  Totis Kotsonis, “The Squaring of the Circle: Subsidy Control Under the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement”, European State Aid Law Quarterly, Volume 20, Issue 1, 2021, pp561-575 The Partnership Council may maintain an illustrative list of what might amount to a significant negative effect on trade or investment (Article 374 (7)).  25 Commons Library Briefing, 20 May 2021  ruling, the other party can take remedial action in response. The arbitration tribunal will conduct its proceedings in accordance with Article 760 which sets outs an expedited process for establishing the tribunal and for the delivery of the tribunal’s final ruling. 42 Article 375 sets out that if one of the parties more generally fails to comply with the subsidy commitments of the TCA, the other may refer the matter to the horizontal dispute settlement procedure of the TCA (Title 1, Part Six). This does not apply to provisions on the independent body (Article 371) and courts (Article 372). An arbitration tribunal under the TCA will have no jurisdiction over the assessment and recovery of individual subsidies. The rebalancing mechanism (Article 411) applies to the TCA commitments on subsidies (see section 8.5 below), in a similar manner it applies to labour and social, environmental standards or climate protection. The rebalancing mechanism provides that the parties can take “rebalancing measures” where significant divergence between the UK and the EU on subsidy control gives rise to “material impacts on trade and investment between the parties”. A remedial measure and a rebalancing measure cannot be applied at the same time to remedy the impact of the same subsidy (Article 374 (15)). Both remedial measures and rebalancing procedures for subsidies require that the assessment of a subsidy’s impacts must be based on “reliable evidence and not merely on conjecture or remote possibility.” Kotsonis summarises the differences between the remedies under the two procedures: In terms of substance, there would not appear to be any material differences between what might count as ‘remedial’ or ‘rebalancing’ measure; both might involve the imposition of tariffs or quotas or the suspension of certain other preferential access commitments. However, on the basis that significant divergence in subsidy control policies would herald a systemic divergence in the way in which Parties approach subsidy control, this is likely to lead to longer term and wider distortive effects on level playing field conditions than the grant of any one or more time-limited subsidies. Accordingly, where a rebalancing measure is justified, this would seem to permit, in principle, the adoption of more draconian trade defence measures than that which would seem justifiable in the context of a remedial measure. 43 In critique of the dispute settlement mechanism for subsidies, Nicolaides has pointed out that the system of remedial measures available to a  42  43  For a detailed description of the subsidy dispute resolution procedure see Commons Library briefing 9139, The UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement: governance and dispute settlement, section 5.1 Totis Kotsonis, “The Squaring of the Circle: Subsidy Control Under the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement,” European State Aid Law Quarterly, Volume 20, Issue 1, 2021, p571  26 The UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement: Level Playing Field  party in response to the other’s harmful subsidies is “an inefficient system because it counters one distortion by creating another”. 44 The review mechanism described in section 8.8 below also applies to subsidies, making it possible to review or ultimately suspend the Trade title of the agreement if rebalancing measures have been taken too frequently. In addition to the above dispute resolution procedures, with regard to trade in goods, Article 32 contains provisions on anti-dumping and countervailing measures which can be used to remedy the effects of harmful subsidies of the other party. 45 Article 32 states that antidumping and countervailing measures are to be applied in accordance with the provisions of the WTO SCM Agreement, which allows for investigations into the effects of subsidised imports on the domestic prices and industry. Countervailing measures can be introduced to offset the injury caused to domestic industry.  3.7 Issues and commentary A compromise solution There is a consensus among state aid/subsidy law specialists that the UK has done well in the negotiations in achieving independence from EU state aid rules and the jurisdiction of the CJEU. 46 At the same time, the TCA subsidy provisions are, as professor Kenneth Armstrong puts it, a “delicately balanced” compromise with the EU objectives. The provisions are not as thin as the UK sought in terms of the WTO SCM Agreement. Instead, “the Agreement itself is the direct source of detailed substantive definitions of what constitutes a subsidy, certain prohibitions and any exceptions.”47 The resulting regime is substantially more robust than if the system was based merely on the WTO anti-subsidy commitments, and imports the EU approach to assessment of subsidies, argues subsidy law expert Totis Kotsonis. [I]n providing that subsidies should be granted only when they are consistent with the Subsidy Principles, the TCA imports an approach which is aligned with the assessment which the European Commission itself carries out in determining State aid compatibility with the internal market under EU law. 48  44  45 46  47  48  Phedon Nicolaides, One Agreement, Two Parallel Systems: Subsidies in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and the UK, lexxion.eu, 5 January 2021 TCA, Title I Trade in Goods, Chapter 1, Article 32 Trade remedies See for example, Emily Lydgate et al., Phedon Nicolaides, James Webber, George Peretz, Marley Morris Kenneth Armstrong, An Uneven ‘Level Playing Field’ – the EU/UK Trade Agreement, University of Cambridge, 19 January 2021 (accessed May 2021) Totis Kotsonis, “The Squaring of the Circle: Subsidy Control Under the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement”, European State Aid Law Quarterly, Volume 20, Issue 1, 2021, p574  27 Commons Library Briefing, 20 May 2021  While consciously avoiding direct reference to concepts of EU law, the resulting regime is in substance, if not in form, rather similar to the structure under the EU State aid rules. 49 The resulting TCA provisions are a new model of managing divergence, unprecedented in any other free trade agreement. International Trade Committee was told that the TCA would not limit the UK’s freedom to negotiate new free trade agreements with third countries. The TCA sets a high bar, which the UK would have no intension to surpass with third countries. 50 Flexibility in deciding policy priorities The UK has achieved significant freedom in various policy areas previously regulated by specific EU state aid rules. The Sussex University Trade Policy Observatory (UKTPO) notes: The UK […] has negotiated for higher de minimis and public service subsidy thresholds, for special provisions to allow for a post-COVID19 special recovery programme to level up regions and to be able to keep a check on how the Member States of the EU use public money to stimulate their economies. It has also ensured that general provisions relating to tax and infrastructure projects will not be caught by the subsidy rules and that the dispute mechanisms that address problems with EU state aid and UK subsidies are independent of the European Commission and the European Courts. 51  In policy areas such as environment and energy, research & development, or support for SMEs, where the UK has strong interests and towards which it has directed state aid in the past, the provisions of the TCA are general or absent, whereas the corresponding provisions in EU rules are much more complex. It can be argued that the UK will be able to grant larger subsidies to its companies without breaching the TCA in comparison to those which are allowed in the EU . 52 The threshold to demonstrate that a subsidy harms trade and investment is higher under the TCA than under EU rules. Independence from the EU regime could present an opportunity to the UK to make its domestic subsidy controls more permissive and efficient. 53 James Webber, partner at Shearman & Sterling writes in Taking advantage of the opportunity presented by the UK’s new subsidy control regime (27 January 2021) that the UK can now, for example:  49  50  51  52  53  George Peretz, The subsidy control provisions of the UK-EU trade and cooperation agreement: a framework for a new UK domestic subsidy regime, Monckton Chambers, 28 December 2020 International Trade Committee, Oral evidence: UK-EU trading relationship, HC 1206, 22 April 2021, Q119-120 E.

The bar of demonstrating that a subsidy has “material effect” on trade under the TCA and is therefore out of bounds, is high. The Government would therefore consider the effects of a subsidy within the UK when deciding whether to spend the money in the first place. 54 Uncertainty about domestic effects TCA subsidy provisions leave much of the internal settlement open to the UK Government’s discretion. There’s a degree of uncertainty about how the new UK commitments on subsidies will be implemented in practice and what these changes will mean for specific policy areas. Finding the balance between flexibility under the TCA and certainty for public authorities and businesses benefitting from subsidies may not be easy. 55 For example, the TCA does not require the UK independent authority to assess the compliance of individual support measures – a role which was previously performed by the European Commission. The resulting uncertainty about individual subsidies could be addressed by introducing general block exemptions for certain types of subsidies. Experts argue that without such guidance, the burden on granting authorities would require resources and expertise to assess compliance and would still leave authorities open to legal challenge. 56 Kotsonis notes that the current UK subsidy system “lack[s] any consideration for a subsidy’s potentially distortive effects on competition in the UK internal market,” or the UK internal subsidy competition, as opposed to competition with the EU. This issue may be clarified in the government’s legislative proposals for UK subsidy control which are expected after the results of the recent consultation have been published. 57 See box 3 above and Commons Library Briefing 9139, UK subsidy policy: first steps for the issues facing the independent UK state aid regime.

As described above in section 1.4, the European Parliament is seeking assurances that “significant divergence with material impact on trade or investment is broadly interpreted” and that the enforcement mechanisms work in practice. It has specifically noted that provisions on the level playing field apply to UK Government’s plans such as the freeports programme. But, as the International Trade Committee heard from James Webber, if EU subsidies have an adverse effect on the UK, the EU will have to consider that to a much greater degree than it would have to consider it in respect of any other third country. 58 The effect on the Northern Ireland Protocol The TCA provisions on subsidies in the Agreement do not amend the state aid provisions (Article 10) of the Withdrawal Agreement Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. Under the Protocol, in order to prevent undue distortion of competition and trade, EU state aid rules continue to apply to subsidies that affect goods and the wholesale electricity market, insofar as these can affect trade between Northern Ireland and the EU. Experts generally agree that the application of Article 10 of the Protocol alongside the TCA can create legal and practical issues in the future. State aid/subsidy experts have pointed out that under EU state aid rules, the Northern Ireland Protocol could also be interpreted as applying further than just Northern Ireland and covering business support in Great Britain. George Peretz QC & Alfred Artley have explained: EU state aid rules do not simply bite upon acts of the devolved and local government bodies in Northern Ireland, and those measures adopted by the UK government that are Northern Ireland-specific; rather they also catch all-UK measures (or measures affecting only part of the UK), whatever UK authority takes those measures, as long as they meet the test. 59  For example, a UK-wide tax measure, benefitting a NI business might be caught by the EU state aid enforcement regime as it could potentially affect trade between NI and the EU. 60 This is often referred to as “reach-back” of EU state aid rules. The EU sought to address UK concerns about the “reach-back” of the Protocol’s state aid provisions, by giving a clarification in a unilateral declaration in the Withdrawal Agreement Joint Committee on Article 10(1) of the Protocol. However, the issue is not settled and the UK and EU views of the extent of “reach-back” appear to diverge. The UK Government’s Technical Guidance on subsidy control (paragraph 7.1) points out that the “reach-back” situation could arise in certain, limited circumstances. But the European Commission’s Notice to Stakeholders on state aid after the departure of the UK from shows a wide  58  59  60  International Trade Committee, Oral evidence: UK-EU trading relationship, HC 1206, 22 April 2021, Q126 George Peretz QC, Alfred Artley, State aid under the Northern Ireland Protocol, Tax Journal, 15 May 2020 EU powers to review UK state aid under Irish Border Protocol to be assessed 'case by case', MLex, 24 January 2020; G.Peretz QC in “Boris Johnson’s efforts to escape EU state aid rules ‘mistaken’”, Financial Times, 9 February 2020;  30 The UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement: Level Playing Field  interpretation of which measures can “affect trade” between Northern Ireland and the EU. 61 Experts have argued that co-existence of the two subsidy regimes in the UK may cause confusion and uncertainty for UK public authorities and companies. Some have called for the Protocol’s state aid provisions to be replaced for the TCA regime during the negotiations or at some point in the future. 62 See Commons Library Briefing UK subsidy policy: first steps, section 2.3 for further detail on state aid provisions in the Northern Ireland Protocol.  61  62  European Commission Notice to stakeholders, Withdrawal of the United Kingdom and EU rules in the field of state aid, 18 January 2021 See for example George Peretz, The UK’s new subsidy regime: a marsh of uncertainty, Monckton Chambers, 1 January 2021; James Webber, International Trade Committee, Oral evidence: UK-EU trading relationship, HC 1206, 22 April 2021, Q119  31 Commons Library Briefing, 20 May 2021  4. State-owned enterprises and designated monopolies 4.1 Negotiating positions The issues around state owned enterprises were not contentious during the negotiations as both the UK and EU agree that state-owned enterprises and companies with special rights should not engage in anticompetitive practices or discriminatory and abusive behaviour creating barriers to trade and investment. Provisions on state-owned enterprises and designated monopolies put private businesses on an equal footing with businesses where the governments are involved. They ensure that provisions on fair competition in the agreement are not undermined by the unfair behaviour of such companies when they engage in commercial activities. In their draft agreement texts, both the UK and EU proposed largely similar commitments on state-owned enterprises, which were in line with existing EU FTAs, including CETA (Chapter 18) and the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement (Chapter 13). The proposed obligations would address anti-competitive behaviours of state-owned enterprises, designated monopolies (sole suppliers of a particular service) and commercial enterprises to which public bodies have granted special rights in order to perform particular services. The latter can refer to services such as energy, water, public transport or certain social services, which public authorities contract out to private businesses but financially support their provision.  Background With growing global participation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in cross-border trade and investment, various countries have moved to support effective competition among all market participants, both publicly and privately owned. There are, for example, initiatives in the framework of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The principle of competitive neutrality, central to this policy area, implies that companies are not advantaged (or disadvantaged) on the market solely because of their ownership or nationality. In the recent years, stand-alone chapters on state-owned enterprises have been included in free trade agreements. 63 The EU has its own rules on state-owned enterprises and entities entrusted with certain public services. Their core principle is that such enterprises are subject to competition and state aid rules in the same way as any other business to the extent these rules do not obstruct their ability to perform the services entrusted to them. 64  63  64  Minwoo Kim, Regulating the Visible Hands: Development of Rules on State-Owned Enterprises in Trade Agreements, Harvard International Law Journal, Vol. 58, No 1, 2017 OECD, Competitive Neutrality and state-owned enterprises: challenges and policy options, OECD Corporate governance working papers, 2011, p12  32 The UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement: Level Playing Field  4.2 The TCA In line with the proposals brought forward during the negotiations, Chapter 4, Articles 376-382, of the TCA covers state-owned enterprises, enterprises granted special privileges, and designated monopolies (‘covered entities’). When carrying out commercial activities these enterprises must act in accordance with commercial considerations and may not discriminate against goods, services or entities of the other party (Article 380). The TCA refers back to relevant international standards, including the OECD Guidelines on Corporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises, which each party shall respect (Article 381). Chapter 4 does not apply to enterprises if the size of their revenues derived from commercial activities is below a defined threshold. 65 In addition, the provisions do not apply when covered enterprises (Article 377): •  act as procuring entities, that is, buyers in government procurement,  •  supply services in exercise of government authority,  •  provide certain financial services (for example offering export and investment support, mandated by the government), or  •  provide audio-visual services or some other services.  Each party commits to having an independent and impartial regulatory body (Article 381). Article 382 sets out the mechanism to exchange information between the parties in case one has reasons to believe that its interests are being adversely affected by the commercial activities of a covered entity. Relevant to fair competition between publicly owned and commercial enterprises are the provisions on subsidy control that apply to services of public economic interest (Article 365). They limit market-distorting advantages such as excessive government subsidies for a public service, which a company could use to boost its commercial activities. The UK Government’s assessment of the provisions is that they make the best use of international standards when regulating them, in line with provisions in other FTAs. Recognising the increasing impact on trade of state-owned companies in a number of countries, both sides also support new or improved international trade rules to capture any market-distorting behaviour of state-owned enterprises and promote competitive neutrality.66  65  66  100 million Special Drawing Rights in any one of the three previous consecutive fiscal years Department for International Trade Press Release Britain is back: Liz Truss calls for new rules at WTO to tackle unfair trade practices, 3 March 2020; European Commission Communication, Trade Policy Review - An Open, Sustainable and Assertive Trade Policy, Annex COM(2021) 66 final, 18 February 2021, pp8-9  33 Commons Library Briefing, 20 May 2021  5. Taxation 5.1 Negotiating positions Background While the TCA was being negotiated it was generally assumed that any future UK-EU agreement would not contain any substantive provisions regarding tax. Historically, taxation has remained largely a Member State competence. The major exception to this generalisation is indirect tax: primarily VAT – for which there is a substantive body of EU law establishing common rules across Member States – and, to a lesser extent, excise duties. There are no equivalent provisions with regard to other taxes, though all national legislation has to comply with the overarching provisions of the Treaty guaranteeing the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital across the Single Market and prohibiting discrimination. 67 Concerns about the scale of tax avoidance and evasion, both across the EU and internationally, have resulted in the introduction of a number of EU instruments relating to administrative cooperation to exchange information and help tackle tax evasion. The Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland in the draft Withdrawal Agreement agreed in November 2018 included level playing field commitments regarding taxation, though, in comparison to other areas, these were relatively brief and appear to have been uncontroversial. Both parties committed to implementing the principles of good governance in the area of taxation, including global standards on transparency and exchange of information, fair taxation and OECD standards against Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS). 68 The UK stated that it would continue to apply its domestic law which transposes EU Directives on the exchange of information on taxation (Directive 2011/16), anti-tax avoidance rules (Directive 2016/1164), and countryby-country-reporting by credit institutions and investment firms (Directive 2013/36). Finally the UK reaffirmed its commitment to curb harmful tax measures as defined in the EU Code of Conduct for business taxation (a political agreement, as opposed to a legal instrument, agreed in 1997). 69 The revised Political Declaration, agreed in October 2019, mentioned taxation in its discussion of level playing field provisions, noting that the parties should “commit to the principles of good governance in the area of taxation and to the curbing of harmful tax practices”. 70  67  68  69 70  For more details see, HM Government, Taxation report: review of the balance of competences, 28 November 2012 For more details see, Commons Library briefing 5945, Corporate Tax Reform 20102020, 2 April 2021, section 6.2 Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration, 25 November 2018, pp353-4 Political Declaration setting out the framework for the future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom, 19 October 2019, para 77. An overview of the EU initiatives to tackle harmful tax competition is provided on the Commission’s site (accessed May 2021).  34 The UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement: Level Playing Field  EU position The EU’s draft future relationship agreement confirmed its view that a commitment to “implement the principles of good governance in the area of taxation” should feature in a future UK-EU agreement, and that at the end of the transition period the UK should apply common standards to those applicable in the EU in a number of tax-related areas: •  the exchange of information on income, financial accounts, crossborder tax rulings, country-by-country reports between tax administrations, beneficial ownership and potential cross-border tax planning arrangements,  •  rules against tax avoidance practices, and  •  public country-by-country reporting by credit institutions and investment firms.  The EU proposed that the Partnership Council (see section 8) could modify the common standards in order to include additional areas or to lay down higher standards. 71  UK position The Government’s draft Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement set out the UK’s general commitment to good tax governance (not subject to any dispute resolution mechanism), omitting the EU’s supplementary requirement for non-regression on certain aspects of tax. 72 There was little material change in either party’s position on this issue following the Commission’s draft negotiating directive in February 2020, 73 and the UK Government’s negotiating objectives which followed it. In the latter case the negotiating objectives simply noted that “the Agreement could include commitments to the principles of good tax governance as reflected in international standards,” but “should not constrain tax sovereignty in any manner”. 74 In his assessment of the level playing field published in March 2020, the IPPR’s Marley Morris took the view that in the area of tax, the UK “would probably seek to water down the proposals for the UK to follow specific areas of EU law, given this conflicts with the UK’s position of regulatory autonomy” although “there is most likely greater scope for compromise than in competition and state aid policy, given any disagreement here would relate to a relatively limited area of EU law”. 75  71  72  73  74  75  European Commission, Draft text of the Agreement on the New Partnership with the United Kingdom, UKTF (2020) 14, 18 March 2020 pp32-3 HM Government, Draft UK-EU Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (CFTA), 19 May 2020, p259 See European Commission, Recommendation for a Council Decision authorising the opening of negotiations for a new partnership with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, COM(2020) 35, 3 February 2020, paras. 94-5 HM Government, The Future Relationship with the EU: The UK’s Approach to Negotiations, CP211, 27 February 2020 p17 Marley Morris, Negotiating the level playing field, IPPR, 5 March 2020, p14  35 Commons Library Briefing, 20 May 2021  David Frost, the UK’s chief Brexit negotiator, gave evidence to the House of Lords EU Select Committee on 28 May 2020. Asked what the EU proposes beyond non-regression, regarding taxation he said: Tax is a bit different; it is not normally part of an FTA in quite this way. [The EU] are proposing commitment to good governance and OECD standards, where we do not have a big difference between us, of course. They are proposing non-regression on three specific tax measures about anti-avoidance, which really equate to EU directives, again policed by a dispute settlement mechanism that involves the European Court of Justice. We have some problems with that aspect of this. Generally on tax we have similar principles, as you would expect. 76  5.2 The TCA As anticipated the TCA only briefly deals with taxation (Chapter 5: Articles 383-5). The agreement retained the commitment to good governance (Article 383), although the Commission’s proposal that this refer to EU Code of Conduct, as well as the relevant OECD provisions, was dropped. The agreement retained provision with regard to nonregression, but referred to standards agreed at OECD level, and not EU directives (Article 384). Finally provision to exclude this aspect of the agreement from the general arrangements for dispute resolution was retained (Article 385). The European Commission’s Q&A document on the TCA provides a summary of this section: How will you ensure that taxation isn’t used as a means to distort competition? The Parties agreed on a good governance clause and commitments to uphold the taxation standards on exchange of tax information, anti-tax avoidance, and public tax transparency. These provisions are based on international standards, including OECD standards, related to the exchange of tax information; rules on interest limitation, controlled foreign companies and hybrid mismatches, as well as on the Party’s domestic standards related to public country-by-country reporting. In addition to that, the EU and the UK set out, in a separate jointdeclaration, specific principles on the countering of harmful tax regimes and affirmed jointly their commitment to apply these principles. They also agreed to hold an annual dialogue on their application of these principles. 77  The joint declaration on countering harmful tax regimes is one of the series of declarations accompanying the TCA. 78 In their overview of the TCA, the Institute for Government note, “the commitments for taxation do not in any way prohibit the choice to lower or raise taxes. They refer to international standards on preventing 76  77  78  HL European Union Committee, Uncorrected oral evidence: Progress of UK-EU future relationship negotiations, 28 May 2020, Q4 European Commission, Questions & Answers: EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, 24 December 2020 See, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, UK/EU and EAEC: Trade and Cooperation Agreement, CP 426, 30 April 2021 (Declarations, p2523)  36 The UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement: Level Playing Field  tax avoidance”, adding, “the commitments are not enforceable and are similar to what is found in other EU free trade agreements”. 79 Writing on the prospect of future tax competition between the UK and the EU, Alison Dickie and David Haworth (Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer) underline that in these provisions “the key is that in each instance it is the OECD rather than the EU understanding of these rules that the UK has committed to maintain”. They go on to observe, in relation to the joint declaration that, “it is understood that the EU’s aim” in concluding this “was to replicate the EU code of conduct on business taxation”: This is not currently binding on EU Member States which would seem to explain the rationale for including this as a less onerous commitment in a political declaration separate to the TCA. Nonetheless, it is expected that this will be sufficient to ensure the UK does not undo BEPS related changes to its patent box regime in a bid to attract IP heavy businesses to the UK. 80  The writers concluded that part from the restrictions imposed by the TCA “opportunities remain” for the UK to make its tax regime more competitive but that it seemed “likely that divergences” between the two regimes “will in any event develop over time”. 81 In its summary document on the TCA the Government made a few observations on these provisions (emphasis added): Chapter 5: Taxation 88. The Agreement commits both Parties to uphold global standards on tax transparency and fighting tax avoidance (which the UK has played a leading role in developing and implementing through the G20 and OECD). It contains commitments to specific tax standards as they stand at the end of the transition period, including the international standards on exchange of information, anti-tax avoidance, as well as relevant standards in legislation on public country by country reporting by credit-institutions and investment firms. 89. The commitments on tax between the UK and the EU are also captured in a stand-alone Joint Political Declaration on Countering Harmful Tax Regimes. This is a political commitment to the principles of countering harmful tax regimes, and reflects the work done by the OECD in this area. 90. There are no provisions constraining our domestic tax regime or tax rates. 82  79  80  81  82  Institute for Government, UK–EU future relationship: the deal - Level playing field (accessed May 2021) “Brexit: tax competition between the UK and the EU27”, Tax Journal, 12 February 2021.

However, the taxation chapter provides an additional legal basis for these commitments. The taxation chapter also carries a symbolic value, which is in line with the EU Good Tax Governance Agenda. Article 5.1 of the TCA on “[g]ood governance” almost reproduces the EU standard provision on good tax governance for agreements with third countries issued by the Council of the European Union in June 2018. 83 From this perspective, the EU–UK TCA could pave the way for the integration of similar provisions in future trade agreements concluded by the EU. 84  83  84  Council conclusions on the EU standard provision on good governance in tax matters for agreements with third countries [2018] OJ C193/5 (6 June 2018).

Labour and social protection 6.1 Negotiating positions It is common for free trade agreements (FTAs) to contain provisions on labour and social standards. The extent to which an agreement should protect labour standards was one of the key areas of dispute during the negotiation of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA). The EU has adopted a wide range of instruments, mostly directives, on workers’ rights. As a Member State of the EU, the UK was required to implement these directives in domestic law. As a result, a large portion of UK employment law is derived from EU law. For an overview, see Commons Library briefing 9099, End of Brexit transition: Workers’ rights. During the negotiation of the TCA, there were significant differences in the UK and EU positions on labour and social standards. They concerned the extent to which the parties should be prohibited from lowering labour standards (non-regression) and whether one party should have to raise its standards if the other party chose to raise theirs (ratchet clause).  Background As noted above, trade agreements typically contain some provisions on labour standards. Since 2008, the EU has included such provisions in all their FTAs with third countries. The provisions are typically contained in the ‘Trade and Sustainable Development’ chapter of an FTA. A typical EU trade agreement contains the following types of provisions: •  Commitments to certain multilateral standards (e.g. International Labour Organisation conventions)  •  Obligations not to waive or fail to enforce domestic labour laws in order to encourage trade or investment, and  •  Commitments to seek to ensure high levels of labour protection  On the whole, provisions tend to be aspirational or only create soft (non-enforceable) obligations. For example, most EU FTAs do not actually prohibit parties from reducing their domestic labour standards. The enforcement mechanisms for labour provisions in EU FTAs are also relatively weak. Dispute settlement takes the form of arbitration before a panel of experts whose decisions are not binding. The parties cannot normally impose trade sanctions for breaches of labour provisions. 85 The Political Declaration for the future UK-EU agreement, signed in October 2019, said that the agreement should ensure that both parties uphold labour standards set out in EU law at the end of the transition. 86  85  86  For a detailed discussion of labour protections under EU and international FTAs, see: HL European Union Committee, Internal Market Sub-Committee, Uncorrected oral evidence: The level playing field and state aid, 27 February 2020  Political Declaration setting out the framework for the future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom, October 2019, para 77  39 Commons Library Briefing, 20 May 2021  UK position The UK’s February 2020 negotiating objectives said that a UK-EU agreement should contain provision on labour standards that were similar to those in EU trade agreements with other countries, such as Japan and Canada. It said that this would involve a provision that prevented parties from reducing their labour standards in order to encourage trade or investment. 87 The UK published its draft text for a UK-EU free trade agreement (CFTA) on 19 May 2020. The provisions on trade and labour were extremely similar to the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA). Article 27.4 of the UK draft (upholding levels of protection) was, in fact, a word-for-word copy of Article 23.4 of CETA. It stated: 1. The Parties recognise that it is inappropriate to encourage trade or investment by weakening or reducing the levels of protection afforded in their labour law and standards 2. A Party shall not waive or otherwise derogate from, or offer to waive or otherwise derogate from, its labour law and standards, to encourage trade or the establishment, acquisition, expansion or retention of an investment in its territory. 3. A Party shall not, through a sustained or recurring course of action or inaction, fail to effectively enforce its labour law and standards to encourage trade or investment. 88  This provision contained only a soft obligation on reducing domestic labour standards (“recognise that it is inappropriate”). By contrast, it would have prohibited the parties from waiving or failing to enforce their labour standards to encourage trade or investment (“shall not”). The UK draft also contained a soft obligation (“shall strive to”) to continue to improve labour standards in the future. Like CETA, the enforcement provisions in the UK draft included dispute settlement through a panel of experts whose decisions would not be binding. Parties would have been unable to impose trade sanctions in response to breaches of the provisions on labour standards. Domestic legal context In domestic law, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 ensured that “EU-derived domestic legislation” would continue to have force even after the European Communities Act 1972 ceased to have effect at the end of the transition period. This meant most EU-derived workers’ rights would continue to be protected in UK law, although they could be amended or repealed by future legislation. 89  87  88  89  HM Government, The Future Relationship with the EU: The UK’s Approach to Negotiations, CP 211, 27 February 2020, para 75 HM Government, Draft working text for a Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union, 19 May 2020, Art. 27.4 Commons Library briefing 9099, End of Brexit transition: Workers’ rights, 22 December 2020  40 The UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement: Level Playing Field  The Government also stressed that in various areas UK employment law went further than was required by EU law. 90  EU position The EU’s negotiating directives were published on 25 February 2020. They said that due to the geographic proximity and economic interdependence between the UK and the EU, firm commitments were needed. The EU mandate said any agreement should prevent the parties from reducing their labour standards below the level set by EU law at the end of the transition period. It also said parties should uphold high standards “over time with [EU] standards as a reference point”. 91 The EU published its draft text for a UK-EU free trade agreement on 18 March 2020. The provisions on labour standards were similar to those in the November 2018 Withdrawal Agreement (agreed by Theresa May). Article LPFS 2.27 of the EU draft set out a non-regression clause. It said: 1. A Party shall not adopt or maintain any measure that weakens or reduces the level of labour and social protection provided by the Party’s law and practices and by the enforcement thereof, below the level provided by the common standards applicable within the Union and the United Kingdom at the end of the transition period, and by their enforcement. 92  This provision was very similar to Article 4 of Annex 4 to the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland in the 2018 Withdrawal Agreement. That provision was understood as preventing the UK from reducing its labour standards below the level set by EU law at the end of transition. 93 In addition, Article LPFS 2.28 of the EU draft contained a new “ratchet clause”. It said: 1. Each Party shall seek to increase, through its relevant law and practices and through the enforcement thereof, the level of labour and social protection above the level of protection referred to in Article LPFS.2.27 [Non-regression of the level of protection]. 2. Where both Parties have increased, through their relevant law and practices and through the enforcement thereof, the level of labour and social protection above the level referred to in Article LPFS.2.27 [Non-regression of the level of protection], neither Party shall weaken or reduce its level of labour or social protection below a level of protection which is at least equivalent to that of the other Party’s increased level of labour and social protection. 94  The effect of this provision was that if both parties raised their labour standards after the end of the transition period, it would have created a 90 91  92  93  94  See for example HC Deb 29 October 2019 c203 EU General Affairs Council, Directives for the negotiation of a new partnership with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 5870/20, 25 Feb 2020, paras. 94 and 101 European Commission, Draft text of the Agreement on the New Partnership with the United Kingdom, UKTF (2020) 14, 18 March 2020, Art.

LPFS 2.28  41 Commons Library Briefing, 20 May 2021  new baseline of standards below which regression was prohibited. However, if only one party raised its standards, there would have been no hard obligation on the other party to follow. The EU draft said that the provisions on labour standards would be subject to the ordinary rules on dispute settlement that applied to the whole agreement. This meant dispute settlement would take the form of arbitration and that a party could impose trade sanctions in response to a breach of the labour standards provisions. Overall, the EU draft contained significantly stricter obligations than those normally included in EU FTAs. It contained a hard obligation on non-regression (“shall not”) and a ratchet clause and these provisions were subject to stronger dispute settlement procedures.  Negotiations In December 2020, several media organisations reported that the level playing field was one of the key remaining areas of disagreement in the UK-EU negotiations. Reporting suggested that one of the sources of disagreement was the so-called “ratchet clause” and the question of whether one party should have to align with the other if it decides to raise its labour standards. The Irish broadcaster RTE summarised: The European Commission was still looking for some way to ensure that there was a level playing field, that it remained level over time, and that there was a binding mechanism to ensure that was the case. Officials say that because the UK was still not engaging in the idea, the Commission on its own was forced to come up with suggestions. Combined with the impact of the IMB, and the whole question of trust, what it came up with appeared to toughen up the so-called "ratchet" clause, whereby if the EU raised its standards, the UK should as well. If they didn’t, and British firms gained an edge over European ones competing within the same market, there should be the ability for the EU to retaliate with tariffs, or in another sphere. 95  Neither side made public statements on this issue. However, the dispute was resolved and a provision on “rebalancing” was included in the TCA.  6.2 The TCA The provisions on labour standards are contained in Title XI of the TCA (‘Level Playing Field’). There are three key provisions: •  Non-regression from levels of protection (Article 387)  •  Multilateral labour standards and agreements (Article 399)  •  Rebalancing (Article 411)  Overall, the obligations on labour standards are stricter than those normally contained in EU FTAs. Most of the provisions are hard  95  “The level playing field: Brexit for slow learners”, RTE [online], 12 December 2020 (accessed May 2021)  42 The UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement: Level Playing Field  (enforceable) obligations. Furthermore, the parties can take “temporary remedies” (trade remedies) if some of these obligations are breached. 96  Non-regression Article 387 of the TCA sets out a non-regression provision on labour and social protections: 2. A Party shall not weaken or reduce, in a manner affecting trade or investment between the Parties, its labour and social levels of protection below the levels in place at the end of the transition period, including by failing to effectively enforce its law and standards. 97  There are several points that should be noted about this provision. First, like the EU draft, there is a hard obligation (“shall not”) preventing either party from reducing its labour protections. If one of the parties reduces its labour protections in breach of this provision, it could lead to dispute settlement and the imposition of trade remedies (see below). Second, like the UK draft, the obligation only applies where a reduction in protection affects trade or investment between the parties. This means that not every reduction in standards will necessarily be a breach of this provision. Third, as was common between the UK and EU drafts, the parties are prohibited not only from reducing but also from failing to enforce their laws in a manner that affects trade and investment. Fourth, the term “labour and social levels of protection” has a specific definition. It is defined as a party’s laws and standards relating to: •  Fundamental rights at work  •  Occupational health and safety standards  •  Fair working conditions and employment standards  •  Information and consultation rights at company level, and  •  Restructuring of undertakings  For the UK, this captures all domestic legislation in these areas, even if it is not derived from EU law. For the EU, it only captures EU legislation. 98 “In a manner affecting trade or investment” As noted, the non-regression clause only prohibits the parties from reducing labour protections in a manner that affects trade or investment between the parties. This is similar to other EU and international FTAs. However, the use of the term “in a manner affecting” (TCA) rather than “to encourage” (CETA) suggests intent on its own may not be a breach. There have been relatively few arbitration decisions on the meaning of these phrases in the context of provisions on labour standards. The most 96  97  98  See Committee on the Future Relationship with the European Union, Oral evidence: Progress of the negotiations on the UK’s future relationship with the EU, HC 203, 6 January 2021, Q1173 Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, UK/EU and EAEC: Trade and Cooperation Agreement, CP 426, 30 April 2021 (‘TCA’) Ibid, Article 386  43 Commons Library Briefing, 20 May 2021  detailed discussion to date is in the final report of the arbitration panel in US-Guatemala CAFTA dispute. 99 In the US-Guatemala case, the arbitration panel concluded that to “affect” meant to have some “material” impact: We begin by considering the plain meaning of “affecting trade”. Both disputing Parties acknowledge that to “affect” is to “influence” or “make a material impression”. We agree. Action or inaction that is in a manner “affecting trade” must influence or make a material impression upon some aspect of trade, that is, upon the cross-border exchange of goods and services. This means that an interpretation of Article 16.2.1(a) that treated as a violation every failure, through a sustained or recurring course of action or inaction, to effectively enforce labor laws simply because it occurred in a traded sector, or with respect to an enterprise engaged in trade, would not be consistent with its wording. It would require no proof of influence or material impression upon the cross-border exchange of goods and services. It would simply require proof of some effect on an employer or economic sector engaged in trade. This is not the same thing as an effect on trade. Had the CAFTA-DR Parties wished to cover every failure to enforce through a sustained or recurring course of action occurring in a traded sector or with respect to enterprise engaged in trade, they could easily have done so using clearer language. A failure to effectively enforce labor laws must affect some aspect of trade. The question is which effects on trade bring a matter within the scope of Article 16.2.1(a). 100  The panel found that this meant that the measure had to produce some competitive advantage. However, it rejected an interpretation that would require evidence of an impact on prices or trade flows (which it concluded could be impossible to produce). The panel summarised: Thus our enquiry into whether a failure to enforce labor laws is such as to confer a competitive advantage in trade between the CAFTA-DR Parties focused principally on (1) whether the enterprise or enterprises in question export to CAFTA-DR Parties in competitive markets or compete with imports from CAFTA-DR Parties; (2) identifying the effects of a failure to enforce; and (3) whether these effects are sufficient to confer some competitive advantage on such an enterprise or such enterprises. 101  It should be noted that the decision of the panel in the US-Guatemala arbitration does not bind a panel of experts convened under the TCA. As such, it is possible that a panel of experts may interpret provisions in the TCA in a different way. Effective enforcement of labour standards As can be seen above, Article 387 of the TCA prohibits the parties from weakening their labour standards by failing to effectively enforce them in a manner that affects trade or investment. For a discussion of this case see Phillip Paiement, “Leveraging Trade Agreements for Labor Law Enforcement: Drawing Lessons from the US-Guatemala CAFTA Dispute”, Georgetown Journal of International Law, [2017] 49(2), 675 100 In the Matter of Guatemala – Issues Relating to the Obligations Under Article 16.2.1(a) of the CAFTA-DR FINAL REPORT OF THE PANEL June 14, 2017, June 2017, paras 167-168 101 Ibid, para 192 99  44 The UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement: Level Playing Field  Article 388 clarifies that for this purpose enforcement means having an effective system of labour inspections. Parties must also have judicial and administrative routes for individuals to seek redress for breaches of labour laws, including interim relief.  6.3 Multilateral labour standards In Article 399, the parties commit to promote and implement the core labour standards recognised in the International Labour Organisation’s (ILO) eight Fundamental Conventions. These include: •  freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining,  •  the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour,  •  the abolition of child labour, and  •  the elimination of discrimination in employment.  The parties commit to promote the ILO’s Decent Work Agenda. Each party also commits to implement all the ILO Conventions they have ratified, as well as the Council of Europe’s European Social Charter. The importance of this type of provisions was recently evidenced by a dispute settlement between the EU and the Republic of Korea. In Article 13.4.3 of the EU-Korea FTA the parties “commit to respecting, promoting and realising, in their laws” the ILO’s core labour standards. Before a panel of experts, the EU argued that Korea was in breach of this provision due to various deficiencies in its trade union legislation and its failure to implement four of the ILO Fundamental Conventions. Before the panel, Korea argued that the phrase “commit to” meant the provision was aspirational. However, the panel found that the phrase did create binding legal obligation to respect, promote and realise the ILO conventions. The term “respect” meant not interfering with a right and the term “promote” meant ensuring third parties did not interfere with a right. By contrast, the panel decided the term “realise” did not create a requirement to comply with the ILO Conventions but, rather, an obligation to realise the principle of the freedom of association. 102 The wording of Article 13.4.3 of the EU-Korea FTA is broadly similar to Article 399 of the TCA. In fact, under the TCA the parties commit to “effectively implementing” the core labour standards. However, the provisions on multilateral standards in the EU-Korea FTA and the TCA cannot be enforced by trade remedies. Professor Steve Peers explains: However, one similarity between the UK/EU and UK/S Korea treaties is crucial: the relevant provisions are both subject to a relatively limited form of dispute settlement, consisting of consultation followed by expert panels. No trade remedies can result, even if the panel finds a breach of the treaty. On the weak legal effect of a panel report, the EU/UK treaty is even blunter than the ‘best efforts’ clause in the EU/Korea treaty: ‘the Parties share the understanding that if the Panel makes 102  European Commission, Panel of Experts proceeding constituted under Article 13.15 of the EU-Korea Free Trae Agreement: Report of the Panel of Experts, 20 January 2021, paras 123-141  45 Commons Library Briefing, 20 May 2021  recommendations in its report, the responding Party does not need to follow these recommendations in ensuring conformity with the Agreement.’ 103  6.4 Rebalancing As noted above, one of the key areas of dispute during the negotiation of the TCA was the question of whether the agreement should contain a “ratchet clause”. Under the EU draft text, if both parties raised their labour standards after the end of the transition period, it could set a new common baseline below which parties could not fall. Ultimately, the TCA did not include this sort of ratchet clause. However, Article 411 sets out rules on “rebalancing”. It provides that if future divergences between UK and EU standards on labour, environment, climate change or subsidy control cause “material impacts on trade and investment between the parties”, the parties can take “rebalancing measures”, which can include trade remedies. More detailed information on rebalancing measures and the process for implementing and challenging them are set out below. However, in the context of labour standards, there are several points to note. First, the threshold for triggering rebalancing measures is different from the threshold for triggering the non-regression provisions. A party will be in breach of the non-regression rules if it reduces its labour standards in a “manner affecting” trade or investment. By contrast, rebalancing measures can only be taken if divergence causes “material impacts” on trade and investment. Second, for a number of reasons it is not clear exactly how divergence between the UK and the EU will be assessed. In the first instance, the EU only has limited competence in the field of labour and social standards, meaning many issues are left to individual Member States. 104 This would suggest that divergence can only arise in areas where the EU has the competence to act. In addition, it is not clear whether divergence can only arise from future acts of the parties or whether existing divergences can trigger the obligation, such as in areas where the UK has gone further than EU law. More broadly, as with the non-regression provisions, it may be difficult to show that a particular divergence has impacted trade or investment. Professor Catherine Barnard noted this issue in oral evidence to the Committee on the Future Relationship with the European Union: Going forward, which is where the rebalancing kicks in, when might the rebalancing mechanism apply to future developments in labour law? The question is what happens if the EU, as it might do, starts legislating a bit more enthusiastically in the field of labour law, because it has this European pillar on social rights and Steve Peers, Free trade v freedom of association? The EU/South Korea free trade agreement and the panel report on the EU challenge to South Korean labour law, EU Law Analysis, 26 January 2021 104 Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union [2012] OJ C326, Art. 153 103  46 The UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement: Level Playing Field  it is going to use it; it has shown signs of using it. The most interesting provision coming out under that is on minimum wage. It is not actually setting a minimum wage, but requiring states to think about minimum wages. Will that suggest that there is a disequilibrium, because the EU has this and the UK does not? On the other hand, we would say, “Look, we already have minimum wage legislation, which is regularly reviewed over time”. It is not clear to me quite how these provisions will be triggered, if you think about concrete examples, because, as I have said, in respect of the nonregression, it is quite hard to argue that some smaller changes, significant for employees, will in and of themselves be enough to trigger the threshold of affecting trade or investment, even without the criterion of materiality. 105  Ultimately, these issues will need to be addressed on a case-by-case basis with the potential of resorting to dispute settlement.  6.5 Dispute settlement The level playing field provisions, including those on labour and social standards, are subject to their own separate dispute settlement process. This involves consultation between the parties and, ultimately, the establishment of a panel of experts. As in other EU FTAs, these are relatively weak provisions as the recommendations of the panel are not binding. 106 However, there is one significant difference between the TCA and other EU FTAs. Specifically, Article 410 of the TCA provides that if a panel of experts finds that a party has breached a non-regression provision, and the respondent party has not taken steps to comply with the panel’s report, the complaining party can take “temporary remedies”. As a result, the provisions on non-regression from labour standards has a far stronger enforcement mechanism than in typical FTAs. The provisions on dispute settlement are discussed in more detail in section 8 below.  Committee on the Future Relationship with the European Union, Oral evidence: Progress of the negotiations on the UK’s future relationship with the EU, HC 203, 6 January 2021, Q1169 106 TCA, Article 409(9) 105  47 Commons Library Briefing, 20 May 2021  7. Environment and climate 7.1 Overview On environment and climate change, the TCA provides for both existing environmental standards and climate change measures to be maintained by both sides, together with more specific requirements for different sectors. A central theme of the TCA is the principle of nonregression, which commits both sides to not lowering environmental standards. Both sides compromised somewhat during the negotiations. Whilst both the EU and UK are now free to introduce and enforce their own environmental and climate laws, they must do so in a way that doesn’t gain an advantage in trade or investment. If either party feels a competitive advantage has been gained, they have the option to take rebalancing measures to address this. Both Parties have agreed to continue respecting existing international environmental commitments, including the requirements of the Paris Climate Change Agreement, and to the sharing of information on the ratification, implementation and negotiation of existing or new multilateral environmental agreements.  7.2 The TCA: Definitions and terms Environmental levels of protection Chapter 7 of the TCA covers environment and climate. Article 390 sets out the definition of ‘environmental levels of protection’ as: …the levels of protection provided overall in a Party's law which have the purpose of protecting the environment, including the prevention of a danger to human life or health from environmental impacts, including in each of the following areas: a) b) c) d) e) f) g)  h)  industrial emissions; air emissions and air quality; nature and biodiversity conservation; waste management; the protection and preservation of the aquatic environment; the protection and preservation of the marine environment; the prevention, reduction and elimination of risks to human health or the environment arising from the production, use, release or disposal of chemical substances; or the management of impacts on the environment from agricultural or food production, notably through the use of antibiotics and decontaminants.  Climate level of protection Climate level of protection is defined within the TCA as: …the level of protection with respect to emissions and removals of greenhouse gases and the phase-out of ozone depleting substances. With regard to greenhouse gases, this means: a)  for the Union, the 40 % economy-wide 2030 target, including the Union's system of carbon pricing;  48 The UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement: Level Playing Field  b)  for the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom's economy-wide share of this 2030 target, including the United Kingdom's system of carbon pricing.  Environmental and climate principles Article 393 sets out the Environmental and climate principles of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement. This states that: … each Party commits to respecting the internationally recognised environmental principles to which it has committed, such as in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, adopted at Rio de Janeiro on 14 June 1992 (the "1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development") and in multilateral environmental agreements, including in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, done at New York on 9 May 1992 ("UNFCCC") and the Convention on Biological Diversity, done at Rio de Janeiro on 5 June 1992 (the "Convention on Biological Diversity"), in particular: a)  the principle that environmental protection should be integrated into the making of policies,  b)  including through impact assessments;  c)  the principle of preventative action to avert environmental damage;  d)  the precautionary approach referred to in Article 356 (2);  e)  the principle that environmental damage should as a priority be rectified at source; and  f)  the polluter pays principle.  Box 4: UK Draft Environmental Policy Statement and consultation On 10 March the government published a Draft Environmental Policy Statement and launched a consultation seeking views on it which closes on 2 June 2021. The environmental principles set out in the draft policy statement “operate as a set of overarching principles in the development of all relevant policy with an impact on the environment”. 107 They closely match those set out in the TCA and their meanings are explained in the draft policy statement as follows: • The integration principle is the principle that policy-makers should look for opportunities to embed environmental protection in other fields of policy that have impacts on the environment. It is an overarching objective which is relevant in all circumstances where the legal duty to have due regard to the policy statement applies. • The prevention principle means that government policy should aim to prevent, reduce or mitigate environmental harm. • The rectification at source principle means that if damage to the environment cannot be prevented it should be tackled at its origin. • The polluter pays principle is the principle that those who cause pollution or damage to the environment should be responsible for mitigation or compensation. • The precautionary principle states that where there are threats of serious or irreversible environmental damage, a lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation 108 The policy statement is a statutory document and the Environment Bill requires that “a Minister of the Crown to have ‘due regard’ to this policy statement when making policy”. 109  Defra, Draft Environmental Principles Policy Statement, 10 March 2021 Ibid 109 Ibid 107 108  49 Commons Library Briefing, 20 May 2021  7.3 Trade and sustainable development Article 397 of the TCA sets out the foundations and broad objectives for trade and sustainable development. This is based primarily on the principles of and commitments to international agreements such as the Rio Declaration and the Sustainable Development Goals. Article 397 states that: The Parties recall the Agenda 21 and the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development of 2002, the International Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration on Social Justice for a Fair Globalization, adopted at Geneva on 10 June 2008 by the International Labour Conference at its 97th Session (the "2008 ILO Declaration on Social Justice for a Fair Globalization"), the Outcome Document of the UN Conference on Sustainable Development of 2012 entitled "The Future We Want", endorsed by the UN General Assembly Resolution 66/288 adopted on 27 July 2012, and the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by the UN General Assembly Resolution 70/1 on 25 September 2015 and its Sustainable Development Goals. In light of paragraph 1 of this Article, the objective of this Chapter is to enhance the integration of sustainable development, notably its labour and environmental dimensions, in the Parties' trade and investment relationship and in this respect to complement the commitments of the Parties under Chapters 6 and 7. 110  Article 400 sets out the commitment of both Parties to implementing multilateral environmental agreements: The Parties recognise the importance of the UN Environment Assembly of the UN Environment Programme and of multilateral environmental governance and agreements as a response of the international community to global or regional environmental challenges and stress the need to enhance the mutual supportiveness between trade and environment policies, rules and measures. 111  To facilitate this commitment, the TCA requires both Parties to regularly exchange information on aspects of the ratification, implementation and negotiation of existing or new multilateral environmental agreements. Subsequent articles in the TCA (401 to 406) set out the commitment of both Parties to international agreements in relation to specific areas of trade and sustainability. These are arranged under the following headings: •  Article 401 - Trade and climate change  •  Article 402 - Trade and biological diversity  •  Article 403 - Trade and forests  •  Article 404 - Trade and sustainable management of marine biological resources and aquaculture  110 111  TCA, Art. 397 TCA, Art. 400  50 The UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement: Level Playing Field  •  Article 405 – Trade and investment favouring sustainable development  •  Article 406 - Trade and responsible supply chain management  7.4 Non-regression from levels of protection During the negotiations the EU wanted the UK to ensure its laws matched EU environmental legislation. It pushed for “dynamic alignment” with a “ratchet clause” whereby if one party raised its environmental standards the other party could not then drop below this new minimum level. The UK however argued that as it was no longer part of the EU and unable to influence EU regulations it should have freedom to legislate independently. The final TCA allows each party “to determine the environmental levels of protection and climate level of protection it deems appropriate and to adopt or modify its law and policies in a manner consistent with each Party's international commitments”. 112 However, the TCA also aims to prevent either party weakening environmental legislation below the levels in place at the end of the transition period. Article 391 of the TCA states that: A Party shall not weaken or reduce, in a manner affecting trade or investment between the Parties, its environmental levels of protection or its climate level of protection below the levels that are in place at the end of the transition period, including by failing to effectively enforce its environmental law or climate level of protection. 113  The TCA also states that the individual parties are able to make discretionary choices over the allocation of resources for ensuring levels of environmental protection are maintained. The Parties recognise that each Party retains the right to exercise reasonable discretion and to make bona fide decisions regarding the allocation of environmental enforcement resources with respect to other environmental law and climate policies determined to have higher priorities, provided that the exercise of that discretion, and those decisions, are not inconsistent with its obligations under this Chapter. 114  In addition to the principle of non-regression, Article 391 of the TCA also encourages both parties to increase levels of environmental and climate protection. This states that: The Parties shall continue to strive to increase their respective environmental levels of protection or their respective climate level of protection referred to in this Chapter. 115  7.5 Enforcement The TCA sets out how each party should enforce its relevant environmental and climate legislation. Article 394 states that:  TCA, Art. 391 (1) TCA, Art. 391 (2) 114 TCA, Art. 391 (3) 115 TCA, Art. 391 (5) 112 113  51 Commons Library Briefing, 20 May 2021  For the purposes of enforcement as referred to in Article 391, each Party shall, in accordance with its law, ensure that: a)  b)  domestic authorities competent to enforce the relevant law with regard to environment and climate give due consideration to alleged violations of such law that come to their attention; those authorities shall have adequate and effective remedies available to them, including injunctive relief as well as proportionate and dissuasive sanctions, if appropriate; and national administrative or judicial proceedings are available to natural and legal persons with a sufficient interest to bring actions against violations of such law and to seek effective remedies, including injunctive relief, and that the proceedings are not prohibitively costly and are conducted in a fair, equitable and transparent way. 116  The establishment of the Office for Environmental Protection (OEP) under the Environment Bill will fill the enforcement gap left by the UK’s departure from the EU. The OEP will “provide scrutiny and advice on the implementation of environment law and will receive and investigate complaints on alleged breaches of environment law by public authorities, with the ability to take legal action in serious cases”. 117 However, delays to the Environment Bill’s passage through Parliament have prevented the OEP from being fully established. The OEP will have a statutory role in England and in Northern Ireland, subject to the approval of the Northern Ireland Assembly. In Scotland, Environmental Standards Scotland will fulfil this role and the Welsh Government plans to install an independent commissioner to carry out a similar role. Further information on the Environment Bill and the establishment of the OEP is in the Commons Library briefing 9119 covering the Committee and Remaining stages in the Commons. The TCA requires that the enforcement bodies of the UK must regularly meet with the European Commission to cooperate on monitoring and enforcement of Environmental and Climate law. However, the frequency with which these meetings must occur is not specifically mentioned in the agreement. The Parties shall ensure that the European Commission and the supervisory bodies of the United Kingdom regularly meet with each other and co-operate on the effective monitoring and enforcement of the law with regard to environment and climate as referred to in Article 391. 118  7.6 Rebalancing Rebalancing measures set out in Article 411 of the TCA are designed to prevent either side gaining an advantage in trade or investment if the other party introduces higher standards of environmental or climate protections. While recognising the right of each party to determine its future priorities with respect to environmental or climate protection, TCA, Art. 394 HL European Union Committee, Beyond Brexit: food, environment, energy and health, HL 247, 23 March 2021 118 TCA, Art. 395 116 117  52 The UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement: Level Playing Field  Article 411 provides that if future divergences between UK and EU standards causes “material impacts on trade and investment between the parties”, the parties can take “rebalancing measures”, which can include trade remedies. For further detail see section 8.5 below.  7.7 Issues and commentary EU Environment Sub-Committee Inquiry On 23 March 2021, the House of Lords EU Environment Sub-Committee (part of the European Union Committee) published Beyond Brexit: food, environment, energy and health. This report followed an inquiry into the provisions in the TCA and looked at any challenges that could arise, how to resolve them an where UK-EU relations should progress from here. As part of the inquiry, the EU Environment Sub-Committee took evidence from a range of organisations in the fields of agriculture and food, fishing, environment and climate change, energy, chemicals, and health. Some of the key information from the inquiry and analysis from additional sources is set out below. Enforcement In written evidence to the EU Committee, Greener UK, a coalition of 12 major environmental organisations, questioned the enforceability of the environmental provisions in the TCA stating that: …the majority of the environmental provisions are not enforceable and while sanctions are available in relation to disputes about non-regression, the value of this is limited by the narrow focus on trade and investment impact. 119  Greener UK went on to criticise the dispute mechanisms for dealing with environmental disputes stating that neither the environment nor trade and sustainable development were covered by the full dispute mechanism. Dispute settlement is covered in more detail in section 8 below however the comments from Greener UK stated that: For environment-related provisions to have a real impact, they must be supported by well-designed and effective governance mechanisms that enable meaningful enforcement where appropriate. However, the full horizontal dispute settlement mechanism applying to the core of the TCA does not apply to the environment or trade and sustainable development chapters. Instead, the agreement provides for a weaker mechanism involving consultations between the parties and the convening of a panel of experts. 120  The House of Lords European Union Committee expressed similar concerns over the enforceability of some of the provisions in the TCA stating that: We are glad that the Government and the EU were able to find compromises on the environment and climate change Chapter of the TCA, though we share the concerns voiced by witnesses about the enforceability of some provisions. 121 Written evidence from Greener UK (EEH0030) Written evidence from Greener UK (EEH0030) 121 HL European Union Committee, Beyond Brexit: food, environment, energy and health, HL 247, 23 March 2021 119 120  53 Commons Library Briefing, 20 May 2021  Non-regression In giving evidence to the European Union Committee, Greener UK outlined its disappointment at the inclusion of a trade and investment test when assessing any weakening of environmental and climate standards. However, the group also welcomed the fact that it provided a stronger enforcement mechanism than other areas of the TCA. The inclusion of a trade and investment test is disappointing – providing proof of damaging economic impacts on the other party will be difficult and potentially a protracted undertaking. It is therefore not clear to what extent this provision will act as an effective safeguard against lower standards in the future. A nonregression mechanism that was broader in scope and applied irrespective of possible impacts on trade or investment should have been included in the TCA. However, it is welcome that the provision has a better enforcement mechanism attached, compared to the rest of the environment and sustainable development chapters. Either party can take action via temporary remedies if the other party does not conform to the assessment of a panel of experts in relation to a dispute. 122  Brexit and the environment, a website funded by the Economic and Social Research Councill, provides analysis and commentary on how Brexit affects the environment. A recent article highlighted limitations in the non-regression elements of the TCA: Whilst the TCA concluded between the UK and EU does include non-regression and environmental progression, it does so in a limited way. For example, the commitment to non-regression is a limited environmental policy with direct trade and investment implications. The 2019 Political Declaration that the EU and the UK signed committed both sides to establish ‘appropriate mechanisms’’ to ensure environmental policy is adequately implemented and enforced. However, the UK Government was eventually forced to concede that the OEP – will not be fully up and running until at least the second half of 2021. In January 2021, the environment ministry (DEFRA) announced that because of COVID-19, the Bill would not receive Royal Assent until the Autumn. Even if it is adopted by 1 January 2022 (by then it would be a year late), environmental groups remain fearful that it will not be sufficiently independent to hold the Government fully to account. 123  Devolved Policy The environment is a devolved policy competence and as such concern has been raised by some analysts from Brexit & Environment over whether there will be a UK-wide level playing field and whether different UK nations will want to or be able to have different environmental standards to each other: …the Environment Bill is mainly England facing, leaving Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland scope to develop their own bespoke systems. The Scottish Government has expressed its determination to dynamically align with EU rules. However, the highly contentious Internal Market Bill, which seeks to create a new UK122 123  Written evidence from Greener UK (EEH0030) Brexit & Environment, Environmental Regulation in the Post-Brexit Era, 23 March 2021  54 The UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement: Level Playing Field  wide level playing field, may limit the freedom of action of the devolved nations. They have voiced their fear that the rules of the largest market, England, will drive standards across the whole of the UK. 124  The same concern was also raised by Colin T. Reid, professor of Law at the University of Dundee who gave evidence to the European Union Committee and stated that it represented a major challenge: There is a major challenge created by the UK Government agreeing such a far-reaching Agreement when responsibility for many of the matters covered lies in the hands of the devolved administrations. 125  On 31 December 2020 the Scottish Government published an early assessment of what the outcome of the EU-UK negotiations means for Scotland. Commenting on the impact of UK’s deal on Scotland, the Scottish Government stated its intention to remain aligned with EU rules where possible but highlighted the potential threat to environmental protections posed by the Internal Market Act 2020. Scotland is committed to maintaining high environmental standards through the UK Withdrawal from the European Union (Continuity) (Scotland) Bill, and intends to stay aligned with EU rules where possible and practicable to do so. However, protections risk being impaired by both the loss of participation in EU frameworks, systems and collaborative programmes, and by the threat to devolved competency in these areas posed by the United Kingdom Internal Market Act 2020. 126  The Welsh Government has also expressed concerns about the complexity of certain aspects of the TCA. On 12 February 2021 (updated 11 March 2021) it published ‘The new relationship with the EU: What it means for Wales’ which examined the implications of the TCA for citizens, business, and communities in Wales. The section of the report covering ‘Labour and Environmental Rights’ questioned how the non-regression principle of the TCA would work and be enforced in practise, stating that: The intention is to eliminate any possible competitive advantage by either party through a reduction in the costs of production as a result of such changes. As a concept, it has precedents in other trade agreements. However, the nature of the high and complex regulatory standards of the EU Single Market, combined with the very large volume of existing EU-UK trade in goods, including integrated crossborder supply chains, makes this a particularly difficult issue to address. It is not immediately clear how this will operate in practice or how it will be enforced. The TCA provides for further work between the EU and the UK to oversee this issue. In any event, the legal nature and enforcement of these issues is now of a more complex nature. The precise nature of legal obligations in either jurisdiction may diverge over time. This could cause a lack of clarity and ultimately discrepancies, in interpreting issues such as social and environmental rights.  Brexit & Environment, Environmental Regulation in the Post-Brexit Era, 23 March 2021 125 Written evidence from Prof Colin Reid (EEH0004) 126 Gov.scot, EU-UK negotiations: outcome analysis, 31 December 2020 124  55 Commons Library Briefing, 20 May 2021  In any event, the whole TCA has an inherent vulnerability because of this. It provides for so-called “rebalancing”, when either party believes that regulatory changes have led to divergence in a manner that gives one party a competitive advantage in trade or investment. This could lead to either party taking remedial action to address such imbalances, pending their review by an independent arbitration panel; and could ultimately lead to the termination of the trade provisions in the TCA. 127  The House of Lords European Union Committee has also recognised the potential policy implications of the TCA for the devolved nations and has urged the government to fully address them as soon as possible: The TCA negotiated by the Government will affect the policy choices available to devolved administrations and legislatures in areas of devolved competence including the environment. There are already diverging environment and climate change goals across the UK, which could indicate challenges ahead. We urge the Government to address any concerns raised by the devolved administrations regarding the TCA’s environment and climate change provisions - via the Common Frameworks programme or other routes - as fully and promptly as possible. 128  Rebalancing The rebalancing measures in the TCA were welcomed by a number of witnesses giving evidence to the House of Lords European Union Committee. However, several witnesses questioned how the rebalancing measures would be implemented in practise. Greener UK commented that: This process [rebalancing] should be a useful tool given much greater environmental ambition will be needed in the coming years, although the effectiveness of this novel mechanism remains to be seen. It is not yet clear how provisions such as rebalancing will work in practice … Early cases will be important in determining how terms are interpreted—for example, it will be for the arbitration tribunal to decide what is a material impact, significant divergence and reliable evidence. 129  The European Union Committee welcomed the inclusion of rebalancing measures in the TCA citing the UK’s leading role in climate change policies as an example of where a competitive advantage might be gained by the EU: We welcome the fact that the rebalancing measures help mitigate the threat of competitive disadvantage that could otherwise have limited the Parties’ ambitions on environment and climate change protections. There are policies—especially in relation to climate change—where the UK’s progress exceeds the EU’s. 130  Gov.wales, The new relationship with the EU: What it means for Wales, 12 February 2021 128 HL European Union Committee, Beyond Brexit: food, environment, energy and health, HL 247, 23 March 2021 p37 129 Written evidence from Greener UK (EEH0030) 130 HL European Union Committee, Beyond Brexit: food, environment, energy and health, 23 March 2021, p37 127  56 The UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement: Level Playing Field  Environmental Principles The Environmental Principles set out by the government to replace those set out in EU treaties and law have received some criticism from the independent think tank Green Alliance. Writing for the think tank, Professor Maria Lee highlighted that UK faces “a necessarily complex legal situation, with a maze of retained provisions and inherited case law within which the principles will need to operate”. She also “emphasised that this new legislation does not enforce the principles systemically or in the same legally binding way as the previous EU framework. They will apply only at a high level and ministers only need to pay them ‘due regard’.” 131 Further analysis from contributors to the Green Alliance blog were also set out: Professor Eloise Scotford of UCL described in greater detail the draft policy statement emphasising the scale of the challenge that Defra faces, given the multi-faceted nature of the principles and the multiple functions they serve. She said there was an unanswered need for the principles to influence thinking right from the earliest inception of a policy, not just to be bolted onto the end of the process. David Wolfe QC offered the benefit of his experience within the courts, in interpreting and applying the public sector equality duty. He noted that the Environment Bill set up the principles as process obligations for policy making in a similar way, but both the legislation and the policy statement lack the same clarity and strength of the equality duty. 132  7.8 Climate change The TCA sets out a range of principles covering the level playing field and environment, including climate change, as set out above. There are also some provisions and language that are specific to climate change, both in the area of non-regression and future collaboration. The European Commission’s Q&A document on the TCA called the provisions included on climate change “an ambitions framework for cooperation”: The Agreement also establishes an ambitious framework for cooperation in the fight against climate change, as well as provisions for cooperation in the development of offshore energy, with a clear focus on the North Sea. 133  The Summary document published by the UK Government in December 2020, does not refer to the framework but does highlight the high standards on climate change (and environment) embedded in the TCA: The Government has embedded into this Agreement our manifesto commitment to high labour environment and climate standards without giving the EU any say over our rules. 134  Green Alliance, The government is on the brink of making a mistake over environmental principles, 30 April 2021 132 Green Alliance, The government is on the brink of making a mistake over environmental principles, 30 April 2021 133 European Commission, Q&A: EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, 24 December 2020 134 Gov.uk, UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement Summary, 24 December 2020 131  57 Commons Library Briefing, 20 May 2021  The TCA refers to climate change as “an existential threat to humanity”. Article 764 (the fight against climate change), under the heading setting out the basis for cooperation between the parties. It also commits both Parties to uphold the Paris Agreement and do nothing to “materially defeat the object and purpose” of the Paris Agreement. Specific provisions related to climate change include Article 392 on carbon pricing which requires both parties to have an effective carbon pricing scheme in place, covering certain sectors. It also requires existing levels of coverage to be maintained, as set out in Article 391 on nonregression. Article 401 on trade and climate change (under the trade and sustainable development heading) states support for the Paris Agreement, including reference to the ambition to keep global temperature increases below 1.5oC, and sets a basis for trade that supports a green transition: (a) commits to effectively implementing the UNFCCC, and the Paris Agreement of which one principal aim is strengthening the global response to climate change and holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 ºC above preindustrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1,5 ºC above pre-industrial levels; (b) shall promote the mutual supportiveness of trade and climate policies and measures thereby contributing to the transition to a low greenhouse gas emission, resource-efficient economy and to climate-resilient development; and (c) shall facilitate the removal of obstacles to trade and investment in goods and services of particular relevance for climate change mitigation and adaptation, such as renewable energy, energy efficient products and services, for instance through addressing tariff and non-tariff barriers or through the adoption of policy frameworks conducive to the deployment of the best available solutions. 135  Climate change is also listed in Article 770 on global cooperation on issues of shared economic, environmental and social interest which states that “parties shall endeavour to cooperate on current and emerging global issues of common interest”. The TCA also refers in several places to areas to support the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Article 319 and 320 specifically provide for the promotion and support of renewable energy. Article 367 (14) refers to subsidies that are allowed subject to conditions, if aimed at “delivering a secure, affordable and sustainable energy system and a well-functioning and competitive energy market or increasing the level of environmental protection”.  Commentary An article by UK in a Changing Europe, The EU-UK Agreement is the first to make climate change a make or break issue, published 25 January 2021 considers the language on climate change in the TCA is “one of the strongest in any trade agreement”: 135  TCA, Art. 401 (2)  58 The UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement: Level Playing Field  Among the most important provisions is Article [764], which declares the fight against climate change as a one of the bases for cooperation, alongside democracy, the rule of law, human rights and the non-proliferation of WMDs. Further, Article [771] affirms that Article [764(1)] is an ‘essential element’ of the partnership established by the TCA as well as ‘any supplementing agreement.’ Essential elements are important when determining suspension or termination of a treaty in international law under the law of treaties. This language is one of the strongest found in any trade agreement, declaring that ‘climate change represents an existential threat to humanity’. 136  The article also highlights the requirement for both parties to have effective carbon pricing in place: Article [392] obliges both parties to ‘have in place an effective system of carbon pricing’ and suggests that they give serious thought on linking their respective carbon pricing systems to preserve the system’s integrity and possibly increase its effectiveness and avoids major differences with Northern Ireland which will still apply the emissions trading scheme for some sectors under the Withdrawal Agreement. 137  Analysis by Chris Papanicolaou of law firm JonesDay of the climate change provisions in the TCA, focused on implications for business, concluded that a movement away from net zero commitments by both Parties was unlikely given the provisions included in the TCA: The TCA includes tools and mechanisms for the enforcement of the level playing field commitments, including the ability of either party to impose duties unilaterally, subject to review by an arbitration panel, where a change creates a significant negative effect on trade or investment between the EU and the UK. If such measures are used too frequently, either side can trigger a review of these provisions and the trade aspects of the TCA more broadly, aiming to end with a different balance of rights and obligations. As an international treaty, the TCA does not give businesses the direct right to challenge a party's noncompliance. Equally, divergence from the commitments only becomes an issue where the impact distorts trade and investment between the parties. In the short term, it is difficult to assess the immediate impact on businesses in the context of environmental and climate change regulation, but a move by either the EU or UK away from rules designed to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 is unlikely, given the express provisions of the TCA designed to prevent this. 138  The Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), in its analysis of the TCA supported this view and predicted the commitments to net-zero in the Agreement set a precedent for their inclusion in future trade deals:  UK in a Changing Europe, The EU-UK Agreement is the first to make climate change a make or break issue, 25 January 2021 137 Ibid 138 Chris Papanicolaou, Climate Change Provisions of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, 3 March 2021 136  59 Commons Library Briefing, 20 May 2021  For the first time in a trade agreement, and perhaps setting a precedent for future deals for example with the US and China, the net zero carbon emissions by 2050 target is embedded within the text. Specifically, the phrase ‘each party reaffirms its ambition of achieving economy-wide climate neutrality by 2050’ has many climate experts singing the praises of the deal, as a regression – going back on the net zero goal – could now result in the TCA being terminated, suspended or presumably causing tariffs to be imposed between the two trading blocs. It therefore appears that climate change and net zero is now a make-or-break issue for the success of the deal. 139  Greener UK concluded about the agreement overall that it has “the potential to be dynamic and adjust over time to reflect new cooperative arrangements between the UK and EU”. On climate change specifically it welcomed the provisions but expressed concern about the threshold for proof of any breach: The fight against climate change is explicitly specified in Article [771] as constituting an ‘essential element’ of the agreement. Furthermore, 'materially defeating the object and purpose of the Paris Agreement’ is explicitly specified in Article [772] as constituting a serious and substantial failure to fulfil an essential element of this agreement. This is a very welcome provision, and means any serious breach can lead to the suspension or termination of all or parts of the agreement. However, we note that the threshold of demonstrating that a party has defeated the object and purpose of the agreement may be a high threshold to meet. 140  The ECIU also highlighted that the TCA did not set out what would constitute a breach of the agreement on climate grounds: Actions that would constitute a breach of the deal in terms of climate change are not explicit in the TCA’s text. Although Marley Morris, an expert that recently published a report on the Brexit deal, explains that to be directly in breach of the TCA, there would have to be a renouncement of the Paris Agreement from one side, or clarity that one party is not delivering. 141  For further detailed analysis, Carbon Brief produced a detailed Q&A on the negotiations and the TCA in January 2021, which is available on their website.

Dispute settlement 8.1 The general governance and dispute settlement mechanisms Governance provisions for the TCA and supplementing agreements are set out in Title III of Part One of the Agreement. This includes a UK-EU Partnership Council to supervise the operation of the Agreement at a political level, providing strategic direction chaired by a UK Government Minister and European Commissioner. 142 Decisions will be taken by mutual consent and will be binding on the two parties. Either party can refer any issue relating to the implementation or interpretation of the TCA and supplementing agreements to the Partnership Council. It will have the power to adopt decisions and recommendations in relation to the application of the Agreement. The Partnership Council is supported by a set of committees. These include a Trade Partnership Committee covering the trade aspects of the TCA. This in turn is supported by several Specialised Committees including the Specialised Committee on Level Playing Field for Open and Fair Competition. Title I, Part Six of the TCA set out mechanisms for “avoiding and settling disputes” between the parties in relation to interpretation and application of the TCA and supplementing agreements. This involves recourse to an independent arbitration tribunal if consultations between the two parties fail to reach a solution. These provisions are similar to those found in other international agreements, including the WTO agreement. The arbitration tribunal consists of a UK nominee, an EU nominee and a jointly agreed chair, drawn from a list of potential arbitrators established by the Partnership Council. All arbitrators need to be independent of the EU and Member States’ and UK Governments. Where one party feels that the other party is in breach of the TCA it can request consultations. These can take place in the Partnership Council or Specialised Committee. If the matter is not resolved within 30 days, the two parties can extend the consultation period or refer it to an arbitration tribunal. The tribunal has up to 160 days to make a ruling. Various timelines are set out in Part Six, although these are halved where the tribunal agrees that the matter is urgent. Certain parts of the TCA are exempted from these provisions but they apply to most of Part Two (trade, transport, fisheries and other arrangements). In cases of non-compliance with an arbitration tribunal hearing, certain treaty obligations can be suspended. This includes the possibility of cross-retaliation in certain parts of Part Two of the TCA, so that treaty obligations could be suspended in one area for a breach of obligations in another part of Part Two. Any such suspension must be proportionate and appropriate and can be challenged before an arbitration tribunal. 142  The UK has appointed Lord Frost, Minister of State in the Cabinet Office, as its cochair in the Partnership Council. The EU co-chair is Vice-President of the European Commission Maroš Šefčovič.  61 Commons Library Briefing, 20 May 2021  The suspension should be withdrawn if the responding party then complies with the initial ruling. The tribunal can be asked to rule on whether compliance has been achieved. Unlike the Withdrawal Agreement there is no role for the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) in the dispute settlement provisions. The CJEU provides binding interpretations of questions EU law to arbitration panels in the WA dispute settlement process, where a matter raises such questions. The EU sought a similar role for the CJEU in the TCA, but this was opposed by the UK. Provisions of the TCA will be interpreted in line with public international law including the Vienna Convention on the Law on Treaties 1969.  8.2 Exceptions and Bespoke Provisions for the Level playing field Article 735 (2) sets out exceptions to the Part Six dispute settlement provisions. These include the following provisions in the level playing field title (Title XI of Heading One of Part Two): •  Article 355(1), (2) and (4), setting out general principles and objectives in the general provisions of the level playing field title (see section 1.2)  •  Article 356(1) and (3) covering right to regulate, precautionary approach and scientific and technical information in the general provisions (see section 7.2 above)  •  Chapter 2 (Competition Policy) (see section 2.2 above)  •  Article 371 (which provides that both parties establish an operationally independent authority with an appropriate role in its subsidy control regime) and Article 372 (which provides for domestic courts to hear claims, review decisions and grant remedies in Chapter 3 (subsidy control) (see sections 3.4 and 3.5 above)  •  Chapter 5 (Taxation) (see section 5.2 above), and  •  Article 411(4) to (9) in Chapter 9 (horizontal and institutional provisions) which enables either party to request a review of the trade heading (Heading One of Part Two) and for the parties to add other headings to the review. This is described further in section 8.6.  8.3 Panel of Experts for Labour, environment and climate, sustainable development Chapter 6 (labour and social standards), chapter 7 (environment and climate) and chapter 8 (other instruments for trade and sustainable development) of Title XI have derogations from the Part Six dispute settlement provisions although these are not specified under Article 735 (2). For each of these chapters, provisions for consultation (Article 408) and for a panel of experts rather than an arbitration tribunal (Article 409) are set out under chapter 9 (horizontal and institutional provisions) of Title XI.  62 The UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement: Level Playing Field  Article 408 provides that a party may request consultations with the other regarding any matter arising under Article 355 (3) in chapter 1 (the mutual commitment to climate neutrality by 2050) and chapters 6, 7 and 8. Consultations have to begin within 30 days of the request with the aim of reaching a mutually satisfactory resolution of the matter. Article 409 provides that where consultations do not reach a satisfactory resolution, a party may request that a panel of experts be convened to examine that matter. This can be done 90 days after the original request for consultations. This is longer than the minimum 30 day consultation period in the Part Six dispute settlement mechanism. The panel of experts will be established and operate in a similar way to the arbitration tribunal outlined in the Part Six mechanism. It will be composed of three panellists. These will be selected from a list of at least 15 individuals established by The Trade Specialised Committee on the Level Playing Field at its first meeting after the entry into force of the TCA. 143 The list will consist of at least five nominations from each party and five individuals able to serve as chair. The list of potential chairs will not include nationals of either party. The experts will have specialised knowledge of the fields covered by these chapters, or in international dispute resolution, and meet similar criteria for independence from either party as the arbitration tribunal members. The panel can seek information from other international bodies and experts where relevant (for example from the International Labour Organization or other relevant bodies). It will issue an interim report setting out findings within 100 days of its establishment. This can be extended to up to 125 days if the panel notifies the parties that it cannot meet the 100 day deadline. The parties can request that the panel of experts review particular aspects of the report within 25 days of its delivery. If there is no request to review, then the interim report becomes the final report. If there is a review, then the panel of experts needs to deliver a final report within 175 days of its initial establishment. This can be extended to up to 195 days if the chair notifies the parties that the earlier deadline cannot be met. These timelines are longer than those set out in Part Six, Title One for arbitration tribunals. The deliberations of tribunals can be extended to a maximum of 160 days. The final report of the Panel of Experts will be made public. The interim and final reports will set out the findings of fact and whether the responding party has complied with its obligations, together with reasoning behind the findings. Article 409 (19) provides that provisions of Title I of Part Six, relating to the establishment and workings of the arbitration tribunals, will apply to the work of the panel of experts unless otherwise provided by the Article. 143  Following a period of provisional application, the TCA fully entered into force on 1 May 2021. The various bodies set up in the Part One governance provisions had not met during the period of provisional application, but were expected to become fully operational once the TCA was fully applied.  63 Commons Library Briefing, 20 May 2021  Panel recommendations and compliance Article 409 (9) states that the parties “share the understanding that if the Panel makes recommendations in its report, the respondent party does not need to follow these recommendations in ensuring conformity with the Agreement”. This contrasts with Article 754 relating to the arbitration tribunal’s rulings which “shall be binding” on the EU and UK. Subsequent paragraphs in Article 409 nevertheless provide for further recourse to the panel of experts where the parties disagree on how the responding party should conform with its obligations. Under Article 410, the complaining party can then revert to the Part Six provisions for temporary remedies (including suspension of obligations) where the responding party does not comply with obligations. 144 Article 409 (16) provides that if the final report of the panel determines that a party has not conformed with its obligations under the relevant chapter, the parties shall, within 90 days of the delivery of the final report, discuss appropriate measures to be implemented. The respondent party has to inform the complaining party, and its domestic advisory groups, within 105 days of the report being delivered of its decision on any measures to be implemented. Article 409 (18) provides that where the parties disagree on measures to be taken the complaining party may request that the panel of experts decide on the matter. The panel of experts will deliver its findings within 45 days of this request. Article 410 provides that the provisions for temporary remedies (Article 749) and for review of measures to comply with temporary remedies (Article 750) as set out in Part Six will apply (mutatis mutandis) 145 to disputes in Chapter 6 (labour and social standards) and Chapter 7 (environment and climate). Furthermore it states that the parties recognise that the remedies (including suspension of obligations and potentially cross-retaliation) authorised under Article 749 are available to the complaining party where the responding party does not conform with the report of the panel of experts. Article 749 and 750 are explained in more detail below.  Cross-retaliation for non-compliance Under Article 749 a complaining party may suspend certain provisions of the Agreement if a respondent party does not comply with an arbitration tribunal. The complaining party also has the option of requesting “temporary compensation”. It can then suspend obligations under the Agreement where there is no agreement between the two parties on what the compensation should be. It can also decide not to  The Government’s summary explainer on the TCA explains the Article as “tailored provisions” in relation to which “(a)ny recommendations made by the Panel of Experts are not binding on the Parties”. 145 Article 410 (2) states that Articles 749 and 750 shall apply mutatis mutandis. Mutatis mutandis can be understood as meaning with the necessary changes having been made or with consideration of the respective differences. 144  64 The UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement: Level Playing Field  request compensation and instead notify the responding party that it is suspending treaty obligations. The notification shall specify the level of intended suspension of obligation. This can involve cross-retaliation across the trade, aviation, road transport and fisheries headings of Part Two, although retaliation should initially be considered within the same heading. Article 749 (6) states that if the arbitration tribunal has ruled that there has been a violation in Heading One (trade) or Heading Three (road transport) of Part Two, the suspension may be applied in another title of the same heading “in particular if the complaining party is of the view that such suspension is effective in inducing compliance”. Furthermore Article 749 (8) provides that in Heading One (trade), Heading Two (aviation), Heading Three (road transport) or Heading Five (fisheries) of Part Two: if the complaining party considers that it is not practicable or effective to suspend obligations within the same Heading as that in which the arbitration tribunal has found the violation, and that the circumstances are serious enough, it may seek to suspend obligations under other covered provisions.  The complaining party needs to state the reasons for its decision. The suspension of obligations can commence 10 days after the complaining party has sent the notification of intended suspension. Certain parts of the Agreement cannot be suspended under this Article. These are those parts of the TCA not covered by the Part Six provisions (for example the Part Three law enforcement and judicial cooperation provisions) and the social security coordination provisions. Suspension of obligations in relation to EU programmes or financial services commitments can only be applied in relation to disputes under those provisions (cross-retaliation does not apply). 146 Arbitration on suspension of obligations The suspension of obligations “shall not exceed the level equivalent to the nullification or impairment caused by the violation”. If the respondent party considers that the notified level of suspension of obligations exceeds this level or that any proposed cross-suspension under the aviation heading or across the different headings identified in does not meet the principles or follow the procedures allowing for such cross-suspension then it can request an arbitration tribunal ruling on the matter. This needs to be done within the 10 day period following notification of the intended suspension. The arbitration tribunal will deliver its decision on this within 30 days. Obligations cannot be suspended until the arbitration tribunal has delivered its decision (Article 749 (11)). The arbitration tribunal will rule on whether the intended suspension of obligations meets the equivalence criteria and, where applicable, the principles and procedures allowing for cross-suspension (Article 749 146  See sections 4.2 and 4.3 of Commons Library briefing 9139, The UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement: governance and dispute settlement for more detail.  65 Commons Library Briefing, 20 May 2021  (12)). Its decision will be final, and suspension of obligations shall be consistent with the decision. This may require the complaining party to adjust its proposed suspension measures. Compliance following temporary remedies The suspension of obligations or the compensation initially referred to is intended to be temporary. They will apply until one of the following occurs: •  the parties have “reached a mutually agreed solution”  •  the parties have agreed that a measure taken brings the respondent party into compliance with the covered provisions, or  •  relevant measures have been withdrawn or amended in order to bring the respondent party into compliance (Article 749 (13)).  Article 750 provides for review of measures taken to comply after the adoption of temporary remedies. Where a respondent party has taken measures to comply following the suspension of obligations or application of temporary compensation, it needs to notify the complaining party. The complaining party will then terminate the suspension of obligations within 30 days. It may also terminate the application of compensation. However, if the parties do not reach agreement on whether compliance has been achieved within 30 days of the responding party notifying that is has taken the measures to comply, then the complaining party will request a decision from the arbitration tribunal on this. The tribunal will deliver its decision on this within 46 days of this request. If the tribunal finds that compliance has been achieved, then the suspension of obligations or compensation shall be terminated. The level of suspension of obligations or of compensation can also be adjusted in light of the tribunal decision.  8.4 Provisions for subsidies As described in further detail in section 3.6 above, the Agreement contains some bespoke provisions to address any disputes on subsidies. Disputes about compliance with the requirements may be addressed by consultation (Article 370) or engaging the Trade Specialised Committee on Level Playing Field. In addition, the Article 374 dispute settlement mechanism allows for temporary unilateral remedies taken in response to individual subsidies which have a significant negative effect on UK-EU trade and investment. These remedies are subject to arbitration. The related Article 411 rebalancing and review mechanisms described in the following sections also apply.  8.5 Rebalancing mechanism The key to resolving differences between the UK and EU over the enforcement of commitments on the level playing field was the rebalancing mechanism.  66 The UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement: Level Playing Field  Agreement on this mechanism While other governance and dispute settlement provisions in the TCA can be compared to those found in other trade agreements, Dr Holger Hestermeyer has described the rebalancing mechanism as “utterly novel and remarkable”. 147 In her press conference announcing the TCA, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that the agreed level playing field measures would mean “the EU´s rules and standards will be respected” and it would “have effective tools to react if fair competition is distorted and impacts our trade”. 148 Article 411 (1) to (3) sets out the mechanism. It recognises the right of either party to determine their own future policies in relation to labour, environmental and climate protection and subsidy control (Article 411 (1)). But it provides for a mechanism for either party to take “appropriate rebalancing measures” if there are “material impacts” on trade or investment between the parties arising as a result of significant divergences between the parties in these areas (Article 411 (2)). These measures should be restricted in scope and duration to “what is strictly necessary and proportionate in order to remedy the situation” with priority given to measures that least disturb the functioning of the Agreement. Where a party wishes to impose a rebalancing measure, the following procedure set out in Article 411 (3) applies: a.  The concerned party notifies the other party through the Partnership Council of the rebalancing measures it intends to take, providing all relevant information. Consultations then commence and are deemed concluded within 14 days from the notification.  b.  If no mutually acceptable solution is found, the concerned party may adopt rebalancing measures no sooner than five days from the conclusion of the consultations, unless the notified party requests the establishment of an arbitration tribunal within the same five day period. This would be based on the Part Six dispute settlement provisions for establishment of a tribunal, but Article 760 which sets out a bespoke expedited process for establishing an arbitration tribunal for the purposes of Article 374 (remedial measures in the subsidy control chapter) and Article 411 applies here. This includes a two day period to appoint a tribunal, and a further two day period deadline to hold its first meeting (rather than seven) and a seven day deadline for the complaining party to submit its case (rather than 20). 149  See HL European Union Committee, Uncorrected oral evidence: Future UK-EU relations: governance, 2 February 2021, Q8 148 See also European Commission Press release, 24 December 2020 149 See Commons Library briefing 9139, The UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement: governance and dispute settlement, section 4.4 147  67 Commons Library Briefing, 20 May 2021  c.  The tribunal shall deliver its final ruling within 30 days of its establishment. If it does not deliver its final ruling within this time period, the concerned party may adopt the rebalancing measures from three days after the expiry of the 30 day period. The other party can then take proportionate countermeasures until the tribunal delivers its ruling. Priority shall be given to such countermeasures as will least disturb the functioning of this Agreement.  d.  Where the arbitration tribunal finds that the rebalancing measure by the concerned party is consistent with the “material impact” criteria set out in Article 411 (2), then the concerned party can adopt the rebalancing measure.  e.  If the arbitration tribunal has found the rebalancing measures to be inconsistent with the “material impact” criteria, then the concerned party will need to withdraw or adjust its proposed measure and notify the other party what it intends to do within three days.  In relation to compliance or non-compliance with the tribunal ruling, relevant articles of the Part Six dispute settlement provisions apply in the same way. These are: •  Article 748 (2) [Compliance review] enabling the complaining party (in this case the party that has been notified of rebalancing measures and had requested the tribunal ruling) to seek a further ruling on whether the notified measures are in compliance with tribunal ruling.  •  Article 749 [Temporary remedies] allowing the complaining party to request “temporary compensation” or suspend certain provisions of the Agreement. This includes the possibility of cross-retaliation across different parts of the Agreement, and provisions allowing the responding party to seek a ruling from the tribunal on whether these measures are proportionate (see explanation of Article 749 in section 8.3).  •  Article 750 [Review of any measure taken to comply after the adoption of temporary remedies] allowing the complaining party to seek another ruling from the arbitration panel on whether compliance has been achieved.  When applied in Article 411 (3) these procedures “shall have no suspensive effect on the application of the notified measures pursuant to this paragraph”. f.  Where rebalancing measures were adopted prior to the arbitration ruling in accordance with point (c), any countermeasures adopted pursuant to that point shall be withdrawn immediately, and in no case later than five days after delivery of the tribunal ruling.  g.  Neither of the parties can invoke the WTO Agreement or any other international agreement to preclude the other party from taking rebalancing measures or countermeasures under this Article.  68 The UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement: Level Playing Field  h.  If the notified party has not requested a ruling from an arbitration panel in the time period set out under point (b) then it can initiate the arbitration procedure set out in Part Six but without the need for prior consultations in the Partnership Council, and Article 744 [Urgent proceedings] will be applied. This means the tribunal would need to deliver a ruling within 65 days, and an interim report within 50 days.  Also of relevance to this article is Article 762 which states that where a party takes a measure under treaty articles including Article 411, then the measure shall only be applied in respect of covered provisions within the meaning of Article 735 (those parts of the Agreement covered by the Part Six dispute settlement provisions) and shall comply in the same way (mutatis mutandis) with the conditions set out in Article 749 (3). The latter exempts certain parts of the TCA from cross-retaliation, meaning that cross-retaliation would be possible across the areas not exempt (see section 8.3 for explanation of covered and exempt provisions for the purpose of cross-retaliation).  8.6 Review provisions Paragraphs 4 to 11 of Article 411 provide for a possible review of the Trade heading of the TCA. This review mechanism opens up the possibility of the entire trade part of the agreement being suspended in case of a persistent dispute. The road transport would be terminated alongside the trade provisions. The aviation heading could also possibly be terminated. Under Article 411 (4) a review can take place no sooner than four years after the entry of force of the TCA at a party’s request. Under Article 411 (5) a review can take place sooner than four years at the request of a party under more specific circumstances: this would be if the party feels that measures under the rebalancing mechanism have been taken too frequently or if a measure with a material impact on trade or investment between the parties has been applied for a period of 12 months or more. The parties can agree that other Agreement headings be added to the review. There can be repeated reviews, but these need to be at least four years apart (Article 411 (7)). Reviews will address whether the TCA “delivers an appropriate balance of rights and obligations between the Parties” and whether there is a need for the terms of the Agreement to be modified. Where a party considers that following the review there is a need for a treaty amendment then the parties “shall use their best endeavours to negotiate and conclude an agreement making the necessary amendments”. The negotiations will be limited to matters identified in the review. If an amending agreement has not been concluded after one year of these negotiations, then either party may give notice to terminate Heading One (trade) or any other Agreement heading that had been added to the review. Alternatively, the parties may decide to  69 Commons Library Briefing, 20 May 2021  continue negotiations. If a party terminates Heading One (trade) following this process, then Heading Three (road transport) shall be terminated on the same date. The termination will take place three months after notice has been given. Where the trade heading has been terminated, Heading Two (aviation) will also be terminated unless the parties agree to integrate the relevant parts of the Title XI level playing field provisions into the aviation heading.
