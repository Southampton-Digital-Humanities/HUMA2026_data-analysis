Welcome to the Sixth Senedd and to
this specially prepared publication
from the Senedd Research team
We publish this document at an extraordinary moment in time. We are in the
midst of a global pandemic, in a shifting constitutional landscape with the UK
no longer a member of the EU, and with the UN Climate Change Conference
(COP26) in November refocusing attention on tackling the threat of climate
change.
In many ways, this Senedd is at the beginning of a road taking us into uncharted
territory, with everyone asking the same question: what’s next?
Members of the Sixth Senedd will have to make some huge decisions about
the future of Wales, from dealing with hospital waiting lists to air quality,
post pandemic economic recovery to education reform. Themes like digital
transformation, inequality, constitutional change and public finances will likely
influence decision-making too.
Access to independent research and analysis to inform these decisions is more
important than ever, especially in a world where information is readily available
but also increasingly contested.
Senedd Research is an impartial research and information service. Our work is
designed to help all Members of the Senedd and their staff scrutinise legislation,
hold the government to account and support constituents. We do this through a
confidential enquiry service open to all Members, and in our support for Senedd
committees. We also publish a wide range of impartial and accessible research
articles aimed at Members and their staff, which are available for everyone to
read on our website.
Our researchers are policy experts who have a wealth of knowledge and
experience. The team also supports the exchange of knowledge and expertise
between external researchers and the Senedd, working with academics and
institutions from Wales and beyond.

Title: Research Briefing

This publication is a great starting point for everyone interested in getting
to grips with the challenging social, economic and public policy issues of
the day. You can keep up to date with our published work by following us

The COVID-19 pandemic: where are we?
Over the past year we have learned more about the virus,
how it spreads, what treatments are effective, and developed
vaccines. But where are we on the journey of the pandemic?
And what might be around the corner for the new Senedd
and Welsh Government?
Lucy Morgan
For more than a year the world has been gripped by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is
one of the biggest public health challenges of our time, and the wider social and
economic impact is exceptional.
On 11 March 2020 the World Health Organisation (WHO) first described
COVID-19 as a pandemic. Less than two weeks later everyone in the UK was told to
stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives. While restrictions were eased over
the summer, cases began to rise again in the winter months and the stay at home
rules came back into force.
The four governments of the UK introduced a range of measures to tackle the
virus and, while broadly following the same strategy, they have often taken
different steps at different times.

The current state of the pandemic
The pandemic changed our lives in ways that would have been unimaginable at
the start of 2020. Our freedoms, life plans, and opportunities have been restricted
for long periods of time, some of which will have far-reaching consequences.
The restrictions have largely been underpinned by laws, which are reviewed every
three weeks, alongside detailed guidance.
The previous Welsh Government set out a coronavirus control plan, which
consisted of four alert levels. The plan was updated in March in light of the more
transmissible Kent variant of the virus and the impact of the vaccine rollout.

10

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

Over the last few months Wales has slowly moved from the highest alert level
4 and into alert level 3. The then First Minister, Mark Drakeford, set out a more
detailed timeline of how restrictions will be eased through to the middle of
May.
The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines started in December. Since then (at the time of
writing) more than 1.6 million people have received a first dose of a vaccine (which
is 51% of the Welsh population), and more than 550,000 have received both doses
(17% of the population). The previous Welsh Government aimed to offer a vaccine
to all adults by the end of July.

The immediate challenges
There are a number of immediate challenges facing the new Senedd and Welsh
Government due to the pandemic.
The vaccine programme
The four UK governments have been in a cycle of imposing and easing restrictions
for over a year. The vaccines are hailed as an end to these lockdowns, but will this
actually be the case?
While the vaccination programme is progressing at speed, there are still some
issues.
So far, vaccine uptake has been lower than average among some ethnic
groups and in deprived areas, following patterns seen in previous vaccination
programmes. Public Health Wales has raised concerns about the “significant
inequalities in coverage of COVID-19 vaccine”. The biggest cause for alarm is that
the same groups with lower levels of uptake of the vaccine are also the ones who
are at a higher risk of death from COVID-19.
A resurgence of the virus is likely because many people are not protected from
COVID-19, either because they haven’t been vaccinated or because the vaccine
won’t prevent all infection or illness. This means that communities where uptake is
lower will be particularly at risk from an increase in the transmission of COVID-19.
The Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines are showing early signs of reducing the
risk of hospitalisation. AstraZeneca are also reporting that its vaccine has the
potential to reduce asymptomatic transmission of the virus by 67%.

11

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

But new variants of COVID-19 are emerging and one of the biggest risks is
that “they may be more transmissible or they may bypass the vaccines”. The UK
Government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) warns of the
threat posed by new variants to the UK even if a high proportion of the population
were vaccinated.
It’s hoped that the vaccines can be tweaked to tackle a variant, with the possibility
of a booster jab being provided later in the year if necessary. But the problems
with vaccine uptake among certain communities will be harder to solve.
And what role could ‘vaccine passports’ play in the coming months as the
economy and society open up? There are ethical, privacy, and legal issues as well
as human rights concerns that will need to be considered alongside any such
policy.
Keeping the virus under control
At the beginning of 2021 a number of scenarios were modelled, with all outcomes
resulting in a third wave of the pandemic.
Imperial College London stated that “due to eligibility and vaccine hesitancy,
vaccination alone will not be sufficient to keep the epidemic under control”, and
advised that restrictions should be lifted slowly, with some remaining in place
throughout 2021.
SAGE advises that it’s easier to maintain control of the epidemic when levels of
prevalence are low because “it provides more time to respond to increases before
healthcare systems are overwhelmed [and] allows test, trace and isolate systems to
operate more effectively”.
Wales’ Test, Trace, Protect (TTP) system will continue to play a crucial role in
maintaining control of the virus to identify who has COVID-19 and their recent
contacts and requiring them to self-isolate to stop transmission. Testing and
subsequent genomics also help identify new variants and their characteristics.
England and Scotland published timelines for easing restrictions early in 2021. A
key issue for the new Welsh Government will be balancing the scientific advice
for a slow and cautious reopening against various social, economic, and political
pressures.

12

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

The long term issues and recovery
Attention will soon turn to the longer term handling of the pandemic and
managing its impact.
Some argue for a ‘zero COVID’ or elimination approach to break the cycle of
lockdowns, similar to New Zealand. But not all believe it’s possible to achieve
given that countries will have to open up their borders at some point. Others
advocate ‘herd immunity’ due to the harms caused by lockdowns, yet the
threshold to achieve this is currently unknown and likely to be very high.
The pandemic accelerated innovation in digital technology and reshaped how we
work and learn. But the backlog in the NHS is now the worst on record and there
are concerns about the effect of delayed treatments on patients’ wellbeing.
Many children have experienced a year of disrupted learning with the gap in
educational attainment growing. Some people have been disproportionality
affected by the pandemic with existing inequalities being exacerbated. Meanwhile
the response of the four UK governments in controlling the virus has thrown light
on devolution across the UK with the differing rules between nations.
Although we’re starting a new Senedd, the virus is still with us and presenting the
same challenges as we’ve faced in the past year, along with some new ones. But
there’s an opportunity to look to the future and to shape a post-pandemic Wales.

Is this the Brexit season f inale?
For many, the announcement of a deal between the UK
and EU on Christmas Eve 2020 marked the end of the longrunning Brexit negotiation drama. In reality, the agreement
forms the bare outline of the future relationship plot. The
twists and turns of what the relationship means in practice
will be a key part of the Sixth Senedd’s story.
Nia Moss, Sara Moran, Rhun Davies and Joe Wilkes
At first glance, the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) is a free trade
deal like any other. Yet it’s much more than that. It covers many areas not usually
found in trade agreements such as health and social security. Its terms are lengthy,
intertwined and complex. The majority of its provisions affect areas within the
Senedd’s responsibility, from fisheries arrangements to healthcare insurance.
Many of the details about how the TCA will work in practice are not yet clear. Welsh
businesses and citizens still face uncertainty about what it means for them.
The Sixth Senedd may find that the drama is far from over.

What’s been agreed and what does it mean for Wales?
The TCA lays the foundation for the UK and EU’s new relationship. It follows the
Withdrawal Agreement, which set the terms of the UK’s separation from the EU.
The TCA is unprecedented because it resets the relationship between the UK
and EU, in a way which puts them farther apart, rather than bringing them closer
together.
Even though it covers many areas of UK-EU cooperation, some important
arrangements are not yet finalised.

14

Areas covered by the new UK-EU relationship

The TCA will shape many parts of life in Wales, such as business and trade
environment, fisheries, health and travel.

Business and trade
The way the UK trades with the EU has fundamentally changed. In the TCA, the UK
and EU agreed that there are no tariffs or quotas on trade in goods, provided rules
of origin are met. However, there are new non-tariff barriers which have resulted
in increased costs for businesses. Some sectors, such as some shellfish producers,
have also been unable to sell their produce to the EU due to its rules on trade with
third countries.
The EU introduced full border controls on goods from Great Britain on 1 January,
while the UK will phase-in its border controls in stages until March 2022.
New border infrastructure will need to be built in Wales, and the new Welsh

15

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

Government will have some responsibilities in relation to border processes, such as
checks on animals.
The previous Welsh Government said that “the precise impact of the TCA will
take time to become clear in many areas”. The Sixth Senedd will need to monitor
its impact on Welsh businesses trading with the EU, as well as scrutinising how the
new Welsh Government implements its responsibilities.

Environment and f isheries
Environmental cooperation is folded into the TCA in a number of ways. On one
hand, it makes up part of the so-called ‘level playing field’ to ensure fair competition
between the UK and EU so that standards can’t be reduced without consequence.
On the other, the entire partnership is based on a commitment to address climate
change, which constitutes an essential element of this and all future UK-EU
agreements.
Fisheries arrangements became a sticking point in the negotiations but
agreement was finally reached. One new arrangement provides that 25% of the
EU’s quota in UK waters will be transferred to the UK over a five and a half year
period. Many other parts of the TCA are linked to the fisheries arrangements. For
example, if the UK or EU restricts access to their waters, the other can retaliate with
tariffs. Or if one side decides to end the fisheries arrangements, the arrangements
for aviation and road transport will also cease.

Health
Different types of UK-EU cooperation on health are included in the TCA. For
example, there’s a general duty to cooperate on serious cross-border threats to
health. There are also specific provisions maintaining the validity of European
Health Insurance Cards (EHIC) until their expiration, and on the rights of UK citizens
travelling in the EU to access some types of healthcare, and vice versa.

Travel
Rules on travel from Wales to EU countries, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and
Liechtenstein have changed under the TCA for holidays, work, study and residency.
Changes include visa and permit requirements (depending on the length of stay
and the country visited), additional passenger checks and new rules for driving, pet
travel, mobile roaming and compensation if travel is disrupted.

16

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

On the horizon
The TCA contains a number of future deadlines on decisions not taken in
December 2020, including establishing new bodies to implement the agreement,
and for the review of some of its provisions. Important deadlines fall during this
Senedd’s term.
The agreement establishes 24 UK-EU committees and working groups. They’ll
play a crucial strategic role in overseeing and implementing the agreement, as
well as on its future direction and content. Their membership, including what
role devolved governments will play, is not yet agreed. A UK-EU Parliamentary
Partnership Assembly will also be established. Discussions on its format and how it
will engage the devolved legislatures are on-going.
A joint review of the UK-EU agreement is required every five years. The agreement
also allows either the UK or the EU to call for a review of the agreement’s trade
provisions after four years if they believe that either side is not honouring its
commitments on fair competition. This could lead to further changes in the
trading relationship. Other parts of the agreement could also be included within
this review.
The agreement is complex and many of its provisions are yet to be ‘road-tested’.
Agreeing how the text should be interpreted, and how it should operate in
practice, is likely to take some time. For example, the agreement requires that
UK and EU environmental supervisory bodies meet regularly and co-operate
on the effective enforcement of the agreement’s environmental commitments.
What form these meetings will take, who will be involved and what role devolved
regulators will have, is yet to be decided.
In addition, discussions will continue in some areas important to Wales where
agreement wasn’t reached. These include protected Welsh food and drink names,
EU funding programmes and the mutual recognition of professional qualifications
(MRPQ).

“Much more to be done”
The list of tasks for the Sixth Senedd in relation to the TCA and the Senedd’s future
engagement with Europe is long. As the Fifth Senedd’s External Affairs And
Additional Legislation Committee said, “there is much more to be done in terms
of assessing the implications for Wales”.

17

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

The agreement is new and untested. The details of its practical operation are not
yet agreed. It’s dynamic and will evolve and be reviewed during this Senedd. New
relationships are bedding in, and the Senedd and Welsh Government will need to
define and find their place in these. The effects of the new relationship on the UK
constitution, and Wales’ place in World, will unfold as the Sixth Senedd progresses.
While December 2020 may have marked the end of Season 1 of Brexit, Season 2:
The new relationship is only just beginning.

Are we at a tipping point of inequality?
The landscape of inequality exposed by the pandemic
largely followed the contours of existing disadvantage. But
will previous approaches to reducing inequality be enough
to counter these stark imbalances, or will new strategies be
needed? And what role does data - or the lack of it - play?
Hannah Johnson
The language of equality is used across the political spectrum, from ‘social mobility’
to ‘levelling up’, and ‘intergenerational fairness’ to ‘social justice’. At the core is
the idea that some people, groups, or areas are disproportionately or unfairly
advantaged - whether economically, socially, culturally, or politically – because of
systems and structures that enable it.
The pandemic has brutally demonstrated what these inequalities mean for
people’s lives on a scale not previously seen. Our chances of dying, getting
seriously ill, losing jobs, experiencing abuse, or falling behind in education have
been in part determined by who we are, our finances, our health, and where we
live.
These factors, intertwined with others like adequate housing, the ability to homework, and access to childcare, a car, outside space, and reliable internet, act to
increase or decrease disadvantage.
And it leads us to ask a fundamental question: is this fair?
If not, what kind of policy interventions and systemic changes are needed to close
the gaps?

Why is inequality a problem?
We often hear that a rising tide of economic growth lifts all boats. But in
reality, a rising tide of inequality sinks all boats. […] From the exercise of
global power to racism, gender discrimination and income disparities,
inequality threatens our wellbeing and our future.
- United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres

19

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

Inequality is increasingly a problem for us all. It’s estimated to cost the UK £39
billion a year, as managing the outcomes, like homelessness, are usually costlier
than prevention. And while domestic abuse was recently estimated to cost the
UK £66 billion a year, achieving economic gender equality could boost Wales’s
economy by nearly £14 billion.
Inequality might also slow down post-pandemic recovery. The lower take-up of
vaccines among some ethnic groups and those living in the most deprived areas
are of particular concern. Targeted misinformation, and long-term distrust of public
authorities linked to structural and institutional racism and discrimination, are
likely causes that will need more than a public engagement campaign to solve.

Equal treatment or equal outcomes?
Inequalities can be reduced either through universal policies that treat everyone the
same, or by targeting them at those most in need.
Proponents of ideas like a universal basic income (UBI) argue the pandemic has
shown that resources for comprehensive social protection for everyone can be
found. Others contend that ‘positive action’, which favours certain groups, helps to
equalise outcomes by addressing historic disadvantage. ‘Proportionate universalism’
is somewhere in between, where services are available to all but with effort
targeted where it’s most needed.

20

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

During the pandemic, some policies were targeted at people at higher risk
based on their vulnerabilities. These include the ‘shielding’ programme, which
recognised deprivation and ethnicity as risk factors in England, and the Welsh
workforce risk assessment tool, which used demographics and health
conditions to create a ‘risk score’ and suggested mitigation measures.
The previous Welsh Government also launched a benefits take up campaign
aimed at those most in need of financial support, and a helpline specifically for
people from ethnic groups disproportionately affected by the virus.

What don’t we know?
Absence of evidence isn’t evidence of absence. If interventions are targeted at those
who lost the most in the crisis, it’s important that no-one is left uncounted.
In 2020 a Senedd committee voiced concerns about the poor quality of equality
data available in Wales. This was echoed by the House of Commons Women and
Equalities Committee, which specifically called for the collection of redundancy
data disaggregated by sex, ethnicity, and other characteristics.
We also know that where these factors intersect, inequalities are amplified. Some
groups were hit particularly hard by lockdown, when 39% of all female employees
under 25, and 44% of workers of Bangladeshi ethnicity, were working in shut-down
sectors in Wales.
Overlaying this data allows for a more nuanced understanding of risk, power,
wealth, security, need, and experience, rather than treating broad demographic
groups as homogenous. The previous Welsh Government repeatedly emphasised
its intersectional approach to equality. But a lack of disaggregated, intersectional
data frustrates meaningful analysis.
The collection of personal data by public authorities is sensitive, and requires
trust. And targeting policies at certain groups can be seen as tokenistic or even
discriminatory. These issues may present challenges for policy design in the
coming years.

21

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

Are the tools up to the job?
The reduction of inequalities was at the core of the previous Welsh Government’s
COVID-19 plan for recovery. It also set bold ambitions to become a ‘feminist
government’, and a ‘world leader for gender equality’.
In March 2021, the Socio-economic Duty was commenced in Wales. It requires
most public authorities to consider how they can improve outcomes for people on
low incomes when making strategic decisions.
This will sit alongside the existing public sector equality duties, which compel
Welsh public authorities to do things like conduct equality impact assessments,
develop equality plans and objectives, and collect equality data. The Well-being of
Future Generations Act also requires public authorities to think about the longterm impact of their decisions on equality and cohesion.
But it’s difficult to measure the effectiveness of these duties. If inequalities in a
particular policy area are not decreasing, does it indicate that the duty isn’t being
fulfilled, or that it isn’t working? What if the levers of change aren’t devolved? And
if an impact assessment uncovers an unfair impact, is there a duty to act on it?
Does this approach make sure we collect quality data?
With such unambiguous and widening inequalities at the forefront of political
debate, the new Welsh Government will have to decide if previous approaches will
work in the post-pandemic world.
The Sixth Senedd will also be critical in challenging the new Welsh Government to
show how it’s translating big ambitions on equality into tangible change.

The digital uprising
The pandemic put a stop to business as usual, pushing public
services, companies, and individuals to rapidly adopt new
behaviours. We’ve worked at home, shopped online, learnt
remotely, and socialised from afar.
The past year has also advanced the digital agenda and
accelerated the speed of innovation . But what’s the role of
policymakers in this increasingly virtual world? And how can
inequalities caused by digital exclusion be reduced?
Lorna Scurlock
The world is changing. In 2016 it was declared that:
We stand on the brink of a technological revolution that will
fundamentally alter the way we live, work, and relate to one another.
But the technology trends that propelled the fourth industrial revolution, known
also as the ‘intelligence revolution’ or ‘industry 4.0’, have been accelerated further
by the pandemic. One tech leader said they had seen “two years’ worth of digital
transformation in two months”.

Heads in the cloud
Storing and accessing data and programmes over the internet, known as ‘cloud
computing’, has been vital in helping us adapt.
Cloud computing was harnessed to support the public health response through
contact tracing apps and virtual healthcare, and allowed the delivery of critical
public services.
The use of online team collaboration tools has soared, with Microsoft Teams
experiencing a 40% increase in demand during lockdown. Cloud-based
applications allowed educators to deliver online learning, and provided knockon positives for the environment too.

23

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

The flexibility of cloud computing helped shaped our lives and accelerated its
adoption in 2020, with further growth forecast in 2021. But this comes with
increased data safety and security risks, which will demand a proactive
approach to keep cloud environments secure. And what skills will the workforce
need to adapt to cloud computing long-term?

New digital habits
While high street retailers have suffered, internet sales as a percentage of total
retail sales in the UK rose from 22% at the beginning of March 2020, to over 36% in
January 2021. Net profit for Amazon was up 84% for the year. This shift to digital
transactions has also propelled growth in delivery, transportation, and warehouse
jobs.
It’s impossible to not mention the rise in video conferencing software. ‘Zoom’
was a verb in 2019, but is now a household company name. It is described as
the pandemic’s success story, and has reported more than 300 million
daily participants in virtual meetings. Video conferencing has enabled a safe
continuation of a whole host of activities, not to mention the work of the Senedd,
which was the first parliament in the UK to go virtual.

’The great home-working experiment’
To minimise the risk of exposure to
the virus, and supported by cloud
computing, those that could, worked
from home. This led to the reshaping
of company culture, and a few
interesting online interactions. Even
Hollywood stars had to adapt.
Recent research found that homeworking in Wales increased from 3.8%
to 36.8% between March and April 2020. It also found 93.3% of employees wanted
to continue working from home, suggesting that:
… the great homeworking experiment will become an entrenched and
widely accepted feature of work even when social distancing restrictions
are fully lifted.
The previous Welsh Government set a long-term ambition for 30% of the Welsh
workforce to work remotely on a regular basis, and some employers have already

24

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

committed to more homeworking and less office space. Others are aiming for
workforces to be ‘hyper-collaborative’ when in the office, and ‘hyper-productive’
when working at home.
A report by McKinsey found that continued remote working and virtual meetings:
… could prompt a large change in the geography of work, as individuals
and companies shift out of large cities into suburbs and small cities.
Office for National Statistics (ONS) analysis found that ‘those that could’ adapt
to home working are employees in higher-paying jobs. Another study found that
lower paid workers are more likely to lose their jobs as a result of the pandemic,
potentially worsening existing inequalities in the labour market.
What will be the impact of increased homeworking on our health and lifestyles?
And will urban retail, hospitality, and public transport ever return to pre-pandemic
levels?

A new revolution
The ‘intelligence revolution’ means that an increasing range of intellectual tasks can
be performed by AI, robotics, and automation, mirroring how the first industrial
revolution drove the automation of repetitive physical tasks.
The previous Senedd’s economy committee considered it ‘imperative’ that Wales
should be “the provider, not just the consumer of emerging technologies”. A key
message of the last Welsh Government’s 2019 review into digital innovation and
the future of work was that:
… over the next decade, digital technologies will result in both job
displacement and creation, but of even greater significance is its impact
on how we experience work.
The proportion of jobs at high risk of automation by the early 2030s varies from
26% to over 36% across Welsh regions. A 2017 study into where automation will
hit hardest found that:
… the unequal geographical distribution of the impact of automation
deserves immediate attention by Government, particularly as it is regions
that have previously suffered the effects of industrial decline that are
likely to be worst hit.

25

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

So how can policymakers make sure that digital innovation doesn’t create or
worsen inequalities between people and regions? And how can sectors like
manufacturing be equipped to take advantage of the new opportunities associated
with technological change?

The need for speed
Businesses and individuals with increasing digital demands need to be supported
by reliable digital infrastructure.
It is estimated that 94% of Welsh premises have access to superfast broadband.
But a Welsh Government study from 2019 suggested around 79,000 properties do
not, and with no prospect of connection in the next three years.
Ofcom estimates that around 18,000 (1.2%) Welsh premises cannot access “decent
broadband”.
In December 2020 the National Infrastructure Commission (NIC) published a
report into digital communications infrastructure. Among other things, this
report concluded that:
Too much attention has been paid by policymakers to promoting fibre
to the home technology in the UK and not enough on improving mobile
broadband provision.

New digital inequalities
Despite being an integral part of modern society, internet accessibility isn’t equal,
and 10% of people are still not online or using the internet regularly. Yet local
infrastructure isn’t the only barrier to digital inclusion, and other challenges
include low income and inability to get a data contract.
ONS analysis exploring the digital divide shows that although digital skills
are increasingly important, people remain excluded. Digital inclusion has been
described as a “key social justice and equalities issue”.
The previous Welsh Government’s digital inclusion strategy explains that the
pandemic has:
… drawn attention to the widening inequalities caused by digital
exclusion in accessing services, receiving vital information and
purchasing goods online. The accelerating shift of public services to
online platforms risks further increasing the gap between the digitally
included and excluded.

26

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

The Wales Centre for Public Policy says that Wales’ digital inclusion strategy needs
to be “tailored to the challenges faced by different groups”, recognising that some
will still need access to high quality in-person services.
A new Digital Strategy for Wales and its delivery plan were recently published,
setting out the last Welsh Government’s vision and ambition for a coordinated
digital approach. But it’s clear that:
… digital is not just about computers – it’s about people.

How can Wales get the media it needs?
Policymakers face a conundrum as to how to support a sector
that is vital to democracy, but works best at a distance from
those that wield democratic power.
Robin Wilkinson
What happens to a democracy when people lose access to trusted and reliable
information about the people they can vote for? Since 1999, as the Senedd
has gained further powers, professional journalism has retreated from local
communities in Wales, as it has across the world.
At the end of the Fifth Senedd, the Culture, Welsh Language and Communications
(CWLC) Committee concluded that the “supply of media content for Wales is
inadequate”. The biggest shortfall it identified was in news and current affairs.

Print pounds turn to digital pennies
Welsh newspapers have seen continued decline in their print circulations. Since
2008 the Western Mail’s circulation has sunk by over three-quarters – from 37,576
to 8,419 in 2020. Over the same period, the Daily Post’s circulation has more
than halved – from 36,432 in 2008 to 14,250 in 2020. This is in sync with what
has happened in the UK dailies, with the Mirror and the Express both more than
halving their circulations over the same period. These patterns are mirrored across
the world.
While print circulation has dwindled, online traffic has soared. WalesOnline’s use
grew by over 1400% between 2008 and 2020, with monthly visitor numbers up
from 680,000 in March 2008 to 9.7 million in June 2020.
News organisations have struggled to monetise this increasing traffic. Other than
a few examples, they have been reluctant to charge for access to their content,
instead relying on digital advertising, the bulk of which is hoovered up by Google
and Facebook.
The result has been newspaper closures, job losses and market consolidation
by the big players. These trends accelerated during the pandemic, despite
increased news consumption. UK Government analysis in July 2020 suggested
an advertising revenue reduction of 20.5% on the previous year for national

28

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

newspapers, and a 24.1% decline for regional newspapers. Declining print sales
were further impacted by lockdowns, as shopping footfall plummeted.

Television and radio are losing audiences to unregulated
competition
News isn’t all about newspapers. Television remains the most common news
source in Wales, being used by 75% of people, compared to 43% for radio, 33%
for print newspapers, and 31% for other websites and apps – including those
dedicated to news.
But regulated broadcast services that carry news – such as the BBC, ITV and
commercial radio – are all losing audiences to largely unregulated online
competition such as Netflix and Spotify. These streaming platforms may carry
some news and current affairs content, but they aren’t required to by regulation,
and so far this content forms only an incidental part of their business models.
A growing proportion of people – 46% in 2020 – gain their news from social media.
Again, this is largely unregulated and, despite carrying reliable news from trusted
sources, is bedevilled with concerns about disinformation and fake news

Loss of news suppresses voter turnout and increases corruption
There are many theoretical arguments for the value of news journalism in a liberal
democracy. These include encouraging an informed public, political accountability
and plurality of opinion. Recent research, summarised in a report for the UK
Government Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has given these
claims an empirical basis.
The authors found that an additional daily or weekly local newspaper title
increased voter turnout by 1.27 percentage points, and that “the closure of local
and regional news titles has led to underreporting and less scrutiny of democratic
functions”. Other cited benefits of public interest journalism range from reducing
political polarisation to saving public money by reducing corruption and public
mismanagement.
The devolved nature of many powers used to respond to the pandemic provided
a worked example of the importance of Welsh news. In April 2020, the Fifth
Senedd’s CWLC Committee wrote to the House of Commons Digital, Culture,
Media and Sport Committee outlining the potential of misreporting to damage
public health, citing inaccurate news reports from across the UK press. The most

29

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

popular print and online newspapers in Wales are the Mail and the Sun.
Readers in Wales are therefore often reliant on London-based editors to clearly
communicate what lockdown measures are in place in Wales.
The Committee’s claims were backed-up by research by Professor Cushion at
Cardiff University. He found that the “vast majority” of study participants could spot
“fake news”, such as quack cures for COVID-19. But many cited “government or
media misinformation” as sources of misleading information about the pandemic.

A challenge for policy makers, which the Welsh Government
does not have all the tools to address
The decline of news journalism provides a significant challenge for policy-makers.
In recent history they have been able to rely on the market to provide a flow of
broadly reliable and trustworthy news.
The freedom of this market hasn’t been absolute – with newspapers longreceiving tax-breaks and implicit subsidies in the form of paid-for advertisements
from public bodies. And broadcast media is either publicly-funded (such as the
BBC and S4C) or regulated to ensure reliable news content. But this approach has
helped politicians minimise the awkwardness of directly interfering in a sector
that’s dependent on independence from the state to do its job.
In 2018 the CWLC Committee called the retreat of news journalism from Wales “a
profound public policy issue, which policy makers at all levels, not least the Welsh
Government, need to address as a priority issue”.
The previous Welsh Government accepted this recommendation in principle,
but was limited in what it could do. “Broadcasting and other media” is a reserved
matter, meaning that the power to pass laws in this area rests with the UK
Parliament. This leaves direct funding as the main policy option for the Welsh
Government.
Welsh Governments have long-funded Welsh language news and current affairs,
via the Welsh Books Council, in recognition of the market failure in this area. In
recent years it’s provided funding for some English-language journalism, such as
Nation.Cymru – via the Books Council, and ‘hyperlocal journalism’ via its own
£200,000 Independent Community Journalism Fund. The argument, made by
the CWLC Committee, that the market for English-language journalism in Wales
has also failed, seemed to have been accepted by the previous Welsh Government.

30

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

The then Deputy Minister for Culture, Media and Sport, Lord Elis-Thomas, had
previously said that it was “not for Welsh Government to be providing media
outlets or supporting media outlets”. But by the end of the Fifth Senedd he
revealed that discussions were “ongoing” to provide further support to Englishlanguage journalism “similar to the Welsh language model”. The Senedd
Commission has also explored whether it could offer support to journalism.
Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg has long called for the devolution of broadcasting
to give the Welsh Government more tools to support the media. These proposals
recently gained limited support from the CWLC Committee. But further powers
would mean that tricky questions about how to increase public service content
in an age of deregulation would be for the Welsh Government, rather than UK
Government, to answer.
Though several new news services for Wales have started in recent years (such as
Nation.Cymru and The National), none of the broader market trends show any
sign of abating. If politicians want people to know more about the people and
institutions they vote for, it will be up to them to work out how.

Social care: a system at breaking point?
The pandemic has drawn attention to the importance of the
social care sector, but also demonstrated the fragility of the
system. Will COVID-19 be a catalyst for change?
Amy Clifton
The stark pressures facing the social care sector have been brought into the
spotlight during the pandemic.
There’s a new recognition and appreciation of social care staff, but inequalities in
how they are treated compared to NHS staff are even more exposed. The need for
better support for Wales’ ever-increasing population of unpaid carers has also been
highlighted.
It’s widely accepted that fundamental reform of social care is long overdue. There
have been numerous Welsh and UK Government papers and reports on reform,
but the can has been repeatedly kicked down the road.

The social care workforce
Care work is generally regarded as a low pay, low status profession, with limited
opportunities for career progression. The sector suffers from staff shortages, high
staff turnover, and major difficulties in recruitment. Social care is consistently losing
staff to sectors like retail, which offer better pay and conditions.
56% of the social care workforce in Wales earn below the Real Living Wage
(£9.50 an hour). Wages are similar in Wales and England, but markedly higher in
Scotland.
Residential care workers in Wales have faced a decade of no relative
improvement in pay, and their median wage remained below the Real Living
Wage for most of that period. Wages in residential care are also much lower than
the service industry average.

Source: ONS, Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, 2020, Table 5.5a. Data point for the 90th
percentile of residential care workers has been removed as the estimate is deemed unreliable.

During the pandemic the social care workforce faced trauma and significant
personal risk, with workers in Wales and England twice as likely to die with
COVID-19, compared to the general working-age population.
In March the Fifth Senedd’s Health, Social Care and Sport (HSCS) Committee,
alongside stakeholders, called for parity of esteem for social care workers with
NHS staff, in terms of pay, working conditions and recognition.
The Social Care Fair Work Forum (a partnership of Welsh Government, employers
and unions) concluded later that month that the Real Living Wage should be
the minimum pay received by social care workers. It sees this change as the most
urgent priority to improve working conditions.

35

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

The role of unpaid carers
The majority of care is provided by unpaid carers (typically family or friends) rather
than commissioned services. Even before the pandemic it was estimated that
unpaid carers provide 96% of all care in Wales.
The replacement cost of care provided by unpaid carers (i.e. purchasing this care
at market price) is estimated at £8 billion – roughly the same as the annual NHS
Wales budget.
Carers have taken on more caring responsibilities during the pandemic and are
now said to be at breaking point, exhausted from long periods of caring without
breaks or support. Support services such as respite care, which were already in
short supply, have reduced or stopped altogether. Many carers are also struggling
financially, and stakeholders want to see greater financial assistance made
available.
Any plans for social care reform must recognise the pivotal role of unpaid carers,
which isn’t sustainable without improved access to support. As the Fifth Senedd’s
HSCS Committee said:
Carers give so much to the people they care for and without them, our
health and social care systems would be overwhelmed and unable to
function. They must be supported, recognised and rewarded to enable
them to continue caring for as long as they wish to do.

The relationship between health and social care
At the start of the pandemic, it was suggested that social care was an
afterthought. Vital PPE and access to testing for care workers were significantly
delayed in comparison to the NHS.
Patients being discharged from hospitals to care settings (sometimes in the
middle of the night) without a negative COVID-19 test result continues to be a
cause for concern among stakeholders. The Association of Directors of Social
Services (ADSS) Cymru says this has resulted in a significant breakdown of trust
between care homes and hospitals. Carers charities also raised concerns about
poor hospital discharge practices putting pressure on unpaid carers.
Better integration of health and social care has long been a political ambition but
real progress remains to be seen. In 2014, the last Welsh Government established
an Integrated Care Fund (ICF), with the aim of driving this forward. However, the

36

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

Wales Audit Office has been critical of the fund’s overall impact.

Service pressures
The pandemic exacerbated the already precarious financial position of many care
providers and provoked further doubt about the long-term viability of the current
service model, particularly within the residential care market.
Residential care is extremely fragmented. There are over 1,000 separate care
homes, the vast majority of which are small, independent businesses, that
provide the lion’s share of adult care home places.
Number of adult care home places, by local authority and provider type,
March 2021

Source: Care Inspectorate Wales, March 2021, user requested data. Data rounded to the nearest 10.

It’s widely accepted that the care system is underfunded, and local authority fee
levels don’t appear to have kept pace with rising costs. Self-funders are effectively
subsidising costs, on average paying around 25% more in care home fees than
local authorities.
Care homes need a high level of occupancy to be viable, but many have seen
resident numbers drop during the pandemic, causing significant financial strain.
Care homes have also struggled with serious staff shortages due to illness and
staff needing to isolate. In December 2020, a number of care homes reached a

37

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

critical level of staff absence and were on the brink of closure. According to media
reports, residents were close to being moved to hospital because of staffing
levels.
Increased demands and pressures also continue to be felt by home care providers,
particularly with long COVID and patients who’ve had extended stays in hospital.
Looking ahead, long COVID will continue to be a new pressure on services,
adding a new group of service users who (without COVID) may not have needed
social care.

Future demand
Wales has an ageing population, and people are living for longer with complex
care needs and dementia. This will no doubt continue to increase pressure on care
services. The number of older adults living with severe dementia is predicted to
double by 2040.
Even before the pandemic, the Health Foundation estimated that the Welsh social
care budget would need to reach £2.3 billion by 2030/31 to match demand.
The previous Minister for Health and Social Services, Vaughan Gething,
acknowledged that Wales’ already stretched services won’t meet future demand
unless action is taken. He reported that spend on social services could be up to
£400 million higher in 2022-23, just to maintain the current level of services.
The last Welsh Government concluded that radical reform to improve social care
wasn’t likely in the near future, given the challenging economic climate caused by
the pandemic.
The then Minister said that, in the shorter term, measures “working towards
introducing a real living wage for the workforce” could be implemented “as quickly
as is affordable”.
As the Nuffield Trust notes, COVID-19 has pushed the demand for reform up the
agenda:
Never has social care been so prominent in public and political
discussions. There is a groundswell of support for reform that presents a
rare opportunity to achieve tangible change.
Will this translate into action to improve social care by the next Welsh Government?

A mentally well Wales
What are the key challenges and opportunities for improving
mental health and wellbeing in Wales?
Philippa Watkins
There were serious, long-standing concerns about mental health services in Wales
before COVID-19 hit. Several Senedd committees highlighted long waiting times,
high thresholds for treatment, and gaps in service provision. There are new fears
about the impact of the ongoing pandemic on the mental health and wellbeing of
the population, and on some groups in particular.
The long-term effects of the pandemic on mental health are not yet fully
understood. It’s clear that mental health has worsened, and there’s been an
unequal impact on different groups. Young people and those living in poverty have
been hit the hardest.

Mental ill health in Wales/UK

40

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

Impact of the pandemic
More than half of adults and three quarters of young people said their mental
health was worse during the early months of the pandemic. It’s now clear that
COVID-19 has had significant emotional impacts on the population. People
have been exposed to greater levels of stress and anxiety as well as bereavement.
They’ve also been less able to access their usual coping mechanisms (e.g. seeing
friends and family, opportunities to exercise).
While the distress experienced by many could be described as a ‘normal’ response
to an extraordinary situation, people may still have needs for support. In addition,
those with existing mental health problems may have seen their symptoms
deteriorate. In its December 2020 report, the Fifth Senedd’s Health, Social Care
and Sport (HSCS) Committee emphasised that appropriate support must be in
place for everyone who needs it. This must cover the range of mental health need

41

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

- from low-level, early intervention support through to more specialist services and
crisis care.
It’s recognised that the mental health and wellbeing of some groups has been
disproportionately affected. These include:

 people with existing needs for mental health support;
 people on low incomes, or who have seen their employment status change or
are self-employed;

 NHS and care workers, and other frontline staff;
 Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities;
 older adults; and
 children and young people.
Children and young people
During the pandemic, young people reported a range of issues including increased
anxiety, loneliness, and more limited access to mental health and other services
they usually rely on. It’s feared that the disruption to their education, employment
and training opportunities could have a significant, long-term impact on young
people’s wellbeing.
In October 2020, the Children, Young People and Education (CYPE) Committee
published a follow-up to its landmark 2018 Mind over matter report. This sets out
a ‘roadmap’ for improving emotional and mental health support for children
and young people.

Key challenges and opportunities for the next Welsh Government
Managing a backlog of patients alongside increased demand for services
It’s expected to take several years for NHS services to recover and waiting times to
return to pre-pandemic levels. Mental health was not in a strong position before
COVID-19, with many people struggling to access timely, appropriate support.
There’s been progress in some areas, such as the work in schools to improve
support for pupils’ mental wellbeing. But there are still gaps in provision which

42

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

previous governments haven’t managed to address. For example, access to
psychological therapies across Wales remains a challenge.
Although mental health services in Wales were categorised as an essential
service during the pandemic, many people were unable to access services or
delayed seeking help. There are concerns about a potentially high burden of
unmet need, and that some people with existing mental health problems may
have become more severely ill.
The Welsh Government’s health and social care recovery plan (March 2021)
cautions that the NHS could be overwhelmed with referrals for mental health
support. Notably, it says this will be driven by the socio-economic impacts of the
pandemic (rather than medical/specialised mental health needs).
Technology will play a greater role in the delivery of mental health services
During the pandemic, more mental health services have been delivered remotely
with face-to-face appointments significantly reduced. Remote/online services may
be effective at meeting some needs for support, but might not be appropriate or
accessible to all. For example, around 13% of households in Wales have no access to
the internet.
A recent evaluation of video consulting services suggests that there’s a “large
appetite” for video consulting in Wales, with “high potential of sustainability and
long-term use” beyond the pandemic. In the future, we’re likely to see a blended
approach to mental health service delivery, with a combination of face-to-face and
remote services. Addressing the ‘digital divide’ will be key.
Better mental health services are needed, but this isn’t enough on its own
A clear message from stakeholders is that ‘mental health’ does not just sit within
the NHS - it is a much broader, public health issue. Preventing mental ill health
spans government departments and all sectors of society. The Mental Health
Foundation says:
Prevention of mental health problems is possible through effective
societal, community and individual support, but it cannot happen
within the health sector alone – action must be taken in the spaces
where people are born, raised and live (in the home, in schools, their
communities and workplaces).

43

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

A greater focus on mental health
In October 2020, the previous Welsh Government updated its mental health
delivery plan to take account of the pandemic situation. It also appointed a
new Minister for mental health and wellbeing. Its budget for 2021-22 includes
increased funding for mental health services, and recognition that improving public
mental health requires a whole-government approach:
Further investment in mental health can be seen across government, in
line with our approach to prevention and protection of mental health
and well-being, including employment support, debt advice, housing
support, sports and access to green spaces.
In December 2020, the Welsh Government established the Together for Mental
Health Ministerial Delivery and Oversight Board to strengthen governance
arrangements around its mental health strategy and drive this work forward at
greater pace.

Looking to the future
The increased focus on mental health has been broadly welcomed. But will this
be enough to tackle the impacts of the pandemic and deliver the whole-system
approach needed to improve mental health and wellbeing in Wales?
There is consensus that mental health has been chronically underfunded (not
just in Wales but worldwide). Despite the high burden of disease from mental
health problems, mental health receives a small fraction of overall health funding.
An even smaller proportion of health research funding goes to mental health
research. Concerns remain that mental health risks further de-prioritisation in
the ongoing response to the pandemic and the recovery of routine healthcare
services.
Greater parity between mental health and physical health has long been called
for by the sector and by Senedd committees. There may still be a long way to
go before we get there. Committed leadership, joined-up policy, and appropriate
budget allocations will be key to improving public mental health and developing
mental health services fit for the future.

Hospital waiting times: a mountain to climb
The COVID-19 pandemic has put enormous pressure on
health services, with lengthening waiting times for treatment.
What can be done to tackle the backlog?
Paul Worthington
In March 2020 all non-urgent hospital treatments were postponed, freeing up
hospital capacity to deal with the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19
pressures are now easing, but NHS Wales is facing a sizeable backlog. Over half a
million patients are currently waiting for treatment for other conditions. How can
our healthcare services respond to this challenge?

What’s the scale of the challenge?
The Welsh Government’s targets for referral to treatment (RTT) are that 95% of
patients referred for planned hospital treatment should be seen within 26 weeks,
and 100% within 36 weeks. The RTT time also includes time waiting for out-patient
appointments, tests, scans or other procedures that may be needed before being
treated. There are other waiting times targets for diagnostic tests, therapies, and
starting cancer treatment.
Waiting times were already increasing before the pandemic. At their most recent
lowest point, in March 2019, the RTT total stood at 8,985 patients waiting over 36
weeks. But those numbers increased again over following months to 25,549 in
December 2019. Between February 2020 and February 2021, total numbers waiting
to start treatment rose from 461,809 to 549,353, with those waiting over 36 weeks
growing from 25,634 to 217,655 patients – a 749% increase.
A fall in the numbers of patients being referred by GPs for treatment means there
are fewer patients waiting under 36 weeks, but patients who were already on
waiting lists are waiting longer. Around 60% of those waiting over 36 weeks are
waiting for a first out-patient appointment.

There are also Welsh Government targets stating that no-one should wait longer
than eight weeks for diagnostic services, such as X-Rays, or 14 weeks for therapy
services, such as physiotherapy. Between February 2020 and February 2021, the
numbers waiting beyond these targets rose from 3,551 to 48,136 in diagnostics,
and from 197 to 4,129 in therapies.

Where are the key pressures?
The original decision to postpone non-urgent treatment applied across Wales. But
since December 2020, health boards have been able to decide locally when and
how much non-urgent work they could resume. Over time, this may mean the
speed of dealing with the backlog varies across Wales. In December 2020, health
boards were delivering only around half of the pre-pandemic levels of non-urgent
activity.

health board, February 2020 and February 2021

Source: StatsWales, NHS Wales Hospital Waiting Times Referral to treatment

Much of the growth in waiting lists comes from high-volume procedures for
specific conditions, such as hip and knee replacements, or cataracts. Of the 217,655
patients waiting over 36 weeks, the majority are in a small number of specialties,
including 52,173 in orthopaedics, 31,695 in ophthalmology, 26,354 in ear, nose and
throat, 25,181 in general surgery, and 12,715 in dermatology.

Is that the whole picture?
The published figures tell only part of the story. GPs have made fewer referrals for
treatment. Total monthly referrals fell from 109,432 in February 2020 to 39,076 in
April 2020, and were only 82,647 in February 2021. The Fifth Senedd’s Health, Social
Care and Sport (HSCS) Committee inquiry into the impact of COVID-19 on health
and social care heard concerns around potential “pent-up demand”, including
people with existing chronic conditions who needed ongoing support and
assessment. Cardiff and the Vale UHB stated that:

49

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

For most services the lack of referrals is unlikely to reflect a change in
the true health needs of the population - more likely the demand has
simply been supressed by the pandemic. As the pandemic recedes it is
reasonable to assume this demand will resurface.
There are particular concerns around falling numbers of cancer referrals. Dr
Richard Johnson of the Royal College of Surgeons told the Committee that
“[t]here’s a massive unmet need in the community where patients haven’t come
forward yet and haven’t been diagnosed”. Macmillan Cancer Support estimate
that between March and November 2020, around 3,500 people could have missed
a cancer diagnosis.
A report from Community Health Councils in Wales looking at the experiences
of patients on waiting lists during the pandemic, says that many people were
reluctant to use health services, due partly to concerns around COVID-19 infection.
The impact of waiting on patients can be enormous. Not only must people on
waiting lists live with their condition for longer, they may find it getting worse. The
HSCS Committee heard that patients may need extra support or ‘prehabilitation’
before being able to begin treatment, and people referred by GPs may need a
greater level of diagnostic support.
“The effect on patients waiting for surgery, even if it’s just planned surgery, is quite
devastating both from a physical and a psychological point of view”, according to
the Royal College of Surgeons.

How will the NHS in Wales deal with the backlog?
The Chief Executive of NHS Wales has stressed that reducing waiting times
needs major changes in patient care, “making sure that we don’t just revert to our
traditional services”. The Welsh NHS Confederation also acknowledge the need to
“radically rethink” the way healthcare is delivered, including:

 substantially increased use of digital technologies in providing accessible care.
Greater use of virtual GP and out-patient consultations is perhaps the most
significant service change which emerged during the pandemic;

 supporting patients as partners in managing their own care, with access to
better information and advice on their health;

50

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

 more team working across primary care and hospitals, including more and
better organised support for people with chronic conditions;

 increased support for GPs and primary care, such as more direct GP access to
diagnostic services; and

 providing some services more regionally, with health boards working together
in areas such as diagnostics and less complex, high-volume surgery.

What are the barriers to tackling waiting lists?
The Committee heard from health boards and professional bodies about issues
that must be addressed in tackling the backlog. These include the continuing
impact of the pandemic on service demand and capacity, with hospitals needing
to separate COVID and non-COVID treatment. There’s also a need for improved
scaling up of innovation. The Wales Audit Office, alongside other evaluation
work, has been critical of NHS Wales’ record in rolling out successful good practice;
Staff need time to recover and recuperate, there needs to be an increase in the
workforce, and access to more service capacity, in both the NHS and independent
sector. This will all need additional funding.

What could the new Welsh Government do?
The waiting times figures are daunting. The then Minister for Health and Social
Services, Vaughan Gething, said on 24 February 2021 that he believed the recovery
will take at least a full Senedd term.
These pressures aren’t unique to Wales. The Nuffield Trust report that waiting
lists in England are at their highest point since August 2007, and the NHS
Confederation estimates that NHS England faces a “hidden waiting list” of nearly
six million people who haven’t used health services or been referred. Public
Health Scotland reported that, in December 2020, almost 40% (34,456) of
patients had waited over 39 weeks for treatment, with lengthy waiting times for
out-patient appointments as well.
Recovering from the pandemic involves clearing the existing backlog, and keeping
up with demand from new patients added to waiting lists. The previous Welsh

51

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

Government recently published a recovery plan for health and social care. This
proposed changes in outpatient services, with virtual appointments and direct GP
access to tests becoming normal practice, to reduce referrals to hospital services. It
also recognised the need for additional service capacity.
NHS activity remains constrained by COVID-19 restrictions and the need to retain
capacity to deal with further outbreaks. Waiting times were increasing before the
pandemic. Radical action may be required by the new Welsh Government if it
wants current waiting lists not just to stabilise, but to shrink.

Recovering f rom the “biggest economic
challenge in living memory”
The last year has been the toughest economic period of many
people’s lives. What are the challenges and opportunities
for securing economic recovery and reshaping the Welsh
economy?
Gareth Thomas
The Welsh economy has faced unprecedented challenges since the start of the
COVID-19 pandemic.
At the start of 2020, who would have foreseen that many key economic sectors
would have closed for some or all of the past year? Or that the Welsh and UK
governments would spend billions supporting businesses and workers through
the most difficult period of many people’s lifetimes?
The Fifth Senedd’s Economy, Infrastructure and Skills (EIS) Committee concluded
that economic recovery will be the “biggest economic challenge in living
memory”.

What’s the scale of the challenge?
Key economic indicators show the impact of the pandemic on the Welsh economy.
Welsh Gross Domestic Product decreased by 2.4% in the first quarter of 2020, and
by 15.1% in the second quarter.
The number of payrolled employees in Wales in February 2021 was 24,000 lower
than at the start of the pandemic, with much of this decrease having come in the
early months of the pandemic.
However, the claimant count in January 2021 is almost double the level seen at
the start of 2020. Some of this increase will be caused by changes to Universal
Credit eligibility. The claimant count is the number of people receiving Jobseeker’s
Allowance, or who receive Universal Credit and are required to look for work.

Over 460,000 jobs have been furloughed in Wales since the start of the
Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, and there’s concern from the Resolution
Foundation that unemployment will spike when it eventually ends. Monthly data
has been available since July 2020, and the latest figures show that 13% of the
workforce was furloughed at the end of February 2021.

While the Office for Budget Responsibility’s latest forecast predicts a quicker
recovery than initially thought, the National Institute of Economic and Social
Research projects that recovery will be fastest in London and southern England.
It suggests that Welsh employment will recover over the next three years, but that
Welsh Gross Value Added and productivity at the end of 2023 will still be lower
than before the pandemic.

What are the challenges in supporting businesses to recover?
Some key economic sectors have been required to close for some or all of the
past year. Long-term support will be needed to help these sectors get back to full
strength – the Federation of Small Businesses Wales has pointed to the particular
needs of the tourism sector which is “facing three winters”. More detail is available
in our article on hard-hit sectors.
The recovery will also need to address underlying challenges. Wales has
historically had a lower level of business start-ups than the UK average. Professor
Dylan Jones-Evans has called for the new Welsh Government to focus more
closely on entrepreneurship as there is “overwhelming evidence that new firms
not only create the majority of new jobs in any economy but especially during a
recession”.

59

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

Wales has lower productivity than other parts of the UK, with output per hour
being 17% below the UK average in 2018. Professor Andrew Henley believes that
Wales has tended to see tackling low productivity as “too difficult a challenge to
address”, and that “in the long run, productivity is really important, and so we have
to look at how we’re going to address this challenge”. He highlights that spending
on innovation and skills will be critical, particularly to support small businesses and
microbusinesses.

What impacts on different groups will need to be addressed?
The Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics found
that previous recessions disproportionately impacted the youngest, the poorest,
and ethnic minorities. This has also been the case during the pandemic.
Young people in Wales were the most likely to work in a ‘shutdown sector’ before
the pandemic, and also to be furloughed. There’s concern that we may see a
‘scarred generation’ that experiences long-term effects of youth unemployment.
The Fifth Senedd’s EIS Committee called for the next Welsh Government to
consider introducing a Youth Opportunity Guarantee for 16-24 year olds to help
tackle youth unemployment.
The Resolution Foundation found that low-paid workers are “more likely to
have lost their job, or hours and pay, or to have been furloughed”. The Fair Work
Commission, established by the previous Welsh Government, made wideranging recommendations to deliver fair work. However, the pandemic has
added to the challenges many low-paid workers were already facing, and the
Wales Trades Union Congress has outlined further ways that it believes the next
Welsh Government should deliver fair work.
Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna’s report for the previous Welsh Government
outlined employment and income inequalities that ethnic minorities face. The
Wales Centre for Public Policy has proposed actions to address these, including
improving workplace representation and progression, tackling workplace
discrimination, and addressing the ethnicity pay gap. The previous Welsh
Government consulted on its draft Race Equality Action Plan, but it’s for the
next government to decide how to take this forward.

60

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

Redundancies in previous recessions have tended to be in sectors that mainly
employ men. However, women represent 45% of those who have been made
redundant since the start of the pandemic, compared to around a third of
those made redundant following the 2008 recession. Women have also been
more likely than men to work in a ‘shutdown sector’, and since July 2020 more
women have been furloughed than men. Chwarae Teg has called for a feminist
economic recovery, which recognises that care is as important as the production of
goods.

What opportunities are there to change how the Welsh economy
works?
Professor Gillian Bristow and Dr Adrian Healy state that building a more diverse
economy, place-based development and local ownership will build long-term
resilience to future shocks. They say that addressing long-term challenges such as
the wellbeing of future generations and shifting to a zero-carbon economy would
also build resilience.
There’s consensus around the need for a ‘green recovery’, but different views
on what this means in practice. The Confederation of British Industry Wales has
called for green infrastructure investment to be prioritised through retrofitting
homes and developing electric vehicle charging networks.
RSPB Cymru believes that a green recovery should support the natural
environment to recover and resources to be managed sustainably. The Future
Generations Commissioner has highlighted the importance of focusing widely
across a number of areas and investing in skills for new green jobs.
The previous Welsh Government sought to use the foundational economy to
“build resilience in our local economies, to create better jobs closer to home and
to build stronger local businesses”. But barriers will need to be removed to achieve
this – such as reforming procurement, and addressing low pay and insecure
working conditions.
It’s clear that there are significant short and long-term challenges facing the Welsh
economy, and that these will be particularly acute in some sectors. However, there
are also undoubted opportunities to improve the way that the economy works for
all.

61

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

There are also a number of questions to which answers will emerge over coming
years. What impact will greater remote working have on commuting and
work patterns, and how will this affect our town and city centres? What does
the future hold in terms of automation and artificial intelligence, and how might
these impact on productivity and jobs? The next Welsh Government will need to
respond to developments in these areas as well as securing economic recovery.

Supporting the recovery of hard-hit sectors
The economic impacts of the pandemic have not been
shared equally across all parts of the economy. With many
sectors still facing significant challenges, what can the new
Welsh Government do to support them?
Ben Stokes
The restrictions needed to curb the spread of COVID-19 have forced changes to
the way we live, work, socialise and spend our free time. With huge numbers of
businesses forced to close for long periods and others facing significant loss of
trade, government has stepped in to furlough staff and attempt to support whole
sections of the economy in a way never seen before.
But while this level of government support has no doubt had a significant positive
effect in safeguarding jobs, the effects of the past year and the potential need for
continued restrictions on some activities are likely to have a combined impact that
will be felt for years to come. And just like the health impacts of COVID-19 have
affected different groups of people in different ways, the economic impacts have
not been shared equally across all sectors.

Which sectors have been hit hardest by the pandemic?
Some of the hardest hit sectors are those that depend on members of the public
mixing together, indoors, in close proximity. All of which are activities that have
been either severely restricted or prohibited in law for much of the past year. For
example, the effects of these restrictions have fallen heavily on businesses and
organisations in the culture sector (such as theatres and live music venues) and
those in the non-essential retail, hospitality, leisure and tourism (NERHLT) sectors.
During lockdowns Welsh retailers have been losing £100 million a week in sales.
While overall, last year saw the worst ever retail sales figures with shopper
footfall decreasing by over 50%.
In 2020 the hospitality sector suffered a drop in sales of over 50% across
the UK. The latest available figures for Wales show economic output in the
‘accommodation and food service activities’ sector fell by 76.3% in Quarter 2 (April
to June) 2020 compared to the previous quarter.

63

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

Recent research found that around a quarter of businesses in the tourism sector
in Wales lost over 80% of their normal revenue in 2020, while over half of the
businesses in the sector have seen revenues fall by more than 60%. Highlighting
the immense challenges faced by the sector, the research reports that only 43% of
tourism businesses expect to survive for longer than the next six months.
Since March 2020, artistic performances with an audience have been prohibited in
Wales. This is in contrast to England and many other European nations who have,
at times, allowed performances to take place.
Along with restrictions that have struck at the heart of the way many cultural
activities usually operate, UK Government employment support schemes have
often not reflected the employment structure of the sector. Around half of the
80,000 creative workers in Wales are freelancers and at times these individuals
have fallen through the gaps in support. A point recognised by the previous Welsh
Government via the establishment of a Freelancer Fund.

How did the last Welsh Government support these sectors?
Since the start of the pandemic the Welsh Government has put together a support
package for businesses worth more than £2 billion. This is on top of the vast sums
that have come from the UK Government direct to businesses and individuals in
Wales via the furlough and self-employment income support schemes.
Towards the end of the Fifth Senedd the previous Welsh Government’s specific
support for NERHLT businesses and those in the supply chain, centred on
successive rounds of grants to help businesses that had closed or been materially
impacted as a result of lockdown restrictions.
In March 2021, the previous Welsh Government also announced an extension to
the existing business rates holiday for the retail, leisure and hospitality sector so
that more than 70,000 businesses in those sectors will continue to pay no rates at
all in 2021-22.
In July 2020, the previous Welsh Government announced the creation of a Cultural
Recovery Fund to provide essential support to the sector. By November 2020 over
£63 million had been allocated to the Fund. And by March 2021 the Freelancer
Fund had provided £18 million of support to 3,500 creative sector freelancers.

64

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

In March 2021, the Fifth Senedd’s Culture, Welsh Language and Communications
(CWLC) Committee heard that the Welsh Government was “hoping to receive £24
million in consequential funding” following the UK Government’s announcement
of additional support for theatres, museums and other cultural organisations in
England.
The Committee also heard from Welsh Government officials that the additional
funding announced by the UK Government “follows the road map” that it has set
out for emerging from the current lockdown in England.
This raises an important question, that also applies to other sectors. That is, if the
new Welsh Government follows a slightly different road map out of lockdown to
that of the UK Government, and chooses to re-open some sectors at a different
pace to England, how will this affect the level of financial support they will be able
to provide?

Early decisions needed f rom the new Welsh Government
After considering what Welsh Government action will be needed to support
economic recovery, the Fifth Senedd’s Economy, Infrastructure and Skills (EIS)
Committee concluded that businesses which have felt the worst effects of the
pandemic will need a “stronger and longer pandemic exit strategy than the rest of
the economy”.
Similarly the Welsh Retail Consortium has stressed that the new Welsh
Government “will need to make brave and bold choices” to help the retail sector
“weather the storm”.
In policy terms, phrases like ‘brave and bold’ and ‘stronger and longer’ usually
translate in practice to mean one thing: ‘expensive’. Other sectors, such as
aerospace, manufacturing and steel, will no doubt also be looking for the new
Welsh Government to bring forward interventions in the coming year that could
be described in a similar way.
The new Welsh Government will have difficult choices to make in terms of where
it prioritises any future support. The previous Welsh Government took 18 months
after the last election before it set out its new approach to business support. The
new Welsh Government however won’t have the same luxury of time. It will need
to make these decisions very early on - pretty much on day one of taking office.

Poverty and supporting low-income
households
Before the pandemic almost a quarter of people in Wales
lived in poverty. The past year has hit the poorest the hardest,
so how can the next Welsh Government address this?
Gareth Thomas
Tackling poverty has been a perennial challenge for successive Welsh Governments,
and will continue to be with the pandemic having exacerbated existing inequalities.
The Fifth Senedd’s Equality, Local Government and Communities (ELGC) Committee
concluded that during the pandemic poverty has been a key factor in determining
how likely people are to lose their jobs or income, fall behind in their education, and
even how likely they are to die from COVID-19..
The Institute for Fiscal Studies warned that the slowdown in the economy will
“undoubtedly have a large negative impact on household incomes over the
coming years” as workers lose their jobs, and earnings fall.

What is poverty?
A person is considered to be in poverty if their household income falls below
60% of the UK median (which is the middle value in a list of numbers that have
been arranged from smallest to largest).
The median weekly household income in the UK is £476 after housing costs,
and 60% of this is around £286.

Poverty trends before the pandemic
Poverty has remained stubbornly high over recent years, with Wales having the
highest poverty rate of the UK nations prior to the pandemic. Children are more
likely than other age groups to be in poverty, with 31% living in poverty – the only
age group to see an increase in the latest figures. Chwarae Teg noted that women
and single parents are also more likely to be in poverty.

67

In April 2020 wages in Wales were lower than in all other parts of the UK except
for Northern Ireland and North East England, contributing to the relatively high
levels of in-work poverty identified by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. People
working full-time in every Welsh local authority had median weekly pay lower than
the UK average.

At the start of the pandemic, 22% of those working in Wales earned less per hour
than the ‘real’ Living Wage with part-time workers and women particularly likely to
do so. Many workers in key sectors such as social care and food retail earn less than
the Living Wage, with the Resolution Foundation highlighting that this is the case
for over half of frontline care workers.

The impact of the pandemic on low-income households
People from low-income households have been most likely to lose their jobs,
lose income or to be furloughed since the start of the pandemic. The Resolution
Foundation found that over 40% of the lowest earners had been affected in
these ways, double the percentage of the highest earners. The Bevan Foundation
highlighted that a quarter of Welsh households have seen their income fall during
the pandemic, while at the same time living costs have increased for more than
four in ten households.

69

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

Consequently, the number of people claiming social security benefits which
support those on low incomes has increased considerably. In February 2021 over
125,000 more people in Wales were claiming Universal Credit than at the start
of the pandemic, with much of this increase happening between March and May
2020. The UK Government has temporarily increased Universal Credit by £20 per
week until the end of September 2021, however it is unclear what will happen after
this.

There have been almost 160,000 COVID-related payments through the Welsh
Government’s Discretionary Assistance Fund since the start of the pandemic.
The number of payments was at its highest in February 2021 – mainly due to
people stopping or reducing work, delays to benefit claims or increased costs
of living. Given that the fund has been considerably scaled up, the next Welsh
Government will need to consider its future role.

70

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

Debt is likely to become a bigger problem in the coming months, as support
schemes and eviction bans come to an end. Citizens Advice Cymru estimated
that people in Wales have built up £73 million worth of household bill arrears
during the pandemic, with the largest sources of arrears being rent and council
tax. The Bevan Foundation found that low income households have been
most likely to borrow during the pandemic, with over a quarter of the poorest
households having borrowed from friends and family or gone into their overdraft.
The Bevan Foundation also found that more than a quarter of low income
households have responded to difficult financial circumstances by cutting back
on spending on food for adults. Food banks and the Welsh Government have
stepped in to provide additional food to people shielding and those in need.
However, with many poorer households expecting to have to make further
cutbacks in future the next Welsh Government will need to consider what action
to take to support them.

What can be done to reduce poverty within the devolution
settlement?
While Council Tax Benefit and the Discretionary Assistance Fund were devolved to
Wales as part of UK Government welfare reforms, social security is predominantly
non-devolved, with decisions being taken by the UK Government. Similarly,
employment law is not devolved meaning that there are limits to the levers the
Welsh Government can use to reduce poverty.
The Fifth Senedd’s ELGC Committee recommended that the Welsh Government
should seek full devolution of Discretionary Housing Payments and explore
the possibility of devolving other benefits, along with powers to top-up reserved
benefits and create new ones.
A range of Welsh Government schemes operate alongside the social security
system to provide assistance to people on low incomes. The Bevan Foundation
and Joseph Rowntree Foundation have both called for the next Welsh
Government to enhance these schemes to create a ‘Welsh Benefits System’. This
would provide a single point of access for people on low incomes, and prioritise
help with housing and education costs and emergency support.
To improve the economic position of those in low-paid work, the next
Welsh Government will need to consider how the Fair Work Commission’s
recommendations fit into its overall approach, and how it wishes to respond to
issues facing low-paid workers that emerged during the pandemic.

71

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

The previous Welsh Government introduced an Economic Contract with fair
work as one of its requirements for businesses seeking investment, which the
Wales TUC believes should be strengthened. FSB Wales has called for the next
government to start a business-led campaign to help firms understand how fair
work can operate alongside growing a business. The previous Welsh Government
also published a draft Social Partnership and Public Procurement Bill, which
would require the Welsh Government to set and achieve fair work objectives, and
seek to use procurement to promote fair work and well-being.
To seek to deliver better outcomes for people on lower incomes, the previous
Welsh Government introduced the Socio-Economic Duty from 31 March 2021.
This requires public bodies covered by the duty to consider how their strategic
decisions can help to reduce socio-economic inequalities by understanding
potential impacts, and consulting with those impacted by decisions. While it is
difficult to assess the impact of equality duties, this new tool has the potential to
change how public bodies make decisions.
The key question for the next Welsh Government will be how effectively it can use
these levers to help address widening inequalities resulting from the pandemic,
while operating in the context of wider UK Government policy.

Homelessness: f rom crisis to opportunity
Has the pandemic given Wales a chance to end
homelessness?
Megan Jones and Jonathan Baxter
Homelessness and rough sleeping were already high on the political agenda in the
Fifth Senedd. There was new legislation with more focus on prevention, a Senedd
committee inquiry into rough sleeping, a new homelessness strategy from the
Welsh Government and Crisis published its plan to end homelessness.
By 2019, an expert Homelessness Action Group was advising the government
and a review was commissioned of the ‘priority need’ test that determines
how much help a person who is homeless gets. A campaign for a legal right to
adequate housing was up and running. The direction of travel was clear. But it’s
the public health emergency that has speeded up the journey.

Doing things differently
£10 million of Welsh Government funding in March 2020 kickstarted the
emergency response to homelessness during the pandemic. New statutory
guidance to local authorities said people should get temporary accommodation
if they needed it, and the additional funding ensured this happened. The new
guidance was clear that local authorities should do all they could “to ensure no
one is sleeping rough”. In effect, the guidance was removing legal barriers that had
previously restricted who had the right to get help. The then Minister, Julie James,
was clear that no one should be without suitable accommodation and support.

Somewhere to ‘stay safe’
By June 2020, over 2,000 people had been moved into emergency temporary
accommodation. In addition to people who would have been considered a priority
before the pandemic, like families with children, other groups were given shelter.
So people sleeping rough or living in unsuitable, unsafe, insecure accommodation
were offered a temporary home and support. Gone was the offer of a floor to sleep
on in a night shelter or a shared room in a hostel. Having to ‘sofa surf’ was no longer
the best people could hope for.

Local authorities worked with housing associations, third sector organisations and
private landlords to help people into accommodation and to provide the support
services they needed. Working with new partners, local authorities secured selfcontained accommodation in hotels, holiday lets and student accommodation
– accommodation that would otherwise be closed commercially because of the
COVID-19 restrictions.
The initial effort to save lives appears to have paid off. Up to 26 June 2020, the
Office for National Statistics found there were no deaths registered in Wales from
COVID-19 of people who were identified as homeless. But re-housing so many
people has created huge pressures on temporary accommodation.
At the end of February 2021, just over 6,000 homeless people (including nearly
1,300 dependent children under 16) were living in temporary accommodation.

The data has not undergone the same level of quality assurance as official statistics and may be

A long-term solution
Homelessness isn’t just about housing. But increasing the supply of affordable
housing is vital to easing pressures on temporary accommodation and to
preventing homelessness in the first place. Additional affordable homes are
needed, including more social rented homes. Homes of the right size and in the
right place. Smaller homes for the many single people experiencing homeless,
along with larger homes needed for extended families. And more homes are
needed that better meet the needs of disabled people.

78

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

What is rapid rehousing?
Moving people into settled,
secure and suitable homes as
quickly as possibly as the default
solution when homelessness
cannot be prevented.

Increasing the supply of affordable housing
will take a range of national, regional and
local solutions that address the specific
needs of communities. Solutions that
can help rural communities where few
new homes are built and where there
may be local pressures from the numbers
of second homes. And community led
solutions, like co-operative models, that
can work in both rural and urban contexts.

The pandemic may have presented an opportunity to end homelessness and to
put housing at the centre of the recovery. A recovery that delivers modern, energy
efficient low-carbon affordable homes, improves existing homes in the public
and private sector and brings empty homes back into use. And all this has the
potential to provide not just homes, but jobs and training opportunities.

What does ending homelessness look like?
The previous Welsh Government established an expert group in 2019 to answer
this question. The Homelessness Action Group engaged with the sector, support
providers, academics and people with lived experience of homelessness.
The Action Group’s second and main report set a framework of policies,
approaches and plans with the aim of ending homelessness. It’s clear the group’s
work has shaped the response to the pandemic.
By July 2020 an extra £50 million had been made available by the Welsh
Government to support phase 2 of the homelessness response and the
transformation of services. The aim was to move away from a reliance on unsuitable
temporary accommodation and towards a rapid rehousing approach as called for
by the Action Group.
Highlighting the links between homelessness and wider social issues, the Action
Group’s recommendations call for universal prevention. This is based on the idea
that homelessness isn’t a stand-alone issue and that factors like poverty and a
wide range of adverse childhood experiences need to be addressed to “lay the
foundations for ending homelessness”.

79

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

It calls for prevention to be targeted at certain groups proven to be at greater risk,
such as vulnerable young people and people leaving care or prison. It also wants
the legal duty to prevent homelessness to be extended across the wider public
sector, not just placed at the door of housing services.
In the third and final report, the Action Group sets out practical
recommendations aimed at putting ‘rapid rehousing’ at the heart of the system
for tackling homelessness, building on the pandemic response. It also focuses on
partnerships needed across public services to end homelessness in a strategic,
planned way and the impact of UK policy, like welfare reform.

New challenges
The Homelessness Action Group has set out the steps it sees as necessary to
end homelessness. Will the new Welsh Government seek to implement those
recommendations through an action plan, or will it put forward alternative
proposals? Can the new government build on the achievements of the last year?
The next few months will present some major new challenges in this policy area:

 Will there be a surge in demand placed on homelessness services when the
current suspension of evictions is lifted?

 Will the full economic impact of the pandemic result in more job losses and
homelessness?

 How will local authorities manage the growing pressure on temporary
accommodation?

 Will there need to be a return to the pre-pandemic approach of rationing access
to temporary accommodation?
It’s widely recognised that homelessness and inadequate housing directly impacts
on inequalities, health, education and the life chances of current and future
generations. The challenge for the next Welsh Government is to provide the
leadership that the Homelessness Action Group says is essential to deliver the
homes, homelessness prevention and support services that are needed.

80

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

The previous Welsh Government said homelessness should be “rare, brief and
un-repeated”. This pandemic appears to have provided the best opportunity
to make that aspiration a reality. The big question is whether it can actually be
achieved during the Sixth Senedd.

Putting the ‘public’ back into public transport
Bus and rail services are having a tough time in the pandemic.
How can Welsh transport policy put them back on their feet
and why does it matter?
Andrew Minnis
The performance of bus and rail services has been a concern for years. However,
the pandemic has seen a collapse in passenger numbers and revenue. Both modes
have been on life support since last March.
Recovery of the sector will be important if Wales is to achieve some key socioeconomic and environmental priorities. Yet future demand, and even the postpandemic purpose of these transport modes, is unclear.
An effective response from policy makers and practitioners in the Sixth Senedd
will be crucial to get public transport back on the road (and rails) to recovery.

What’s happened to passenger numbers?
Public transport issues are not new. Bus passenger numbers have declined for
about a decade. In contrast, rail passengers have grown steadily, but overcrowding
and aging trains have dogged Arriva Trains Wales, and subsequently Transport
for Wales (TfW) Rail.

The pandemic’s impact has been shattering. Bus and rail passenger numbers have
collapsed. The Welsh Government has estimated that the use of public transport
declined by 95% in the early days of the pandemic compared to the same period
the year before.
Given the impact on congestion and the environment, it’s also concerning that
car usage, for Great Britain as a whole, has recovered much more rapidly than bus

adequate alternatives.

Source: Transport use during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, UK Department for
Transport
Note: The UK Department for Transport published a note on methodology for this data
outlining its limitations. Baselines differ for each mode.

Why does public transport matter?
Public transport helps address key socio-economic issues like social inclusion
and access to work. A quarter of households lack car access and the Bevan
Foundation has highlighted public transport’s role in supporting social inclusion
including for older people and those on low incomes.
Evidence to the Senedd’s Petitions Committee said one in five job offers at
Deeside Industrial Park are turned down because of poor public transport or road
congestion.
Public transport has environmental benefits. Road transport is a significant
cause of air pollution and poor air quality, so low emission buses and rail

84

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

services can improve air quality. In terms of climate change, the UK Climate
Change Committee highlights, in its latest advice report to the Welsh
Government, that surface transport more generally contributes 14% of Welsh
greenhouse gas emissions, higher per capita than for the UK as a whole. The CCC
identifies public transport and active travel as priorities for Welsh decarbonisation.

Public transport on life support
The last Welsh Government responded to the collapse in passenger numbers by
immediately putting bus and TfW Rail services on life support, with an initial round
of emergency financial support in March 2020.
Further support for rail followed last May before the Welsh Government
announced in the autumn that TfW would take rail services into public ownership
as “operator of last resort”. A move expected to last at least five years.
Initial support for bus services merged with wider reform priorities to become a
new Bus Emergency Scheme.
Bus reform
With plans for a Bus Services Bill shelved due to the pandemic, the last Welsh
Government introduced the Bus Emergency Scheme, combining emergency
funding with an increased role for local government and TfW in planning
networks.
The previous Welsh Government anticipated this increased role for
government would endure, and also continued to develop legislation for
its successor to consider. In contrast bus operators anticipate a return to a
“commercial” network, less dependent on public funding, and view legislation
as unnecessary.
Together, both modes received about £200 million of additional Welsh
Government funding in 2020-21, with more to come in 2021-22.

What’s the plan for recovery?
Many countries and cities are focusing transport recovery on sustainable mobility,
including public transport. In Wales, and more widely in Great Britain, NGOs like
Transport Focus, the Campaign for Better Transport and Transform Cymru have
published post-COVID-19 priorities supporting this approach.

85

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

The previous Welsh Government published a new Wales Transport Strategy
in March which reflects its wider post-COVID-19 reconstruction priorities. The
strategy prioritises reducing the need to travel, along with a shift from the private
car to more sustainable modes. Significantly, it includes a target to increase the
share of journeys by public transport and active travel from 32% to 45% by 2040.
Along with bus reform, the success of the three planned Metro systems will be
crucial to public transport recovery, as will plans to address M4 congestion around
Newport and new transport governance arrangements.
The future of the M4 corridor around Newport
The Burns Commission published final recommendations on alternatives
to the M4 relief road last November, focusing on public transport. Though
accepted by the last Welsh Government, these require investment in nondevolved rail infrastructure.
The UK Government has announced funding for exploratory work on
Lord Burns’ rail recommendations. However, the Prime Minister supports
a relief road, and the Secretary of State has described it as “the most
obvious” solution to congestion.

Transport governance
Corporate Joint Committees (CJCs) are being established to deliver some
Welsh local government functions regionally, including transport planning.
The last Welsh Government saw its transport body, TfW, as a “go-to”
delivery body for these CJCs. Yet local government has not always been
clear on the relationship between TfW and proposed regional transport
structures.
This relationship will be crucial to achieving the aims of the new transport
strategy and public transport recovery.

86

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

However, not all policy levers currently sit within Wales. In particular, UK
Government plans to reform rail in Great Britain could have big implications for
Wales.
Rail reform
While the Welsh Government has executive powers, rail is largely reserved.
The UK Government has overall control of the rail system, including Welsh rail
infrastructure outside the Core Valleys Network.
The last Welsh Government believed Wales has been short changed on rail
infrastructure enhancement spending, and developed a strategic case for
investment.
The UK Government announced a “root and branch” rail review in 2018
and in September last year the Secretary of State said a White Paper on the
future of rail in Great Britain was on its way within 18 months.

A new purpose for public transport?
Once the crisis point has passed, the question of what post-pandemic public
transport will look like will remain.
The previous Welsh Government highlighted uncertainty around the pandemic’s
impact on future travel demand. Public opinion surveys and work by Transport
Focus suggest a long-term change in travel habits and demand, not least if remote
working becomes more established as the previous Welsh Government intended.
The next Welsh Government’s transport policy will need to ensure bus and rail
services are able to adapt to their new purpose, if the ambitious targets in the new
transport strategy are to be retained and met.
In doing so, it will also need to address perennial issues like integration with other
modes, coordinating with trip generating policy areas like health and land-use
planning, addressing congestion and managing demand.
The new Welsh Government will have its work cut out.

Is a million Welsh speakers by 2050
achievable?
With an ambitious target to almost double the number of
Welsh speakers within a generation, is action translating into
results?
Osian Bowyer
At the start of the Fifth Senedd, the previous Welsh Government took the bold step
of announcing the ambitious goal of a million Welsh speakers by 2050. Looking to
almost double the number of Welsh speakers in Wales, it marked a dramatic shift
in policy direction.

Cymraeg 2050 – a strategy for a generation
Cymraeg 2050 – A million Welsh speakers is a strategy that spans a generation,
and has three key themes:

 increasing the number of Welsh speakers;
 increasing use of Welsh; and
 creating suitable conditions and an environment where the Welsh language and
its speakers can thrive.
The Fifth Senedd’s Culture, Welsh Language and Communications (CWLC)
Committee found widespread support for the 2050 target and the aims within
the strategy to achieve it. It noted that for the strategy to succeed, “considerable
additional resources and clear targets” would be needed.

Are the numbers heading in the right direction?
The previous Welsh Government didn’t shy away from the central role the
education system would play in creating the bulk of new Welsh speakers. After all,
the Welsh Language Use Survey 2013-15 found that 4 out of 5 children aged 3 to
15 mainly learnt Welsh at school or nursery.

89

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

The strategy set challenging targets for the long and short-term. These include
increasing the proportion of learners in Welsh-medium education and increasing
the number of teachers able to teach through the medium of Welsh. The data
shows limited progress to date – while the number of secondary school teachers
able to teach in Welsh remained broadly consistent between 2016 and 2020, the
number of primary school teachers able to teach in Welsh has declined slightly.

There’s been better progress on the goal to create 40 new Cylchoedd Meithrin
(Welsh-medium playgroups) by 2021. The previous Welsh language Minister,
Eluned Morgan, said in February 2021 that “by the end of this year [2021], we hope
to have established 46 [Cylchoedd Meithrin], so we will have exceeded that target”.
Side-by-side with the increase in the number of Cylchoedd Meithrin is an increase
in the number of children attending them – 10,724 in 2015-16 and 11,544 in 2019-20.
There’s also a positive trend in the percentage of children moving from early-years
settings into Welsh-medium primary schools (86% 2015-16 to 90% 2018-19). These
are small gains however, and won’t by themselves achieve the inroads Cymraeg
2050 seeks to make.
At the other end of the educational spectrum, the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol
(the Coleg Cymraeg) has rapidly built-up Welsh-medium provision within
universities, providing more opportunities for students to study in Welsh. It now
seeks to do the same in the post-16 sector. The Coleg Cymraeg notes in its Further
Education and Apprenticeship Welsh-medium Action Plan that this sector “has
not had the same strategic focus or investment compared with, for example, the
Higher Education sector”.

91

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

Following calls for investment to develop post-16 Welsh-medium provision, the
previous Welsh Government provided the Coleg Cymraeg with an additional
£800,000 for 2021-22. Future investment will likely be required if Cymraeg 2050
targets are to be met.

What about day-to-day use of Welsh?
Cymraeg 2050 sets out to double the percentage of people that speak Welsh
on a daily basis from 10% (Welsh Language Use Survey 2013-15 data) to 20% by
2050. Increasing usage could be far more influential to language growth than the
numbers that speak it. For a language to thrive, it must be used on a regular basis –
whether that is in the home, the office, in the local shop, or with friends in the pub.
Providing spaces and opportunities for people to use Welsh, particularly within
their local area and workplace is central to its viability and growth. Helping
the network of organisations that support and promote the language within
communities has never been more critical.
The pandemic has had a significant impact on the work of this network. The
effects of COVID-19 on Welsh language community groups survey found that
the vast majority (68%) of regular activities had ceased after the first lockdown
was announced in March 2020. Some adapted their activities to digital formats,
providing opportunities to engage differently with participants, and reach out to a
wider audience.

Supporting the language to grow?
Various interventions, resources and innovations are needed to help those learning
the language and encourage its daily use. These can range from policies that
support jobs growth in Welsh speaking communities to the development of
the translation profession. The previous Welsh Government’s Welsh Language
Technology Action Plan supports innovative technology developments to assist
and enable people to live their lives through the medium of Welsh.
There’s also been investment in developing artificial intelligence to allow Welsh to
be used with ‘bots’, for example. The hope is that in future, Welsh speakers will be
able to use Welsh with their voice assistants, such as Siri and Alexa.
In March 2021, the previous Welsh Government launched a consultation on a
National policy on Welsh linguistic infrastructure. The proposals seek to
coordinate and make it easier for people to use Welsh language resources. This

92

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

may include developing dictionaries and terminology, or creating a central portal
to access them. How that’s taken forward will very much depend on the new
Welsh Government.

Will mainstreaming the language help?
For Cymraeg 2050 to succeed, it will require the new Welsh Government to embed
the Welsh language across all policy portfolios. One criticism consistently raised
during the Fifth Senedd was that the Welsh Government’s Welsh Language Unit
lacks ‘clout’ within the civil service. The Fifth Senedd’s CWLC Committee inquiry on
Supporting and Promoting the Language recommended that:
The Welsh Government should move to enhance the status and role
of the Welsh Language Unit... The Unit should also have an increased
cross-governmental role, ensuring internal arrangements for effective
implementation of Cymraeg 2050 is undertaken across government
departments.
There’s also debate as to where national oversight of Welsh language policy should
sit within the Welsh Government. As the previous Minister noted during scrutiny:
I would suggest that actually, rather than just holding me to account
when it comes to the budget… that actually you ask the other Ministers,
who’ve got huge amounts of money, what they’re doing within their
budgets in relation to the Welsh language.
The Welsh Language Budget that specifically supports and promotes the language
is currently a modest £38 million, dwarfed in comparison to other departmental
budgets. Cymdeithas yr Iaith has long called for the Welsh Government to commit
1% of its total budget to promote the language. The figure for 2021-22 stands at
0.19%.

All eyes turn to the 2021 Census!
Language planning is complex. It requires systematic and innovative approaches,
resources and most importantly, harnessing the continued support of the people of
Wales.
All eyes will soon turn to the Census 2021, which is considered the authoritative
source of data on the number of Welsh speakers in Wales. The Census is the
yardstick that will be used to establish progress on Cymraeg 2050 targets over the
next few decades. Along with data from the Welsh Language Use Survey, the

93

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

National Survey for Wales and the Annual Population Survey, it will provide the
next Welsh Government with critical data on the health of the language.
If the Census 2021 data shows an increase in the number of Welsh speakers, it will
provide some vindication for the ambition and targets set in Cymraeg 2050. A
decrease will only intensify pressure on the next Welsh Government to consider a
different approach.

Back to school: education in the time of
COVID
Even before pupils’ coats are back on their school pegs,
the pressure is already on the education system to deliver
significantly more. Concerns that we don’t stigmatise children
mean that talk about a ‘lost generation’ needing to ’catchup’ is already out of favour. Yet the inescapable reality is that
months of face to face learning have been missed.
Our learners have been part of the pandemic’s “collateral
damage” While at this stage there are more questions than
answers, the solutions will need to be carefully considered and
delivered during the Sixth Senedd.
Siân Thomas

The state of play pre-pandemic
Arguably, Wales was already facing an uphill struggle to secure good educational
outcomes for all its learners. A decade after the then Welsh Government recognised
that the education system had showed “evidence of systemic failure”, there was a
collective holding of breath when Wales’ 2018 PISA results were announced.
Following extra funding and a national action plan to deliver change, the 2018
PISA scores were seen as a much needed sign of some progress. Wales’ scores
were no longer statistically significantly different to the OECD average in each of
three main domains (reading, mathematics and science), although they remained
the lowest of the UK nations. Then Education Minister, Kirsty Williams, described
them as “positive, not perfect”.

The most disadvantaged learners have extra challenges which can prevent them
from achieving their full potential. Even though the previous Welsh Government
invested £585 million since 2012 through the Pupil Development Grant (PDG ),
the attainment gap it was seeking to close didn’t narrow. It also typically widens
as learners get older. There’s a stark difference between children eligible for free
school meals and their peers at Key Stage 4, the two years where learners usually
take GCSEs and other examinations.

The extent to which the pandemic has affected learners
Children and young people themselves are well placed to give their verdict. A 2021
Children’s Commissioner survey of 20,000 children found that 35% didn’t feel
confident about their learning, compared to 25% in May 2020. 63% of 12-18 year
olds were worried about falling behind.
There are countless reports setting out adults’ views about how missing more
than half a year of ‘face to face’ schooling has affected learners. One of the major
concerns has been the variation between what schools have been delivering to
pupils.
There’s a long list of potential impacts:

 ‘lost learning’ meaning pupils could underperform academically and have their
long term prospects affected;

 a loss of confidence in the examination and assessment system;

100

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

 long term reductions in school attendance, a factor which we know is key to
educational outcomes;

 difficult transitions between school years and from primary to secondary;
 challenges in re-engaging learners and addressing low motivation;
 an unhelpful ‘catch up’ narrative about lost learning placing unnecessary
psychological pressure on children and young people; and

 a negative effect on learners’ ability and confidence to communicate in Welsh
where they haven’t been able to do so at home.
As well as these obvious educational issues there are wider predicted effects.
Current learners could earn less, with one estimate of up to £40,000 in a lifetime.
The harm to children’s physical health and a higher prevalence of mental health
issues, including anxiety and depression, are also serious concerns.
The pandemic’s wider economic impact is also likely to increase the number of
children living in low income families. Again, it’s the most disadvantaged learners
who are predicted to bear the brunt in the longer term. For example, in March
2021, the Child Poverty Action Group found that 35% of low-income families
responding to its UK wide survey were still without essential resources for
learning, with laptops and devices most commonly missing. The Fifth Senedd’s
Children, Young People and Education (CYPE) Committee heard that there is
“plenty of evidence” that ”there are striking differences between families in terms
of their ability to support young people in their learning: the resources they have
around them, the enthusiasm, the engagement, the commitment”.
There may also be work to be done to rebuild relationships which have been under
significant strain during the past 12 months. Those between teaching unions and
the decision-makers within the education system; between parents/carers and
schools; and perhaps, most importantly, re-establishing the relationship between
learners and their teachers.

Immediate and longer term solutions?
Some of the immediate solutions which are already on the table or up for
discussion are: more money, including the ‘Recruit, Recover and Raise Standards
funding’; more teachers and learning assistants on the ground; changing term
times; and setting up summer schools, holiday clubs and home tuition.

101

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

However, in the longer term, there may be more questions than answers about
the way forward, such as:

 How to ditch the ‘deficit model’? Placing the onus on the education system to
support learners rather than pressurising learners to catch up.

 Whether a long term is strategy needed to coordinate the range of possible
solutions? What’s the future role of schools, local authorities, regional consortia
and the Welsh Government in this? Who should be in charge of this long term
approach? Should Wales should appoint an Education Tsar, as in England?

 Are schools being properly funded? One estimate places the cost of Wales’
journey back from COVID-19 at £1.4 billion.

 Can international examples and historical experiences help identify ways of
dealing with such major interruptions to education? One academic has already
suggested that “disruption can lead to positive change if you’re willing to
make the effort”.

 To what extent is the current education system fit for purpose? Is now the
‘watershed moment’ and time for a complete rethink?

Major reforms to deliver: mental health, the curriculum and
additional learning needs
Children and young people’s return to the classroom has been heralded as the
big chance to put their well-being at the heart of education. As well as having a
positive impact on well-being, put simply, mentally healthy children are much more
likely to learn.
Following pressure from the Fifth Senedd’s CYPE Committee and its
stakeholders, Wales has already made a significant shift towards establishing
a ‘Whole School Approach to Mental Health’. The challenge during the Sixth
Senedd will be to deliver it.
The potential sting in the tail is that, at the exact same time the education system
is getting children back to school, it also has to contend with major legislative
reform. This is in the form of wholesale changes to both the school curriculum and
support for learners with Additional Learning Needs.

102

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

Some may argue that there’s been no better time to have such significant
changes. If the education system can successfully implement these three major
reforms then arguably Wales has done some significant leg work to be on a firmer
footing to meet the challenges that COVID-19 has presented.

More questions than answers?
At this stage there may be many more questions than answers for the education
system. The world into which learners will move has changed forever. Not only
has the pandemic interrupted their schooling, but the future journeys they were
expected to make into the workplace or further and higher education may be
unrecognisable. The skills and aptitudes needed in the ‘new normal’ are only now
beginning to be identified and are likely to be different from those needed before
the pandemic began.
COVID-19 has made its unforgettable mark on the world. Perhaps the biggest
question of all is how radical the response of Wales’ education system should be.

Skills: a road to prosperity
Skills are critical to making Wales a more prosperous nation.
But raising qualification levels in the population is not enough.
There are other challenges that must be overcome, such as
stimulating employer demand for higher level skills.
Phil Boshier
Skills are a key factor in improving productivity and pay, both of which drive
economic growth and higher living standards.
Since 2008, qualification levels among the working age population in Wales have
risen substantially
Yet, Wales - like the UK - is in the midst of an entrenched productivity problem,
with parts of the nation trapped in “a cycle of low-skill, low-wage and lowproductivity”.
‘Sluggish’ productivity alongside increasing qualification levels shows that any
relationship between skills and prosperity is not a simple one.
Some of the challenges that will face the new Welsh Government include the
need to consider employer demand for skills, getting the content of qualifications
right, and the take-up and provision of lifelong learning.

Qualif ication levels may outstrip employer demand for them
The supply of qualifications into the labour market is likely to carry on growing, but
demand for high level skills from employers may not keep pace.
One study projects that:
The supply of highly qualified people will grow more quickly than
demand for such qualifications.
This is already happening in Wales where qualifications levels between 2004 and
2018 rose fastest in the lowest skilled occupations, with the over-qualification rate
hovering at around 40% in the decade to 2017.

104

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

There is also considerable debate over the impact of automation and technology
on certain jobs. New occupations could be created and current ones made
redundant or considerably changed. But some experts urge caution against:
[assuming] the introduction of new technologies will automatically raise
the demand for more skilled workers, increase productivity or reduce
income inequality in Wales

Employers aren’t always interested in highly skilled workers
Many enterprises are profitable without a highly-skilled workforce. This means
many workers in Wales work in a ‘low-skills equilibrium’ where low demand for
high level skills from employers mean there is little requirement or incentivisation
for workers to gain higher level skills.
While these firms can be profitable, low-skills equilibriums are associated with
poorer personal outcomes and lower pay for their workers.
However, just increasing the supply of highly skilled workers is not enough, it can
just mean employers do not fully utilise those skills. The OECD explains that:
having skills is not enough; to achieve growth, both for a country but also
for an individual, skills must be put to productive use at work
The policy implication is that the supply of skills into the labour market, and
employer demand for higher level skills, must be considered at the same time.

Mismatches between skill supply and skill demand have negative
consequences
Low-skills equilibriums are just one outcome from the interaction between skill
supply and skill demand.

105

Outcomes from interactions between skills supply and employer demand

geographies .

Mismatched supply and demand can result in skills shortages and skills surpluses.
While some level of skills mismatching is normal in a dynamic economy, it can:
slow the adoption of new technologies, cause delays in production,
increase labour turnover and reduce productivity.
There are three approaches to trying to align skills with demand:

 Learner preference: where providers adjust their curriculums to match the
demand of learners. This is arguably the model operated in the UK higher
education sector.

 Central planning: where a central or regional body gathers data and labour
market intelligence to forecast employer skills demand so skills provision can be
centrally planned. This is the basis of the Regional Skills Partnership model used
in Wales.

106

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

 Market determination: where learners are free to choose their programmes,
but the programmes on offer are driven by employer demand, like the
apprenticeship programme.
The Employer Skills Survey sets out an understanding of skill mismatches in
Wales.

Education participation falls with age, and part-time learning
numbers continue to fall
A UK Government Office for Science report contends that:
Collectively [changes to employment patterns] point to lifelong learning
as the pathway for skills-driven economic growth, building on the
skills that individuals have when they leave the education system, and
enabling workers to adapt to changing demands for skills.
But the data paints a challenging picture.
In general, participation in education and skills training falls significantly with age
with the overall number of learners in further and higher education, and workbased learning falling substantially from aged 40 onwards.
In 2019, over three-quarters of 16-18 year olds were in education or training. This
falls to just over a third of 19-24 year olds (largely made-up of higher education
students) and drops further among 25-30 year olds to just over 10%.
At the same time, there has been a significant trend of falling part-time learning in
higher and further education, and adult-community education.
While recent reforms to part-time higher education student support appear to have
stimulated an increase in higher education part-time learning, further analysis
shows that this increase has been driven by The Open University. This suggests
that the fall in part-time learning in higher education at least, presents a complex
problem for policymakers, which goes beyond just the financial support available.

107

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

Trend in part-time learners in Wales

Employers are a key source of lifelong learning. Yet while the proportion of Welsh
workers receiving training in the workplace has increased, the intensity of training
has fallen. On top of this, the picture is not an even one, with one analysis showing
that:
Women, younger people, those with higher qualifications, occupants
of higher skilled jobs and those who work in the public sector are the
strongest beneficiaries [of work-place training].

Some argue current skills qualif ications do not prepare learners
for change
An ongoing debate in skills policy is what attributes courses should develop in
learners.
Should skills provision focus on preparing learners for specific job-related tasks, or
be a broader offering, with more emphasis on general education and ‘soft skills’
that employers are known to value?

108

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

Arguing against what it sees as the status quo, a Colegau Cymru commissioned
report contends that there is too little general education in UK vocational
qualifications:
Unlike school and university, much of Further Education is concerned
with immediately relevant competencies. […] In place of competencies
it is important vocational education builds on the broader notion of
capability – giving all citizens capacity to adapt rapidly to changing
circumstances.

The challenges ahead
Skills are one key road to making Wales more prosperous. But while qualification
levels in Wales have risen, the new Welsh Government will face other deeper
challenges if it is to ensure the skills system fulfils its potential to improve the
prosperity of Wales.

Implementing major education reforms
The current national curriculum and arrangements for
meeting pupils’ Additional Learning Needs are “no longer fit
for purpose”. Both were subject to major legislation in the
previous Senedd and implementing these reforms, while
recovering from the pandemic, is therefore likely to be among
the top education priorities for the new Welsh Government.
Michael Dauncey
The new Welsh Government’s top education priorities – second only to recovering
from the disruption caused by COVID-19 – are likely to be delivering on two laws
passed in the previous Senedd:

 the Curriculum and Assessment (Wales) Act 2021, and
 the Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018.
These Acts respectively change how and what all three to 16 year olds are taught,
and how over a fifth of pupils are supported with their learning difficulties.

A purpose-led Curriculum for Wales
The national curriculum, which was introduced in England and Wales in 1988,
has already been adapted under devolution. The most notable change was the
introduction of the Foundation Phase in 2010, in place of Key Stage 1. However, the
Curriculum and Assessment (Wales) Act 2021 marks the beginning of a distinct
Welsh curriculum. And it’s a big change, covering not only what’s taught but how
it’s taught.
The new age 3-16 Curriculum for Wales moves away from a heavily prescribed
national curriculum, which the last Welsh Government said is “no longer fit
for purpose”. Professor Graham Donaldson’s ‘Successful Futures’ review (2015)
identified a need for change, not just to support Wales’ mission to improve
school standards but to give young people what they need for a vastly different
world to the one of 1988. He also said too much prescription and detail inhibits the
responsiveness of the curriculum to social, economic and technological changes.

110

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

The new curriculum is therefore intended to be purpose-led rather than contentbased, with a greater emphasis on skills and teaching what matters. Schools
will have the flexibility to design their own curriculum, within a broad national
framework provided by the Act and associated codes and guidance.
As highlighted during scrutiny, the education sector will have to strike a delicate
balance in delivering school-level curricula that remain similar enough so that all
pupils receive equal experiences across all schools in Wales.
The curriculum will be structured around four purposes, six Areas of Learning and
Experience (AoLEs) and three cross-curricular skills. Schools’ curricula will also
need to be suitable, broad and balanced, enabling pupils to make appropriate
progression. English, Welsh, Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) and
Religion, Values and Ethics (RVE) will be mandatory elements. Remaining details
will be set out in statutory codes and guidance.
The last Welsh Government published the provisional Curriculum for Wales
in January 2020. Following the Senedd’s passing of the legislation in March
2021, the new Welsh Government is expected to formally make this the statutory
curriculum in all maintained (that is, publicly funded) schools.

When will the Curriculum for Wales be introduced?
The last Welsh Government published an implementation plan for the new
curriculum in January 2021. Rather than a ‘big bang’ approach, it intended for it to
be introduced in phases.
The Curriculum for Wales will be introduced in September 2022 in early years,
primary school and Year 7 (usually the first year of secondary school). It will then be
rolled out to subsequent year groups as these pupils progress through school, until
they reach Year 11 in 2026/27.
The previous Minister said during scrutiny of the legislation that the timetable is
unchanged by COVID-19 but will be kept under review.

Additional Learning Needs: reform affecting over one in f ive
learners
The last Welsh Government described the Additional Learning Needs and
Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 as a “complete overhaul” of a system “no
longer fit for purpose”. Weaknesses of the current system, identified in previous
reviews dating back many years, include families often having to battle to secure
provision for their child, insufficient joint working between local government and
health, and inconsistencies in how different learners’ needs are met.
Currently, around 100,000 pupils (21%) are recognised as having “Special
Educational Needs” (SEN), or “Additional Learning Needs” (ALN) as they will be
called under the new system. This means they:

 have a significantly greater difficulty in learning than the majority of others of the
same age (that can’t be addressed solely through differentiated teaching), or

 a disability (for the purposes of the Equality Act 2010) which prevents or hinders
them accessing education or training that’s generally provided for others of the
same age, and

 the learning difficulty or disability calls for Additional Learning Provision (ALP).

112

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

Pupils currently have their SEN met under three levels of support, depending on
how severe and complex their needs are. Only ‘Statements of SEN’, which are issued
by the local authority and set out what provision is needed to meet the learner’s
needs, are legally enforceable.
The 2018 Act has three main aims:

 a single system for children from birth, pupils in schools and students in colleges,
regardless of level of need. Each learner with ALN will be given a statutory
‘Individual Development Plan’ (IDP);

 closer collaboration between the NHS and local government through a
designated liaison officer within each health board, and

 a more transparent system to avoid disagreement and resolve disputes.
When will the new ALN system start?
The previous Education Minister, Kirsty Williams, confirmed in February 2021 the
plan to implement the new ALN system over a three-year period from September
2021. In March, the Senedd voted to approve the ALN Code which the last Welsh
Government described as an “operational handbook” for how the new system will
work in practice.
From September 2021, all learners newly identified as having ALN will come under
the new system. Pupils who already have SEN will transition across, between 2021
and 2024, starting with those who have low to moderate needs. Those with more
severe or complex needs (who currently have statements of SEN) will move to
the new system later in the three-year period. The timing will also depend on the
pupil’s year group.
By the end of 2023/24, all pupils with ALN are scheduled to have moved over to the
new system.

What might prevent the reforms being delivered successfully?
The insufficiency and complexity of school funding was highlighted throughout
the last Senedd. The Children, Young People and Education (CYPE) Committee
found in its 2019 inquiry that not enough money was reaching schools and in its
final report of the previous Senedd called for resources to be distributed to schools
more effectively – especially given the scale of reform schools are now expected to
deliver.
The previous Welsh Government allocated £20 million to be spread over four
years to its ’ALN Transformation Programme’. It also said it would respond
to the recommendations of the Sibieta review on school funding. These
recommendations include keeping the new ALN system under continual review
to ensure it’s implemented as intended, as well as the possible need for additional
funding.
Applying the new flexibility to deliver school-level curricula will also require a
culture change among a profession used to teaching a prescribed national
curriculum for over thirty years. The previous Welsh Government planned to
allocate £15 million per year until 2025-26 for ’professional learning’ to enable the
education workforce to deliver the new curriculum. Estyn, the schools inspectorate,
is also visiting schools to help them prepare.
As for COVID-19, some stakeholders, for example the teaching union NASUWT,
believe the impact of the pandemic means the new curriculum should be delayed.
Others, for example Estyn, have said the way schools have had to innovate during
the pandemic could make them better placed to deliver the Curriculum for Wales.
Moving into the Sixth Senedd, both the backdrop of COVID-19 and the longstanding imperative of raising educational standards will loom large over a
government and education sector tasked with implementing major reforms.

Climate change: the path to zero emissions
With a target of net-zero emissions by 2050 now in law, does
Wales have the commitment, legislation and policy in place to
achieve this?
Chloe Corbyn
In 2019 the Welsh Government declared a climate emergency. Speaking at the
time, the Environment Minister Lesley Griffiths, said:
We hope that the declaration by Welsh Government today can help
to trigger a wave of action at home and internationally. From our
own communities, businesses and organisations to parliaments and
governments around the world.
But what has the declaration meant for the scale and pace of action to tackle
climate change? Have emissions reduced across all sectors? And how should recent
changes to our climate change legislation be translated into action if we are to
meet our ambitious targets?

Global context
In late 2015, the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (COP21) took place in Paris. The meeting was
hailed as a make-or-break opportunity to secure an international agreement
on approaches to tackling climate change. The subsequent landmark ‘Paris
Agreement’ aimed to limit global warming to less than 20C above pre-industrial
levels, and preferably keep it below 1.50C.
In 2019, prior to the pandemic, the estimated global emissions for 2030 were not
expected to achieve the Paris Agreement’s goal. Instead, emissions were expected
to reach around 30C above pre-industrial levels. Global climate ambition has
subsequently increased, with major economies such as China, Japan and South
Korea declaring net-zero objectives, and the new US administration expected to
re-join the Paris Agreement.
While Wales, along with the other countries of the UK, is not a signatory to the
Paris Agreement, the UK as a whole is. As a significant contributor to UK emissions
– particularly in the industry and agriculture sectors - Wales’ contribution is crucial
to UK climate leadership and action on the global stage.

120

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

The UK will host the next United Nations climate talks – the 26th Conference of
the Parties (COP 26) – in Glasgow in November 2021. Originally scheduled for
November 2020, COP 26 heralds a key moment in efforts to raise global climate
ambition. Countries are expected to resubmit their Nationally Determined
Contributions (NDCs) for emissions reduction to 2030.

A f ramework for action
The Environment (Wales) Act 2016 marked a step change in Wales’ approach to
tackling climate change. Progressing from an annual (non-statutory) target of a
3% year-on-year reduction, the Act placed new duties on the Welsh Government
to ensure greenhouse gas emissions reduce. It also introduced a carbon budgeting
method to measure progress towards reducing emissions.
The Act set a target for an 80% reduction in emissions by 2050 and a duty to set
interim targets for 2020, 2030 and 2040. Following advice from the UK Climate
Change Committee (CCC) in April and December 2017, the interim emissions
targets and first two carbon budgets were set in regulations in December 2018.
In March 2019, the Welsh Government published Prosperity for All: A low carbon
Wales. This low carbon delivery plan set out how Wales aimed to meet the first
carbon budget (2016-2020) and the 2020 interim target through 100 policies and
proposals across Ministerial portfolios.
In 2019 the CCC advised the Welsh
Government to amend its 2050 target and
reduce emissions by 95% by that date. The
Welsh Government accepted this advice
and declared its ambition to achieve netzero by 2050. Revised advice from the
CCC in December 2020 recommended
that Wales should set and pursue the more
ambitious net-zero by 2050 target.
In February 2021 the Welsh Government
laid four further sets of regulations. These:

What does net-zero mean?
Net-zero means that total
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
would be equal to or less than
the emissions removed from
the environment. This can be
achieved by a combination of
emission reduction and emission
removal.

 amended the 2050 emissions target to net-zero;
 increased the 2030 target to 63% (from 45%) and the 2040 target to 89% (from
67%); and

121

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

 set the third carbon budget (2026-2030).
Progress to date
Emissions of greenhouse gases in Wales have fallen by 31% since 1990. The most
recent data shows that Welsh emissions fell by 8% in 2018, and between 2016 and
2018 they reduced by close to 20%. As things stand, it looks like Wales is on track
to meet its 2020 emissions target of a 27% reduction against the 1990 baseline, as
long as emissions didn’t increase in 2019 and 2020. This won’t be confirmed until
the data is available later this year.
The fall in total emissions over recent years has not been distributed evenly across
all sectors. Reductions have been dominated by the power sector, which was
responsible for 85% of the total reduction in emissions from 2016 to 2018. Emissions
from manufacturing and construction (-9%) and fuel supply (-7%) have also fallen,
but emissions in all other sectors fell by an average of just 1%. In particular, the
slowdown and closure of Aberthaw coal fired power station contributed to 55%
of the total fall in emissions between 2016 and 2020.
Emissions from agriculture and land use, land use change and forestry did
not change between 2016 and 2018, and have only reduced by 13% since 1990.
Emissions from livestock account for 54% of agricultural emissions. Wales reduced
its tree planting target from 5,000 hectares per year to 2,000 hectares per
year. Trees play a crucial role in removing emissions from the atmosphere.
Disappointingly, in 2019, only 80 hectares of trees were planted in Wales. The
planting of a National Forest has begun in earnest this year, and the previous
Welsh Government hoped that a new sustainable land management approach
will help to address emissions from the agricultural sector.
Surface transport is Wales’ third largest source of emissions. Between 2016 and
2018 emissions from surface transport fell by 2%, but emissions in 2018 were still
3% higher than the baseline. The Welsh Government recently published its new
transport strategy, focusing on active travel and supporting the transition to
electric vehicles. Time will tell whether this marks a shift in our stubbornly high
emissions from transport.
Emissions from buildings have also increased since 2014. The rate of installation
of new renewable energy capacity has fallen every year since 2015. And between
2016 and 2018 emissions from aviation increased by 29%. But there are glimmers of
hope. Waste sector emissions continue to decline, and the new circular economy
strategy aims to capitalise on Wales progress to date, and its position as third best
in the world for recycling.
122

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

Are we doing enough?
While there have been some reductions in emissions in recent years, and a
renewed commitment from the previous Welsh Government to tackling climate
change, there is still much more to be done. The second low carbon delivery plan
is due to be published in November 2021, and will set out polices and proposals to
meet the second carbon budget. The CCC recommended that the plan should go
further, setting out a long-term vision to meet the net-zero goal.
Members of the Sixth Senedd will have a central role in scrutinising the plan
and holding the new Welsh Government to account on progress. The CCC has
estimated the costs of hitting the targets as being an additional £3 billion per
year by 2030 for Wales – so scrutiny of Welsh Government spending on the
decarbonisation agenda, and whether it’s delivering on ambition, will also be key.
The CCC highlights that gaps remain – particularly the lack of underlying
indicators to measure progress, and lack of a cohesive, economy-wide emissions
reduction strategy for 2050. It cautions that Wales is not currently on track to
meet an 80% emissions reduction target by 2050, let alone net-zero. The Welsh
Government’s next low carbon delivery plan will be crucial in assessing how
serious Wales is about tackling the climate crisis.

Clean air for Wales
Wales has some of the worst air quality in the UK. Why does
air quality matter and what might we see during the Sixth
Senedd to tackle the pollution problem?
Francesca Howorth
Wales has some of the worst air quality in the UK. Cardiff and Port Talbot have
recorded higher particulate matter levels than Birmingham or Manchester and
a road in Caerphilly recorded the highest levels of pollution outside of London.
Some areas in Wales have breached EU regulations for several years, culminating in
the last Welsh Government being taken to court for its lack of action.

Why does air quality matter?
Public Health Wales has described outdoor air pollution as the greatest
environmental risk to health. It estimates between 1,000-1,400 deaths per year in
Wales can be attributed to exposure to air pollution.
Poor air quality has huge social costs through its impacts on health, and adverse
effects on wildlife and biodiversity. But tackling air pollution is not only a health or
environmental issue, it’s a matter of social justice. Researchers have described a
‘triple jeopardy effect’ at play – where those from a low socio-economic status are
exposed to higher levels of pollution because of where they live or work. A 2016
study found air pollution to be higher in Wales’ most deprived areas. It concluded
that air pollution, deprivation and health are inextricably linked.
On a global scale, the World Bank estimates the cost associated with health
damage from air pollution to be $5.7 trillion, equivalent to 4.8% of global GDP.

How is air quality managed?
Air pollution limits in Wales are set by a range of UK and European regulations.
The European Union Ambient Air Quality Directive sets legally binding limits for
certain pollutants in outdoor air. Following the UK’s exit from the EU, these limits
have been retained.
Air quality management in Wales mainly takes place at local authority level using
a variety of monitoring methods. Local authorities produce annual progress

124

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

reports and identify any areas where limits are likely to be exceeded. Where this is
the case they must implement an Air Quality Management Area (AQMA). There are
currently 44 AQMAs across Wales.

Which pollutants are most concerning?
The main air pollutants that affect our health are nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone
(O3) and other small, particulate matter (PM). PM is the term for a mixture of solid
particles and liquid droplets found in the air and is classified by size, with PM2.5
representing smaller size particles than PM10. PM2.5 is considered to be the more
dangerous to health.

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

Most breaches of EU limits within the UK are a result of roadside NO2, 80% of
which comes from road transport. Of Wales’ 44 AQMAs, all have been declared for
NO2, with the exception of Neath Port Talbot which has been declared for PM10. The
Port Talbot AQMA covers land and properties between the steel works and the M4
motorway.
In 2018, breaches of NO2 limits saw the then Welsh Government taken to court.
The High Court ruled that the Welsh section of the UK’s plan to tackle roadside NO2
did not satisfy EU requirements. It also ruled that managing exceedances of NO2
on the motorway and trunk road network was the direct responsibility of the Welsh
Government. The then Welsh Government published its supplemental plan to the
UK plan for tackling roadside nitrogen dioxide concentrations later that year.
To tackle NO2 emissions, 50mph speed limits have been introduced at five sites
on the trunk road and motorway network. The latest annual report on roadside
NO2 concentrations says that although emissions are falling at all five sites, the
situation remains “complicated”.
In March 2021 the then Welsh Government launched the new Wales Transport
Strategy. It includes a sustainable transport hierarchy which places travel by private
motor car at the bottom of the list. It also sets a target for 45% of journeys to be
made by public transport, walking or cycling by 2040. It’s currently estimated that
32% of journeys are made this way.

Was the pandemic good for air quality?
It’s complicated.
On a global scale, lockdowns resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic led to
the largest reduction in greenhouse gas emissions ever recorded. Research
published in March 2021 found that emissions would need to drop by the
equivalent of a global lockdown roughly every two years to meet the goals of the
Paris Agreement on Climate Change.
In 2020 the then Welsh Government commissioned a report from its independent
Clean Air Advisory Panel to explore the pandemic’s impact on air quality in Wales.
It found that NO2 levels decreased by an average of 36% at roadside monitoring
sites for the period February to May 2020.
But the report paints a mixed picture. While lockdown saw reduced traffic and
decreased NO2 levels, increases in PM levels were recorded. While this can partly

126

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

be attributed to weather conditions, it’s suggested this may also be due to an
increase in waste being burnt, with household waste and recycling centres closed
during lockdown.
Responding to the report, Public Health Wales said the analysis shows that
achieving significant change in travel behaviour is possible. In September 2020
the last Welsh Government announced its aim for 30% of the Welsh workforce to
work remotely.

What could be on the horizon to tackle Wales’ pollution
problem?
In August 2020 the last Welsh Government launched its Clean Air Plan for Wales:
Healthy Air, Healthy Wales.
It identified a range of actions:

 investing in active travel infrastructure;
 strengthening the control of emissions in agriculture – the last Welsh
Government introduced controversial regulations that came into force in April
2021;

 publishing a Clean Air Zone Framework for Wales in Spring 2021, taking into
account the findings of a review into road user charging; and

 implementing a national air pollution and monitoring service by December
2022.
The plan also set out an intention to introduce a new Clean Air Act for Wales. In
January 2021, the last Welsh Government published a White Paper setting out a
number of legislative proposals.
An indicative timetable within the White Paper suggests drafting of the Bill
would commence in 2022. Healthy Air Cymru welcomed the plans but says the
timetable for enacting the legislation is “far too slow”. It points to the fact that “it
could be as late as 2024 before any regulations come into effect”.
The White Paper includes proposals to:

 introduce a legal requirement for a Clean Air Plan or Strategy to be reviewed at
least every 5 years;

127

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

 strengthen powers for local authorities to address vehicle idling, including
powers to increase the fixed penalty amount that can be issued;

 introduce an enhanced Local Air Quality Management Regime; and
 enact a new target for PM levels, taking account of World Health Organisation
(WHO) guidelines – the WHO has recommended guidelines for PM2.5 levels that
are half the current EU limit.
It also makes proposals in relation to smoke control areas where it is an offence
to emit smoke from a chimney of a building unless using an approved fuel or
appliance. It proposes that these powers are extended to include outdoor burning
such as bonfires.
Alongside the White Paper the last Welsh Government launched a consultation
on proposals to reduce emissions from domestic burning of solid fuel. It proposes
a ban on the sale of wet wood and traditional house coal – fuels which some in
rural areas rely upon to heat their homes. Similar measures have already been set
out in England.
Whether these plans are a breath of fresh air or the outlook remains hazy is yet
to be seen. What is clear is that air quality will be a major challenge for the next
Welsh Government to address.

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

A new landscape for farmers and nature?
The Sixth Senedd will see the biggest change to land
management policy in decades. What could this mean for
rural communities and the natural environment?
Katy Orford
Leaving the EU means Wales is able to develop novel agricultural schemes. Farming
policy, which is devolved, has implications for the environment, economy and
culture of Wales and has been a hot topic since the EU referendum.
The last Welsh Government proposed to fundamentally change farming policy
to support wider sustainable land management, moving away from payment
for food production in its own right. While environmentalists have welcomed
this approach, tensions have risen in farming communities with the unions
calling for payments for producing food. Future policy decisions will be made
within a complex agri-food trading landscape and amidst the climate and nature
emergencies.

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

Leaving the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy behind
The UK joined the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in 1973. Originally,
farmers received income to supplement prices paid for their produce to ensure
food security and a good standard of living. But this encouraged overproduction,
resulting in the notorious ‘wine lakes’ and ‘butter mountains’ of the late 20th
century.
A major CAP reform in 2005 moved to payments broadly based on the area of
land farmed. Farmers received direct payments (most recently through the Basic
Payment Scheme (BPS)) and also support for rural development (for example
the Glastir agri-environment scheme).
Many farmers in Wales have relied heavily on the CAP for income, particularly the
BPS, more so than in any other UK country.
Farm income

* LFA = Less Favoured Area, ** BPS = Basic Payment Scheme

Now the UK has left the CAP, an interim CAP-style system is being maintained
under the UK Agriculture Act 2020 until Wales transitions to new domestic
schemes. There has been disagreement between the Welsh Government and
UK Government over whether commitments to provide full replacement funding
for the schemes have been met. This is due to different interpretations of
ongoing EU funding being provided through the Rural Development Programme.

130

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

Some see exit from the CAP as an opportunity for radical change arguing that
the CAP restricted environmental improvement, distributed payments unfairly
.(due to larger farms receiving more support) and was too complex.
Others remain cautious given the high reliance on BPS income and the
uncertainty associated with leaving the EU and the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Welsh Government published a White Paper in December 2020 for
an Agriculture (Wales) Bill (planned for summer 2022) to establish new land
management schemes.

A future farming policy based on public goods?
The White Paper proposals set out a very different and ambitious approach to
agricultural support. Based on the principle of sustainable land management, the
policy would reward farmers for providing ‘public goods’ from the land, including
both social and environmental outcomes. The policy arguably goes beyond the
CAP, supporting wider land management improvement.
Contrary to the CAP, farmers would not receive support specifically for producing
food. The Welsh Government has argued that as food has a market value it should
not be classed as a public good, and so should not be directly funded by the state.
Instead, funding would focus on the non-marketable benefits of sustainable food
production such as enhancing biodiversity and carbon sequestration (capturing
and storing carbon). This might be through enhancing wildflower diversity on
farms or tree planting alongside food production.
Environmentalists have broadly welcomed the proposals highlighting the climate
and nature emergencies. Some are calling for a quicker timeline for transition.
Conversely, farmers are calling for food production to be eligible for support in
its own right, holding concerns for the future of rural communities if this direct
support is lost.
The new proposals may require farm diversification which many have welcomed
to build business resilience. However academics have warned that farm
businesses in Wales face several hurdles to diversification, such as poor upland
land quality and remoteness from centres of population.

131

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

A new domestic and international trading landscape for the agrifood sector
The future agricultural policy will be developed in the context of new trade
agreements. Farmers are calling for a trade strategy that seeks to both
maximise access to overseas markets while safeguarding Wales’s high food and
farming standards.
Agri-food trade statistics (by value)
The latest information available is from 2019, before the UK left the EU
Common Market.
The UK agri-food sector relies heavily on foreign trade - in 2019 55% of food
and drink consumed in the UK was produced in the UK.
Imports: The EU has been the biggest source of the UK’s food and drink
imports: 26% of food and drink consumed in the UK in 2019 came from
the EU. The next biggest sources of food and drink imports were Africa, North
America, South America, and Asia (each of these categories providing 4% of
food consumed).
Exports: The EU is also the UK’s biggest food export market at just under
60% of food and drink exports in 2019. Wales exports a greater proportion
of its food and drink to the EU than the UK as a whole, at 75% of total Welsh
food and drink exports in 2019. The top non-EU destinations for Welsh
exports in 2019 were the USA, Turkey, Australia, Saudi Arabia and Canada.

The previous Welsh Government envisioned a Welsh food brand based on
environmental and social sustainability that would complement the public goods
scheme for farmers. The Welsh Government’s ability to achieve these ambitions
will be influenced by the UK Government’s decisions on international trade.
The UK Government says that new trade agreements could present
opportunities for the agri-food sector. However some Welsh businesses are
concerned about increased competition from imports with lower standards, as
well as new barriers to trade between the UK and EU.

132

At a UK level, constitutional arrangements for policy divergence are becoming
increasingly complex. Common frameworks and the UK internal market as
well as the UK’s international obligations all limit the Welsh Government’s
freedom to act in this area (see ‘Wales in the UK’ article.)
For example, the Internal Market Act 2020 will have significant implications for
agri-food policy. Part 1 of the Act means that products that meet the standards in
one part of the UK can automatically be sold anywhere else in the UK, even if the
standards are different. This has sparked concerns that the rules of the largest
market, England, will drive standards across the whole of the UK.

Developing a future farming policy amidst the climate and
nature emergencies
The agricultural policy will be developed in the context of the climate emergency,
declared by the Welsh Government and Senedd in 2019, and the nature crisis as
described by the environment sector.
The Convention on Biodiversity treaty recently concluded that the international
community failed its ten-year goal to halt the loss of nature by 2020. The
environment sector’s collaborative State of Nature Report 2019 highlighted that
17% of species in Wales are threatened with extinction (see climate change article).

133

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

Public and political emphasis on a
green recovery from the COVID-19
pandemic has stimulated debate
on ‘nature based solutions’ such as
catchment management to reduce
flooding and a national forest to
tackle climate change. The future
farming policy will no doubt feature in
these debates.

Under pressure: how are local government
services changing?
Are local government services at a tipping point? Following a
decade of austerity, and now a pandemic, what will services
look like in the future?
Osian Bowyer and Owen Holzinger
The funding pressures on local government over the last decade have been a
catalyst for change in local service delivery. Increasing costs and lower income for
local authorities means some services have reduced or are being run differently.
The pandemic put significant new demands on local government, exacerbating
existing pressures. The future of local government services is uncertain and how it
responds to the challenges will shape those services for years to come.

How has spending on local services changed?
The shape of local authority services has changed significantly over the last
decade.
Overall local authority spending has decreased by around 7% since 2013-14 (in
real terms), in contrast expenditure on social services has increased by over 10%.
Spending in most other service areas has been cut, including in education.
Planning and economic development services have been hit particularly hard, as
have libraries, culture, heritage, sport and recreation services.

expenditure on services by the 22 local authorities in 2019-20.

But while social services have been protected from the most severe spending
reductions, this won’t be enough to ensure its sustainability for the future. A 2017
report by Wales Public Services 2025 found that:
… spending through local authorities on social care for the over 65s is
not keeping pace with the growth in the population of older people.
Spending may need to have increased by at least £129 million (23%)
between 2015-16 and 2020-21 to get back to the equivalent spend perhead in 2009-10.
The ONS estimates that, between 2021 and 2031, the population of Wales will
grow by just over 60,000 (1.9%). Within that population growth, there’s a projected
increase in the proportion of older people. The population of over 65s is due to
increase by around 119,000 (17.5%).
Wales Fiscal Analysis notes that, while future demand for care can’t simply be
linked to growth in older populations, a projected growth in older people with
complex care needs is highly likely to result in increased pressure on care services.
It details that the number of older adults living with severe dementia is expected
to double to 53,700 by 2040. The Inter-Ministerial group on paying for social care
estimated in a ‘high-cost’ scenario that, between 2019-20 and 2022-23, the net
costs of social care could increase by almost £400 million.

140

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

Wales Fiscal Analysis projects that by 2025-26, social services could account for
55% of all local government spending pressures, with school pressures accounting
for a further 21%.

Increased reliance on council tax?
Where local authorities get the money to spend on services has also started to shift.
There’s been a reduction in grant funding to local authorities over the period 201314 to 2019-20, some of which has been mitigated by local taxes. While grant funding
still makes up the majority of local authority income, the amount to be collected
from council tax payers (excluding council tax benefit/reduction scheme funding)
was up by almost 30% over the same period.
The overall increase reflects annual increases in council tax paid by residents
over the period. With average band D council tax (excluding the police element)
increasing in real terms by £186.
However, local authorities have consistently warned that raising council tax is not,
on its own, sufficient to fill funding gaps in the future. Despite a recent boost to
local government finances, there are potential signs of turbulence ahead.
Following the UK Budget 2021, Wales Fiscal Analysis notes that, “the UK
government’s medium-term spending plans make for a more austere outlook for
the Welsh budget and Welsh public services” and outline the possibility of a return
to austerity for parts of the Welsh budget.
The financial impact of the pandemic on local government is likely to be felt for
many years. Audit Wales notes that, even in local authorities generating a budget
surplus in 2018-19, some had significant overspends in demand-led services like
social services. It suggests those pressures are likely to intensify as a result of the
pandemic.

Improving public services: a cultural shift
Local government has in the last few years embarked on a journey to transform
how it delivers services. Local authorities are thinking differently about how to
improve services for users, while reducing the cost of running them. An example of
this is ‘one-stop-shops’ or ‘hubs’. These hubs host multiple council services under
one roof, such as libraries, money advice and adult learning services.

141

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

One of the most significant aspects of the transformation programme is to
make better use of technology and digital tools. The previous Welsh Government
established a Local Government Digital Transformation Fund to “maximise and
identify opportunities to progress the digital transformation of local government in
Wales”.
The Digital Strategy for Wales, launched in March 2021 is another step in this
journey. It sets out a national vision for digital transformation, and seeks a cultural
shift in how public bodies “deliver and modernise services” that are designed
around user needs.
In the past year, local authority resources have been diverted from some of this
transformational work. Anticipated financial savings are less certain, with the
WLGA recently suggesting there’s doubt about when, and indeed if, some of
those savings will now happen.
Yet there are examples of how the pandemic has sped-up digital change across
local government:

 establishing an all-Wales virtual autism team, which includes professionals and
people with autism;

 developing community support mobile apps to coordinate volunteering; and
 developing virtual learning and delivery platforms to engage, educate, inform
and support young people.
Developing on areas of digital innovation and good practice will likely be one
priority area for the next Minister with responsibility for local government.

What next for local government?
The passing of the Local Government and Elections (Wales) Act 2021 gives local
authorities new tools and powers to deal with some of the many challenges facing
the sector.
For example, the Welsh Government suggests the general power of
competence within the Act enables local authorities to consider more
transformative approaches to service delivery. The Act also lays the groundwork
for Corporate Joint Committees (CJCs), bodies designed to enable greater regional
working and collaboration in areas like education and transport.

142

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

However, questions remain about how these new bodies will operate. Responses
to a recent consultation on CJCs by the previous Welsh Government show there’s
still uncertainty about how they’ll function and their associated costs and benefits.
Despite the recent increase in the local government settlement for next year,
and the substantial funding support in response to the pandemic, significant
challenges remain. Wales Fiscal Analysis suggests that to meet cost pressures
over the next few years, spending on local services needs to increase, on average,
by 3.4% a year (in cash terms) between 2020-21 and 2025-26.
The WLGA recently reported that core pressures, that’s the financial gap in
money coming in and that required to pay for services, could amount to as much
as £822 million by 2023-24. Leaning on local taxation, such as council tax, to
support key services like social care and education won’t stem the demand for,
and cost of providing those services.
The challenges of the last 12 months have nevertheless brought with them
opportunities. Local government has adapted quickly to new ways of working
using digital approaches to deliver improved and responsive services to users.
Sustaining such momentum and investment will be critical to recovery in the
coming years.

Taxing times in the Sixth Senedd?
What will Welsh taxes look like in the future? Will local taxes
be reformed and will the Welsh Government introduce new
taxes in the Sixth Senedd?
Christian Tipples
In April 2018, the first Welsh taxes in almost eight hundred years were introduced
using newly devolved powers.
Significant issues may need to be confronted in the Sixth Senedd. It’s unclear how
the pandemic will impact devolved tax policy, particularly income tax. Criticisms of
the approach to local taxation and proposals for new taxes developed in the Fifth
Senedd may also lead to big changes.
Yet tax policy is a sensitive subject so implementing any changes may prove
challenging for the next Welsh Government.

New taxes for Wales
In 2018, Land Transaction Tax (LTT) and Landfill Disposals Tax (LDT), replaced UK
Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) and Landfill Tax (LT) becoming the first uniquely Welsh
taxes since the 13th century.
This was followed by the implementation of Welsh Rates of Income Tax (WRIT)
in April 2019, which is the largest source of tax revenue available to the Welsh
Government.
The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the body responsible for forecasting
Welsh tax revenues, estimated that the Welsh Government would receive over
£2.1 billion in WRIT revenue in 2021-22, while LTT and LDT would raise £260 million
(before an extension to the LTT holiday) and £34 million respectively.
Welsh tax revenues represent 17% of the Welsh Government’s budget for 2021-22.

WRIT changes
There have yet to be any changes to WRIT with Welsh Labour committing in 2019
not to increase income tax rates during the Fifth Senedd.
However, given the economic challenges faced by Wales due to the COVID-19
pandemic, the Sixth Senedd could see pressure for the first rate changes to
WRIT .
The porous nature of the Wales-England border means any divergence between
UK and Welsh income tax rates could lead to taxpayers migrating across the
border, impacting on future WRIT revenues.
Given that nearly 48% of the Welsh population live within 25 miles of the border
and 4.9 million within a similar distance on the English side, this could be a
significant issue.

145

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

Local taxes
Council tax is one of the financial levers available to local government. Around £1.8
billion is raised annually from 1.4 million dwellings.
The Welsh Government has amended the council tax regime in various ways.
For example, in the Fifth Senedd local authorities gained powers to charge a
premium of up to 100% on second homes.
An Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) review, published last year, concluded that
council tax was “out of date, regressive and distortionary”, suggesting it needed to
be “revalued and reformed”.
Non-domestic rates (NDR) – often known as ‘business rates’ - are also a significant
revenue source, generating over £1 billion annually for local government. Those
funds are collected and pooled nationally before being redistributed among local
government bodies. Revaluations are more frequent than for council tax, the most
recent having taken place in 2017. The next list was originally planned for 2021,
but due to the pandemic will not come into effect until 2023 in order to “better
reflect the impact of COVID-19”.
A number of changes to NDR were made in the Fifth Senedd, including
implementing a permanent Small Business Rates Relief scheme, switching
the inflation measure used for uprating from RPI to CPI and efforts to tackle
avoidance.
The UK Government is currently undertaking a fundamental review of business
rates (due to conclude in autumn 2021), any changes may have implications for
the pace of change in Wales. That review considers the possibility of more frequent
- three yearly - revaluations, something that has already been implemented in
Scotland.

Alternative approaches to local taxes
Several studies have acknowledged that council tax is regressive. As such, the
Welsh Government has looked at the feasibility of replacing council tax and NDR
with a local land value tax (LVT). This system of taxation operates in Denmark, New
Zealand and some parts of Australia and the United States.
LVT is a levy on the value of land and, unlike most property taxes, is a tax on the
land itself disregarding the value of any improvements made to that land.

146

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

The Welsh Government commissioned Bangor University to conduct an initial
feasibility study of LVT. It found that that while it could raise sufficient revenues
to replace current local taxes, the data requirements to implement LVT weren’t
currently met.
The previous Finance Minister, Rebecca Evans, told the Fifth Senedd’s Finance
Committee that the Welsh Government has also commissioned the Institute
for Fiscal Studies to consider the impact of a council tax revaluation to make the
system less regressive, and Cardiff University to conduct research into whether
council tax could be based on local assessments of household income.

New taxes
The Wales Act 2014 enables the Welsh Government to seek competence from
both Houses of the UK Parliament and the Senedd to introduce new taxes to
Wales. The Welsh Government is currently seeking powers for a vacant land tax
and investigating three other potential areas for new taxes:

 Social care levy;
 Disposable plastic tax; and
 Tourism tax.
The last Welsh Government found the process “protracted and challenging”, and
claimed the mechanism is “not fit for purpose”. The Minister stated:
It has become apparent there are serious flaws in the agreed process for
devolution of further tax competence. As the process currently stands, it
is difficult to envision a scenario whereby the Welsh Government could
successfully make the case for further tax competence. The process
needs urgent review and reform.
This is highlighted in the Minister’s recent final report on the implementation and
operation of the financial powers devolved in the Wales Act 2014. The report also
provides an update on the other potential areas for new taxes.
How the next Welsh Government can drive changes to this process, and the type
of new taxes it could introduce, will play a significant role in tax policy over the next
Senedd term.

Budgeting for recovery
The Fifth Senedd saw a move away from austerity and ended
with massive public spending to deal with the pandemic.
How has spending changed? And what pressures lie ahead
for Wales?
Owen Holzinger
Spending on public services since the 2008 financial crisis has largely been
characterised by austerity.
At the Spending Round in September 2019, the UK Government signalled it was
“turning the page on austerity and beginning a new decade of renewal”. The
Welsh Government’s 2019-20 and 2020-21 budgets were subsequently referred
to as “a step-change in the path of the Welsh resource budget”.

Budgets in the Fifth Senedd
While budgets in the Fifth Senedd saw an increase in the Welsh Government’s
spending power, it’s only since 2019-20 that the total Welsh budget has increased to
levels above 2009-10 (in real terms). Even with that, spending on Welsh Government
departments has generally remained below historic levels.

2020 (dashed) and those at the Third Supplementary Budget (February 2021) are included. Real
terms figures reflect atypical movement in the 2020-21 GDP deflator.

The pandemic meant spending in 2020-21 looks very different to initial proposals.
The Welsh Government’s Third Supplementary Budget 2020-21 allocated almost
£25 billion to departments, a significant increase from the £18 billion originally
planned.
While the Welsh Government reprioritised some departmental spend, most of
the increase is the result of spending decisions around the pandemic in England.
The current budget for 2021-22 therefore sees a decrease in overall allocations to
around £20 billion.

150

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

Health and Social Services is consistently the biggest area of Welsh Government
spending. In terms of day-to-day revenue spending it takes up over half of the
2021-22 budget. Alongside Housing and Local Government, the next largest area
of Welsh Government expenditure, those two areas make up around 80% of
departmental revenue budgets in 2021-22.

The Fiscal Framework
The rules around Welsh Government funding are set out in the Fiscal Framework.
Most of the Welsh Government’s money comes through the Welsh block
grant, linked to UK Government spending through the Barnett Formula. This
arrangement was bypassed to some extent during the pandemic, with the UK
Government offering a ‘guarantee’ of funding.
How the Barnett Formula works
The Barnett formula calculates the annual change in the block grant. It uses
the annual change in a UK Government department’s budget and applies a
comparability percentage based on the extent to which that department’s
services are devolved, it also takes into account the relative population of
Wales.
Wales also has a block grant floor, which ensures Wales’ funding will converge
to a level in line with Wales’ needs. It is set at 115%. Currently the needs based
factor is 105% as Wales’ relative funding per head is around 120%. Once Wales’
relative funding reaches 115% of England’s, the multiplier will be locked at 115%.

Other fiscal measures were perhaps not flexible enough when put under the
strain of the pandemic. The Wales Reserve is capped at £350 million and limited
to an annual maximum drawdown of £125 million revenue and £50 million capital.

151

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

The significant COVID-19 funding that came to Wales at the end of 2020-21, due to
policy decisions in England, meant more flexibility was required to carry forward
up to an additional £650 million.
On the other hand, the Welsh Government hasn’t used all of the fiscal tools at its
disposal. It can borrow up to £150 million capital annually, but hasn’t done so in
2019-20 or 2020-21.
These issues led the Fifth Senedd’s Finance Committee to suggest that funding
mechanisms needed urgent review. The Committee suggested:

 capital borrowing limits should be increased;
 there should be greater flexibility around the Wales Reserve; and
 there should be an independent process for challenging funding decisions,
noting the UK Government acted as ‘judge and jury’ when it comes to Wales’
funding arrangements.

New powers for UK investment in Wales
The Internal Market Act 2020 allows the UK Government to provide financial
assistance for various purposes (see our article on Wales in the UK), anywhere
in the UK. It gives the UK Government new powers to directly fund activity in
devolved policy areas.
Two specific funds will take advantage of these powers:

 the UK Shared Prosperity Fund (starting with the UK Community Renewal
Fund), which will replace EU structural funds; and

 the ‘Levelling Up Fund’. Initially a fund for England, but subsequently extended
to cover the whole of the UK.
Debate around the use of these powers has already begun.
The previous Welsh Government suggested the UK Government planned
to “bypass the devolution settlement” and the three Finance Ministers of the
devolved nations issued a joint statement in March stating the UK Government
was “ignoring [their] respective devolution arrangements”.

152

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

However, the Secretary of State for Wales, Simon Hart, suggested funds would
have “a greater degree of local input” and that they represented an “extension of
the devolution process”.
It’s unclear how or whether the Welsh Government will be involved in these
spending decisions, and how they will be scrutinised.

Familiar but signif icant pressures ahead?
The costs of the pandemic will undoubtedly shape the future of public sector
finances. UK Government borrowing is due to hit a peacetime high of £355 billion
in 2020-21 and forecast at £234 billion for 2021-22. Headline debt for the UK is due
to hit 100% of GDP in 2020-21 (see article on economic recovery).
At the UK Government Budget in March 2021 the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak,
outlined the need to “begin the work of fixing our public finances”. The Chancellor
now plans to spend between £14-17 billion a year less on public services each
year after 2021, than was planned prior to the pandemic. It’s been suggested that
medium-term spending plans make for “a more austere outlook for the Welsh
budget and Welsh public services”.
The implications of the pandemic for public finances won’t just be in terms of
immediate financing of the response, but the long term pressures it creates
for services. The previous Welsh Government allocated £320 million for a
reconstruction package and £225 million for a capital stimulus package. The
costs of recovery are only likely to increase.
It’s been suggested that the NHS and Social Care in England would need an
additional £12 billion a year to make up lost ground. In Wales, the NHS waiting
list reached a record high of 549,353 in February 2021 (see article on NHS waiting
times). The previous Minister for Health and Social Services, Vaughan Gething,
estimated recovery would take at “least a full Senedd term”. A recovery plan for
Health published in March outlined an “initial” £100 million of funding.
Similarly, school closures led to the previous Welsh Government providing
additional funding for pupils (see article on education in the time of COVID), but
the scale and costs for pupils to ‘catch-up properly’ could be as much as “half a
year of schooling”, around £1.4 billion.

153

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

Others have called on the Welsh Government to exploit the opportunities that
recovery presents to build back greener, including investing in green infrastructure,
transforming transport and public spaces, and promoting remote working.
Analysis suggests funding these pressures could lead to a return to austerity
for parts of the Welsh Government’s budget, based on current UK Government
spending plans. How these pressures emerge and are addressed will be a driving
force for policy and spending decisions in the Sixth Senedd.

Wales in the UK
Brexit has fundamentally changed the responsibilities of
governments across the UK, making it more important
than ever for them to cooperate. Can they find ways to work
together effectively?
Lucy Valsamidis and Nia Moss
We think of responsibility for policy as either devolved to the Senedd or reserved to
Westminster. The reality is more complex. The boundaries of where power lies are
often blurred. Governments across the UK need to find ways to work together to
manage these tensions – or risk failing to make effective policy decisions and tackle
shared challenges.
Brexit blurred these lines of responsibility further by transferring powers previously
exercised by the EU to Wales and Westminster. Since 2016, the governments have
worked to develop new ways of managing these powers. But they have struggled
to agree on how these new structures should work and where responsibility
should lie.

Brexit has shifted powers to governments in Wales and
Westminster
The Welsh Government is now responsible for about 4,000 new functions
previously exercised at EU level. To take just one example, it can now change how
water safety and quality are monitored. Constraints on the Senedd’s powers set by
EU law have been removed – so if the Senedd wanted to change retained EU law
on water quality, it could do that too.
The UK Government also has a wide range of new responsibilities in reserved
areas which impact on devolved policy, from establishing a new UK residency
scheme for EU citizens to negotiating new international trade agreements (see
the article on Wales in the new international landscape).
Control of funding in devolved areas has changed too. For example, where the
Welsh Government previously managed about £295 million per year in EU
structural funds, the UK Internal Market Act 2020 now gives the UK Government
powers to spend money in devolved areas like health and education. The UK

158

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

Government plans to use these powers to establish a new Shared Prosperity Fund
and a Levelling Up Fund (see ‘budgeting for recovery’ article). The total value of this
funding is not yet known.

The governments have developed ways of managing their new
responsibilities – but tensions remain
The governments recognised that they would need to change the way they worked
together to manage these new responsibilities. For example, if the UK Government
negotiates an international trade agreement that requires animal health checks
on exports, the Welsh Government has to make or agree legislation to implement
those checks. Equally, if the Senedd decides to ban the sale of certain sugary drinks,
that could affect drinks producers based outside Wales too.
They sought to develop ‘common frameworks’ in about 26 policy areas, including
food safety and air quality. These are agreements to work together to decide when
to align policy and when to diverge, sometimes underpinned by legislation. The
aim was to have all frameworks agreed by December 2020. But progress was
slowed by delays in the UK-EU negotiations and final agreement hasn’t yet
been reached.
In July 2020, the UK Government said that it didn’t believe that common
frameworks would be sufficient to manage divergence. It proposed what would
become the UK Internal Market Act 2020.
The Act establishes a new system for managing trade within the UK. At its heart
is the idea that goods and services that meet standards set in one country of the
UK should be able to be sold unhindered in the others, even if standards there are
different.

159

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

If the Senedd wants to ban the sale of certain sugary drinks, can it do this?
Does the Senedd have
the power to introduce
a ban?

Would the Welsh
Government need to
discuss and agree a
ban with the other
governments of the
UK?

Could the UK Internal
Market Act 2020 limit
the effect of a ban?

Yes. Food and drink
aren’t reserved in the
Government of Wales
Act 2006.

Yes. The governments
have agreed provisional
common frameworks on
food composition and
nutrition.

Yes. It’s likely that the
mutual recognition
principle would apply.
This would mean that if
the Senedd introduced
a ban on sugary drinks,
it wouldn’t apply to
drinks permitted in any
other part of the UK. The
UK Government could
exempt rules on sugary
drinks, but it doesn’t
have to do this.

So it’s likely they would
need to discuss and
agree whether to follow
the same rules or
diverge.

For example, the Senedd could ban single-use plastics. However, the Act means
any single-use plastics permitted or imported into the rest of the UK could still be
sold in Wales. The ban would apply to businesses based in Wales, but not to those
based elsewhere in the UK. So the Senedd would need to consider if a ban would
put businesses in Wales at a disadvantage – and if it would achieve its intended
purpose.
The last Welsh and Scottish Governments opposed the proposals. They said the
Act would go further than the rules of the EU single market in limiting divergence
within the UK. Committees in the Fifth Senedd also argued that it would set a
new limit on devolved powers. The UK Parliament passed the UK Internal Market
Bill in December 2020, after the Senedd and Scottish Parliament voted not to
grant legislative consent.

160

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

The future of intergovernmental relations is still emerging
With the Internal Market Act now law and the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation
Agreement reached, there are still questions about how the governments should
make decisions together and resolve disputes.
The Joint Ministerial Committee (JMC) has been the main structure for
managing intergovernmental relationships since 1999. The JMC is a set of
committees bringing together ministers from the UK and devolved governments.
They meet on an ad hoc basis to discuss common policy interests and address
disputes.
As things stand, the JMC can reach non-binding agreements, but can’t make
executive decisions. It can consider disputes between governments, but devolved
governments have criticised the dispute resolution process as weighted towards
the UK Government.
In 2018, the governments began a joint review of intergovernmental structures
“ensure they are fit for purpose in light of the UK’s exit from the EU”. Politicians from
different parties and parliaments agreed that “substantial reform” was needed.
Three years on, the governments set out progress with the review, including
proposals for new intergovernmental structures and a reformed dispute resolution
process. The then Counsel General Jeremy Miles called this progress, but said
he wanted further negotiation on how the governments should work together on
EU and international relations and on finance. The next Welsh Government will
need to decide how it wants to help shape the outcome of the review.

The Senedd will need to f ind ways of scrutinising how the
governments work together
Without finding effective ways to cooperate, the governments will risk failing to
develop law and policy that works for Wales. This means that the Sixth Senedd
will need to scrutinise how well the Welsh Government is working with the other
governments of the UK. It will also need to consider how proposed legislation and
common frameworks could develop alignment with, or divergence from, other
parts of the UK.

161

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

Understanding and influencing intergovernmental working can be difficult. People
and businesses can influence each government individually, but monitoring and
influencing negotiations between them is more challenging. And parliaments
must hold their own governments to account, so scrutiny of intergovernmental
working could fall between the cracks.
One way to improve scrutiny of intergovernmental working could be increasing
interparliamentary cooperation. The Interparliamentary Forum on Brexit (IPF) was
set up in 2017 to bring together representatives of committees from UK legislatures.
As well as recommending reform of intergovernmental relations, it called for
better parliamentary oversight. The IPF last met in September 2019.
The Fifth Senedd’s External Affairs and Additional Legislation Committee
supported increased interparliamentary working in its legacy report, saying
this “offers at least the prospect of occasional scrutiny outcomes that are greater
than the sum of their individual parts”. However it chooses to do it, the Sixth
Senedd will need not just to hold the Welsh Government to account for how
it works across the UK but to articulate and develop its own role in the UK’s
constitution.

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

Wales in the new international landscape
Over the course of the Fifth Senedd, the Welsh Government
and Senedd’s roles in international affairs changed
dramatically. The UK’s withdrawal from the EU has reframed
the UK’s approach to international engagement and has
required increased cooperation between the UK and devolved
governments. As a result, the role of the Senedd in the
scrutiny of international affairs looks set to increase.
Sara Moran and Rhun Davies
During the Sixth Senedd, the UK is expected to sign up to a wide range of new
international commitments affecting devolved policies and laws.
The Senedd’s scrutiny of international commitments matters. International
agreements often contain far reaching obligations which can impact on the
everyday lives of businesses and people in Wales. The Senedd’s ability to pass laws
is also constrained by what the UK Government agrees to on the international
stage. The Welsh Government’s ability to deliver its policies is also shaped by these
commitments. The UK Government has responsibility for leading negotiations
on new agreements but recognises the role the devolved institutions have in
implementing agreements in devolved areas.
Through careful scrutiny of international agreements, the Senedd has the potential
to add value for the benefit of Wales.

What new international agreements can be expected in the Sixth
Senedd?
A number of new international agreements of significance to Wales are expected
over the course of this Sixth Senedd. These include free trade agreements between
the UK and the US, New Zealand, Australia and the UK joining the Comprehensive
and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).
During the Sixth Senedd, the UK is also expected to sign up to new international
commitments in the fields of biodiversity, food, the marine environment and
climate change. These agreements will sit alongside Wales’ new relationship with
Europe.

163

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

The UK Government says that the trade agreements it’s negotiating will present
new opportunities for UK businesses, including those in Wales. Increasing UK
trade with other countries will likely create losers as well as winners. These new UK
agreements could result in Welsh businesses experiencing increased competition
from imports, with specific sectors affected differently. For example, a free trade
agreement with New Zealand has the potential to have a negative impact on
the UK’s agriculture and semi-processed food sectors, as New Zealand has a
comparative advantage in these sectors.
This is why the Senedd scrutiny of international agreements matters. The Fifth
Senedd’s External Affairs and Additional Legislation (EAAL) Committee said:
The Senedd has a role in identifying Welsh interests and, through
scrutiny and representation, ensuring that agreements are implemented
and developed in a way that maximise their benefits to Wales.

What role will the new Welsh Government play?
For the first time in over forty years, Brexit means that the UK Government is
negotiating and joining a number of international agreements with other countries
in its own right.
The devolution settlement means that the UK Government is responsible for
negotiating and entering into international agreements on behalf of the four
nations of the UK. However, once agreed, observing and implementing these
agreements in devolved areas is a matter for the Welsh Government and Senedd.

164

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

Engagement between the previous Welsh Government and the UK Government
on non-EU trade agreement negotiations took place through a then newlyestablished Ministerial Forum for Trade. However, a key Concordat on trade,
intended to formalise how the devolved governments can engage in the
negotiations themselves, hasn’t yet been agreed. In 2020, a Senedd committee
voiced its concern at the delay in finalising these arrangements.
The UK Government has also proposed new ways of working for the UK’s four
governments across over twenty policy areas (including fisheries, food and the
environment) under its new Common Frameworks programme. In part, the
programme aims to ensure that the four nations remain in compliance with
the UK’s international obligations while also offering new opportunities for the
devolved governments to participate in the UK’s international activities, such as
representation at international bodies.

How can Sixth Senedd scrutiny of UK international affairs benef it
Wales?
The Senedd’s approach to international affairs has undoubtedly changed during
the Fifth Senedd. The Fifth Senedd’s EAAL Committee developed a dedicated
scrutiny process for international agreements The Committee scrutinised over
100 trade and non-trade agreements. It took action by reporting on significant
agreements, as well as engaging with the Welsh Government and relevant
committees in other UK parliaments on matters of interest to Wales.
Examples of the scrutiny of international agreements by EAAL
Committee in the Fifth Senedd:
Trade agreements: roll-over of EU trade agreements including with Canada,
South Korea and Singapore, as well as future new agreements being
negotiated such as a potential UK-US trade agreement.
Non-trade agreements: citizens’ rights, elections and voting, fisheries, ports, air,
road and rail transport, social security, science and research, judicial
cooperation, film production and space.
Through careful scrutiny, the Sixth Senedd can make a difference in enhancing
the value of international agreements to Wales. For example, by giving a voice to
Welsh interests in situations where potential barriers to trade and opportunities for
improvements are identified.

165

What’s next? Key issues for the Sixth Senedd

How can the Welsh Government maximise new opportunities in
international affairs?
The international context in which the Sixth Senedd and new Welsh Government
will operate will have changed significantly compared to the previous Senedd as a
result of the UK’s exit from the EU and the economic impact of COVID-19. Against
this backdrop, as well as the UK’s evolving international relationships and new
international agreements, the Welsh Government will need to consider if and how
it wishes to promote Wales and Welsh businesses internationally.
In its international strategy, the previous Welsh Government set out its ambition
to increase Wales’ profile and influence in the world, as well as to grow the Welsh
economy by increasing exports and inward investment. The Welsh Government’s
network of 21 international offices are intended to play an important role in
promoting Wales internationally.
To maximise the opportunities presented by the UK’s new international agreements
and changing international context, the new Welsh Government may need to reconsider its international presence, where it’s located, how its relationships with UK
Government bodies and departments work and the focus of any strategy.

A new international chapter for Wales?
The way in which Welsh interests are reflected in the new international landscape
will be a key issue in the Sixth Senedd.
There’ll be new international commitments in important devolved areas. Members
of the new Senedd will need to understand what they mean for Wales and their
constituents.
The previous Welsh Government said that the UK’s departure from the EU and the
economic impact of COVID-19 means it’s essential for Wales to have a heightened
international profile. The new Welsh Government will need to decide whether it
shares this view and if so how it will deliver any international ambitions.
